Потім додали, створили моменти іреалізували їх. В третьому періоді далася в знаки наша краща фізичнаготовність, тому закинули ще 5 шайб. Рахунком я задоволений, але якістю гри -не зовсім. Я розраховував на спокійніший хід поєдинку», - сказав Шахрайчук.

Якщо ми вдало зіграємо дванаступних матчі, то ми матимемо шанс на підвищення. Постараємося знайти в собівсі сили, щоб здобути таку довгоочікувану перемогу», - пояснив Шахрайчук.

According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, she stated this at open debate in Radbeza Postpreda UK at Oonbarbar Woodward.

“We saw what the Russian idea of multilaterality means for the world. For more than a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, President Putin brought this Ukraine unimaginable suffering by trampling the UN Statute. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, millions were forced to leave their homes, and billions of people around the world have grown up with a rapid increase in prices for raw materials and brackets, ”she said.

According to Woodward, the war has also become a real catastrophe for Russia itself, which suffered numerous human losses. Millions flee from the country to avoid a prize, freedom of speech is suppressed, Russia's economy is declining, noted.

This was stated by the leader of the Belarusian opposition Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in the Berlin Power of Freedom, organized on April 24 by the German Fundmain, reports Ukrinform correspondent.

“The fate of Ukraine and [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bilorus)interconnected: not free Belarus without free Ukraine; There will also be no safe Belarus, ”Tikhanovskaya said.

She noted that hundreds of Belarusian volunteers are fighting side by side, many activists in the country themselves join in the guerrilla movement, volunteers collect information and transfer it to the Armed Forces. The Belarusian Vladagorstoko pursues people for it: on average, 20 people and protests against the regime, Tikhanovskaya.

She emphasized that Ukraine should provide everything needed in order to win it.

The oppositionist also urged the event to help hold Lukashenko's reference regime, as the tribunal should be not only for Putin, but also for her puppet - Lukashenko.

“Lukashenko knows that without Putin he will not last a day. Therefore, he allowed the Russian dictator to use the Belarusian territory for attack on Ukraine and supported this attack, ”Tikhanovskaya said, repeating that it was supported by Putin's war, not the Belarusian people.

“Putin wanted to do Ukraine as Belarus is today: a fully controlled puppet country with weak and humble government. But in the way of Lukashenko, who has completely obeyed Putin, the Ukrainian government of Inadrod stood up in defense of their state. The whole world is inspired by the determination of Ukrainian, ”the oppositionist emphasized.

According to her, plans to place nuclear weapons in Belarus will make 9 millions of Belarus hostages of two criminal regimes and create a constant threat to Ukraine, Europe, and the world.

“But the worst part will mean Russian control over Belarus for years. Mipovina is not allowed, ”Tikhanovskaya emphasized.

According to her, in 2020, Belarusians fought for the honest elections, today they will be fought for their sovereignty and the very existence of their country.

This was emphasized by Estonia Prime Minister Kai Callas in Zhytomyr during a joint briefing for journalists with President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We support the International Tribunal for Investigation of Aggression Crime. Military rooms can be considered by the International Criminal Court and Courts in Ukraine because they were committed here. If we talk about the crime of aggression, it is a crime of leaders. I am a lawyer by education and I can say that any hybrid tribunal will allow Putin, Laurel and others to avoid responsibility. The crime of aggression is Caeslochin, who is committed by leaders and they need to be held accountable, ”Callas reported.

According to her, it is mistaken to consider the Victory of the International Criminal Court's arrest for Putin's arrest for deportation of children.

According to Ukrinform, national [] reported on Monday [](https://www.lrt.lt/ua/novini/1263/1969246/litva-uspishno-provela-testove-vidkliuchennia-vid-rosiis-koyi-energosistemi).

The Litgrid Lithuanian Lithuanian operator completely interrupted all connections by the Ridgee Electricity Network as part of the preparation of synchronization with Western Europe. The tests were conducted from 11 to 21 hours. Thus, for the first time in history, the Lithuanian electricity system worked completely autonomously, stated in the company. At the same time, consumers did not notice the tests. At this time, electricity was supplied to the country's power grid by local electricity plants, as well as imports from Sweden and Poland.

“Lithuania proudly announces the successful completion of the 10-hour shutdown of the other electricity network from the Russian without any unplanned shutdowns. This discloses the path to complete and final shutdown next year, ”the Foreign Minister of Lithuania Gabrielus Landsbergis said.

Lithuania, as well as Latvia and Estonia, seek to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, looking for alternative sources of oil supply, gas tellectro -energy. In May 2022, they completely stopped importing in the Russian Federation.

Although the Baltic countries are no longer importing Russian energy such as gas and gas after invasion of Ukraine last year, they are still entrusted to the stability of their electricity system.

Both Russian and continental-European systems operate at 50 Hz, but while the Russian system is managed from Moscow, the continental Europe network is decentralized, which means that every national network operator is responsible for maintaining the stability of its system.

Russian troops deliberately fire residents, schools, churches, hospitals, evacuation corridors, use a system of filtration camps Tadeport people, carry out murder, torture, rape, kidnapping. residents, "Matviychuk said at the beginning of her output.

In the course of her speech, Matviychuk also shared with the audience the distinctions of the people who survived the Russian captivity, in particular, a pregnant woman who was torture from the Russian military.

"When I ask myself the question of how such a bloody war with such a huge scale of violations of international humanitarian law, international criminal law and all basic standards in the field of human rights is stalmozing in our region - then I remember that Russian military enlightenment is the most serious war. Moldova, Georgia, Mali, Syria, Libya and other countries.The chairman of the Civil Liberty Center stressed that the Russian aggressive war of Ukraine "affected the dimension of values". "It's not just a war between two -states. It is a war between systems: between the authoritarian management system and the democratic system. [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin)To hide the vision around the world that democracy and human rights are excellent and false and that they cannot be protected from war. We need to answer this. We must show an example of justice, "Matviychuk said.

According to her, the first step in this direction should be the creation of an International Special Tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine and "bringing the reference of Putin, Lukashenko and others guilty of crimes." In addition, national systems need to be strengthened so that they can be able to investigate and persecute and persecute in thousands of criminal proceedings that are already officially registered. "

The Polish official emphasized that thanks to the adoption of this law, the process of creating the strongest ground forces in [] was developed in Polish(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evropa).

“We form many units, focusing energy and attention on the eastern part of our country. Because we proceed from the fact that even a piece of Polish lands cannot be given to the aggressor. We will not allow such tragic events of the Postlian land as in Bucha or Irpen, ”Blaschak stressed.

According to the Polish Viceremier, the theory that the army should be small, but well -trained, did not come true.

"The war in Ukraine shows that the army should be large and must also have a developed reserve," Blaschak emphasized.

According to him, the Polish army increased by almost 14,000 servicemen for nine months after the entry into force.

“This is the largest number(recruits in the army - ed.)from the moment of refusal of the draft, ie general military duty(In 2009 - ed.)”,” Blaschak said.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://oc-media.org/azerbaijan-closes-lachin-corridor-to-install-checkpoint/)On Sunday, the Azerbaijani border guards blocked the fare with a bridge of the Hakaripolis of the Armenian border.

Azerbaijan's authorities said this step was aimed at preventing the release of weapons and soldiers from Armenia to Nagorny Karabakh. In a statement, the Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry stated "systematic and large -scale abuse" of the corridor. They stated that the "control mechanism" will be implemented in "interaction with Russian peacekeeping".

[](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-azerbajdzan)He constantly accuses Armenia the Tarosian peacekeeping mission of transferring weapons and military personnel of Donagir Karabakh, both parties deny it.

Instead, Armenia accused Azerbaijan of using the closure of the fare to "break" peace talks between the two countries. The Sunday statement of the Ministry of Health called the UN to "take effective steps" to perform the decision of the UN International Court of Justice, which requires the restoration of the corridor.

Recall that in the Soviet times, Nagirny Karabakh was a member of the Azerbaijani All -University, although it was a region with an Armenian ethnic majority.

Baku states that the Armenian forces have intensified the supply of weapons to the Ethnic Armenians in recent days to bypass the so -called Lachynsky corridor.

In turn, the Armenian authorities of Nagorny Karabakh states that the mountain road was unused for the transportation of weapons, but only "for the organization(Azerbaijani name Hankendi)Tocartma by the communities of Shushinsky district. "

It was not only about the former autonomy, which was called the Zajadian times, was called the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, but also adjacent areas of Azerbaijan.

In recent years, Azerbaijan has conquered a large part of the territory, including part of Karabakh, in particular, Shush.

Instead, Ukrainians need long -range missiles and aviation to destroy Russian logistics in temporarily occupied territories and various types of aviation, he stated in [](https://twitter.com/Podolyak_M/status/1650491552613949445), reports Ukrinform.

"We see a strange media backing ..." On the anniversary of the war, Ukraine planned to strike the strikes in Moscow to all that it has, but partners refused, " - conspiratorically reported respected American media. Of course, without details of the logic camps. And so one simple question is right away. And why would we need to make a cellar? To what? What task would such a one -time action solve? Changed the course [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna)? Would the Russians run away? Canceled the broth in weapons? So, such publications with a mandatory reference to "anonymous sources" perform only one catastrophic function: forming a social opinion in the western capitals, as if Ukraine is unreasonable, infantile, an impulsive country, which adults are dangerous to trust. It is consciously done unconsciously - another question, ”Podolyak emphasized.

At the same time, he explained that the vision of Ukraine is quite different.

These are the main components of successful counter -offensive operations of taminimization of losses. Maybe it is not possible to play excuses and underwhelming realpolitik, will the war and people die? ” - said the adviser of the OP head.

This was stated in Luxembourg today during a press conference after the EU's Supervisor's results by EU High EU representative Josep Borrel, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We had a discussion in Ukraine as always. In the course conference, Minister Kuleba provided us with current information on the situation on the ground, the propriotic and needs of Ukraine. We know that Ukraine urgently requires water and rockets, and they need them to protect their territory. This is not that Russia does not want to stop, and Ukraine does not want to. NO. It can't be so presented. Russia does not want to stop the invasion, Aukraine is forced to continue to defend himself. This is the right way to explain that there is happening there, ”Borrel said.

"Given the horror that is happening in Ukraine, many people call for peace. I also call for peace. But these calls - where they were when the Russian troops were in the borders? We all want peace, and above all - the Ukrainians themselves. But it should be a fair peace, and until then we will need to support Ukraine's defense, ”the EU's high representative added.

In order for them to be effective, anyone should talk to Kiev, go there, see aggression with their own eyes, and look at it with the eyes of those who are under the bombs every day. Any such-person has a very clear imagination that there is an aggressor that has struck the International Charter and invaded another country, and there is a victim of this aggression, Borrel emphasized.As reported, the EU Council of Ministers in Luxembourg today took place in Luxembourg, the main topics of which were: discussing further assistance for Ukraine, in particular, with the urgent delivery between the EU and China.

This was stated in Luxembourg today by the EU's Foreign Affairs Supervisions in Luxembourg.

“Today we looked at the volume of supplies to Ukraine. I can assume that their general volume has already exceeded EUR 13 billion, only in the measurement of military support. We continue to fulfill our obligations to deliver 1 million units of artillery ammunition and missiles for Ukraine. Remember that we have developed the first, second and third paths for this purpose. The first tile envisaged the use of 1 billion euros to meet the most different needs of Ukraine. This work continues. I cannot give Valkretic figures, but more than 1000 rockets have already been provided to Ukraine, and the number of ammunition is increasing, although it should grow faster in the next days, ”Borrel said.

"In this(The second path - ed.)There are some differences, but we continue to work. We do not look forward to forming a legal document. The work is fully ready, until such a legal document is completed. The third way is to increase the capacity of our defense industry. My friend(European Commissar - Ed.)Tieri Breton will soon be presented with specific proposals for increasing defense production. For this, we will need to use what we have, but we have a multifaceted one, ”the high representative of the EU emphasized.

He also reminded that the military auxiliary mission of Ukraine, with the help of which more than 16 thousand Ukrainian servicemen have already undergone a training, continues to work, so the EU fulfills its obligation to provide a training for 30,000 military specialists by the end of the year.** Read also: ** [** Borrel **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3700110-sob-visuvati-mirni-propozicii-spocatku-potribno-vidvidati-ukrainu-borrel.html)As reported, the EU Council of Ministers of Ukraine was in Luxembourg today, the main topics of which were: discussing further assistance to Ukraine, in particular, the urgent delivery of ammunition to counteract Russian aggression, the development of the situation in Sudan, as well as to clarify the strategy of development of development between the EU and China.

The Belarusian Vladagorstoko pursues people for it: on average, 20 people and protests against the regime, Tikhanovskaya.

She emphasized that Ukraine should provide everything needed in order to win it.

The oppositionist also urged the event to help hold Lukashenko's reference regime, as the tribunal should be not only for Putin, but also for her puppet - Lukashenko.

“Putin wanted to do Ukraine as Belarus is today: a fully controlled puppet country with weak and humble government. But in the way of Lukashenko, who has completely obeyed Putin, the Ukrainian government of Inadrod stood up in defense of their state. The whole world is inspired by the determination of Ukrainian, ”the oppositionist emphasized.

And it is extremely important that we are beating on, it is a question of giving us Western fighters, at least a generation of "four plus". This is F-16, F-18, GriPen and similar aviation equipment with the capacity of modern NATO base aircraft. "

He tells in detail the military assistance provided by the Poles more than a hundred years ago, as well as the help that is now provided during the Russian-Ukrainian War.

- Poland and Ukraine have part of a common history. At this time, we want modern citizens of our countries to remember what connects us, - said the Director of the Polish Institute, Advisor to the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine Robertchizhevsky.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/img_0222.jpg)It is worth noting that the history of Ukrainian-Polish relations has a rich and saturated fire. The Poles and Ukrainians are not uncommon to unite. Especially if it went from the original enemy - Muscovy.

The importance of these and subsequent allied initiatives can be completely characterized by the words of Jerzy Gedroyts, a well -known Polish publicist, politician and public figure: "There is no independent Poland of inadvertent Ukraine."

- It was here in Kiev that joint hostilities with the participation of the UNR Army of Ipol soldiers against the Bolshevik authorities took place. As in 1920, a common enemy, a Russian aggressor, united the efforts of two neighboring peoples in our time. We see the sufferer that Poland is the most powerful lobbyist of Ukraine. It provides logistics support for Ukraine, assists weapons and equipment, has become a refuge of more than 3 million Ukrainians, - says Colonel Igor Kosyak, Head of the Center for Military History.Knowing the price of Russian occupation, Ukraine and Poland are doing everything to prevent the repetition of the events of 1920 and 2022. And from the beginning of the large -scale intensification of Russia, Poland has taken a clear pro -Ukrainian position.

- Maybe then in 1920 we did not win, but now our union is much more. After all, Ukraine enlisted the support of most countries of the world. And we will necessarily win. We continue to create a new Europe together. And this Europe will be released due to the courage and courage of Ukrainians, - said Volodymyr Tilishchak, Deputy Chairman of Ukrainian Institute of National Memory.
