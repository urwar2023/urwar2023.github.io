<p>Law enforcement officers found that the attacker has repeatedly certified their intentions to change the administrative and territorial structure of the Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>"From the beginning of the full -scale invasion of Russia, he has intensified the promotion of anti -state pro -Russian narratives, in particular, to continue to promote the Kremlin version of the" genocide of Rusynov ".

<p>In April this year, by the decision of the Uzhgorod City Court of the Transcarpathian region, the attacker was found guilty of committing the offenses under Part 2 of Art. 110 and Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine and sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment was imposed, informed in the SBU.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, she stated this at open debate in Radbeza Postpreda UK at Oonbarbar Woodward.</p>
<p>“We saw what the Russian idea of multilaterality means for the world. For more than a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, President Putin brought this Ukraine unimaginable suffering by trampling the UN Statute. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, millions were forced to leave their homes, and billions of people around the world have grown up with a rapid increase in prices for raw materials and brackets, ”she said.</p>
<p>According to Woodward, the war has also become a real catastrophe for Russia itself, which suffered numerous human losses. Millions flee from the country to avoid a prize, freedom of speech is suppressed, Russia's economy is declining, noted.</p>
<p>"Her army is in a disorder, relying on Wagner - a non -reporting group, whose existence was denied a year ago, but who now issues the advisory foreign ministry during your prescription," she said, addressing Lavrov.</p>

<p>"Despite all the statements of Lavrov's Minister on effective multilaterality, I am not seeing effective or multilateral in Russia's foreign policy," Woodward said.</p>
<p>According to her, if Lavrov is interested in ending the conflict as soon as possible, Russia should immediately withdraw its troops from all over the Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>This was emphasized by Estonia Prime Minister Kai Callas in Zhytomyr during a joint briefing for journalists with President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“We support the International Tribunal for Investigation of Aggression Crime. Military rooms can be considered by the International Criminal Court and Courts in Ukraine because they were committed here. If we talk about the crime of aggression, it is a crime of leaders. I am a lawyer by education and I can say that any hybrid tribunal will allow Putin, Laurel and others to avoid responsibility. The crime of aggression is Caeslochin, who is committed by leaders and they need to be held accountable, ”Callas reported.</p>
<p>According to her, it is mistaken to consider the Victory of the International Criminal Court's arrest for Putin's arrest for deportation of children. It takes place to take place in a very clear format, which will allow to attract the reference of leaders <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>- those who have decided to attack Ukraine. Callas emphasized that "there will be no victories without holding the reference of leaders."</p>
<p>She added that there could be no impunity and immunity for the crimes of the Russians, as crimes will encourage new atrocities without punishment.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, national [] reported on Monday <a href="https://www.lrt.lt/ua/novini/1263/1969246/litva-uspishno-provela-testove-vidkliuchennia-vid-rosiis-koyi-energosistemi"></a>.</p>
<p>The Litgrid Lithuanian Lithuanian operator completely interrupted all connections by the Ridgee Electricity Network as part of the preparation of synchronization with Western Europe. The tests were conducted from 11 to 21 hours. Thus, for the first time in history, the Lithuanian electricity system worked completely autonomously, stated in the company. At the same time, consumers did not notice the tests. At this time, electricity was supplied to the country's power grid by local electricity plants, as well as imports from Sweden and Poland.</p>
<p>“Lithuania proudly announces the successful completion of the 10-hour shutdown of the other electricity network from the Russian without any unplanned shutdowns. This discloses the path to complete and final shutdown next year, ”the Foreign Minister of Lithuania Gabrielus Landsbergis said.</p>
<p>Lithuania, as well as Latvia and Estonia, seek to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, looking for alternative sources of oil supply, gas tellectro -energy. In May 2022, they completely stopped importing in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Although the Baltic countries are no longer importing Russian energy such as gas and gas after invasion of Ukraine last year, they are still entrusted to the stability of their electricity system.</p>
<p>Both Russian and continental-European systems operate at 50 Hz, but while the Russian system is managed from Moscow, the continental Europe network is decentralized, which means that every national network operator is responsible for maintaining the stability of its system.</p>

<p>"I and other Ukrainian human rights activists are now working in conditions where the law is undeclared. Russian troops deliberately fire residents, schools, churches, hospitals, evacuation corridors, use a system of filtration camps Tadeport people, carry out murder, torture, rape, kidnapping. residents, "Matviychuk said at the beginning of her output.</p>
<p>She informed that after February 24, 2022, the Civil Freedom Center was united with dozens of regional organizations within the framework of the Putin Tribunal initiative: for the purpose of "documenting every episode of crimes of the Russian military in each of the most remote area of Ukraine."</p>

<p>In the course of her speech, Matviychuk also shared with the audience the distinctions of the people who survived the Russian captivity, in particular, a pregnant woman who was torture from the Russian military.</p>
<p>"When I ask myself the question of how such a bloody war with such a huge scale of violations of international humanitarian law, international criminal law and all basic standards in the field of human rights is stalmozing in our region - then I remember that Russian military enlightenment is the most serious war. Moldova, Georgia, Mali, Syria, Libya and other countries.The chairman of the Civil Liberty Center stressed that the Russian aggressive war of Ukraine "affected the dimension of values". "It's not just a war between two -states. It is a war between systems: between the authoritarian management system and the democratic system. <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin"></a>To hide the vision around the world that democracy and human rights are excellent and false and that they cannot be protected from war. We need to answer this. We must show an example of justice, "Matviychuk said.</p>
<p>According to her, the first step in this direction should be the creation of an International Special Tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine and "bringing the reference of Putin, Lukashenko and others guilty of crimes." In addition, national systems need to be strengthened so that they can be able to investigate and persecute and persecute in thousands of criminal proceedings that are already officially registered.

<p>This was stated in Luxembourg today during a press conference after the EU's Supervisor's results by EU High EU representative Josep Borrel, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“We had a discussion in Ukraine as always. In the course conference, Minister Kuleba provided us with current information on the situation on the ground, the propriotic and needs of Ukraine. We know that Ukraine urgently requires water and rockets, and they need them to protect their territory. This is not that Russia does not want to stop, and Ukraine does not want to. NO. It can't be so presented. Russia does not want to stop the invasion, Aukraine is forced to continue to defend himself. This is the right way to explain that there is happening there, ”Borrel said.</p>
<p>"Given the horror that is happening in Ukraine, many people call for peace. I also call for peace. But these calls - where they were when the Russian troops were in the borders? We all want peace, and above all - the Ukrainians themselves. But it should be a fair peace, and until then we will need to support Ukraine's defense, ”the EU's high representative added.</p>

In order for them to be effective, anyone should talk to Kiev, go there, see aggression with their own eyes, and look at it with the eyes of those who are under the bombs every day.

<p>This was stated in Luxembourg today by the EU's Foreign Affairs Supervisions in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>“Today we looked at the volume of supplies to Ukraine. I can assume that their general volume has already exceeded EUR 13 billion, only in the measurement of military support. We continue to fulfill our obligations to deliver 1 million units of artillery ammunition and missiles for Ukraine. Remember that we have developed the first, second and third paths for this purpose. The first tile envisaged the use of 1 billion euros to meet the most different needs of Ukraine. This work continues. I cannot give Valkretic figures, but more than 1000 rockets have already been provided to Ukraine, and the number of ammunition is increasing, although it should grow faster in the next days, ”Borrel said.</p>
<p>He noted that the second way of providing Ukraine with ammunition, which preceded the joint order by countries <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz"></a>The production of artillery ammunition at the defense industry enterprises is still in need of a joint decision, although the allocation for such targets for another billion euros has already been agreed at the EU level.</p>
<p>"In this(The second path - ed.)There are some differences, but we continue to work. We do not look forward to forming a legal document. The work is fully ready, until such a legal document is completed. The third way is to increase the capacity of our defense industry. My friend(European Commissar - Ed.)Tieri Breton will soon be presented with specific proposals for increasing defense production. For this, we will need to use what we have, but we have a multifaceted one, ”the high representative of the EU emphasized.</p>
<p>He also reminded that the military auxiliary mission of Ukraine, with the help of which more than 16 thousand Ukrainian servicemen have already undergone a training, continues to work, so the EU fulfills its obligation to provide a training for 30,000 military specialists by the end of the year.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3700110-sob-visuvati-mirni-propozicii-spocatku-potribno-vidvidati-ukrainu-borrel.html"><strong> Borrel </strong></a>As reported, the EU Council of Ministers of Ukraine was in Luxembourg today, the main topics of which were: discussing further assistance to Ukraine, in particular, the urgent delivery of ammunition to counteract Russian aggression, the development of the situation in Sudan, as well as to clarify the strategy of development of development between the EU and China.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, she stated this at open debate in Radbeza Postpreda UK at Oonbarbar Woodward.</p>
<p>“We saw what the Russian idea of multilaterality means for the world. For more than a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine, President Putin brought this Ukraine unimaginable suffering by trampling the UN Statute. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, millions were forced to leave their homes, and billions of people around the world have grown up with a rapid increase in prices for raw materials and brackets, ”she said.</p>
<p>According to Woodward, the war has also become a real catastrophe for Russia itself, which suffered numerous human losses. Millions flee from the country to avoid a prize, freedom of speech is suppressed, Russia's economy is declining, noted.</p>
<p>"Her army is in a disorder, relying on Wagner - a non -reporting group, whose existence was denied a year ago, but who now issues the advisory foreign ministry during your prescription," she said, addressing Lavrov.</p>

<p>According to her, if Lavrov is interested in ending the conflict as soon as possible, Russia should immediately withdraw its troops from all over the Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, he stated this at a meeting of the UN Security Council, organized by Russia, on "Effective Multilaterality by Protecting the Principles of the UN Charter".</p>
<p>“In organizing these debates, Russia tries to present itself as a protector of the multilaterality assigned to the UN Charter. Nothing can be further distinguished. If Russia was indeed interested in the topic of today's order, it ceased to violate the UN Charter, international law and immediately withdrawing all its troops from all over Ukraine, ”reading a statement on behalf of the EU countries.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/golovna-49.jpg" />The Center for Studies of the Military History of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the occasion of the 103rd anniversary of the Warsaw Treaty between Ukraine and Poland in 1920 presented a new exhibition project "Union of White Eagle and Golden Trizub". He tells in detail the military assistance provided by the Poles more than a hundred years ago, as well as the help that is now provided during the Russian-Ukrainian War.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poland and Ukraine have part of a common history. At this time, we want modern citizens of our countries to remember what connects us, - said the Director of the Polish Institute, Advisor to the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine Robertchizhevsky.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/img_0222.jpg" />It is worth noting that the history of Ukrainian-Polish relations has a rich and saturated fire. The Poles and Ukrainians are not uncommon to unite. Especially if it went from the original enemy - Muscovy. And one prudent pages of mutual history are the conclusion of a political law between the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Republic of Poland on April 21, 1920.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_0273.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/img_0273-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_0262.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/img_0262-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_0270.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T93-00-00-04-00/img_0270-150x150.jpg" /></a>It was part of the Military Convention, which laid down the fundamental Polish-Ukrainian military action against the Bolshevik troops of Ukraine. The importance of these and subsequent allied initiatives can be completely characterized by the words of Jerzy Gedroyts, a well -known Polish publicist, politician and public figure: "There is no independent Poland of inadvertent Ukraine."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was here in Kiev that joint hostilities with the participation of the UNR Army of Ipol soldiers against the Bolshevik authorities took place. As in 1920, a common enemy, a Russian aggressor, united the efforts of two neighboring peoples in our time. We see the sufferer that Poland is the most powerful lobbyist of Ukraine. It provides logistics support for Ukraine, assists weapons and equipment, has become a refuge of more than 3 million Ukrainians, - says Colonel Igor Kosyak, Head of the Center for Military History.Knowing the price of Russian occupation, Ukraine and Poland are doing everything to prevent the repetition of the events of 1920 and 2022. And from the beginning of the large -scale intensification of Russia, Poland has taken a clear pro -Ukrainian position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe then in 1920 we did not win, but now our union is much more. After all, Ukraine enlisted the support of most countries of the world. And we will necessarily win. We continue to create a new Europe together. And this Europe will be released due to the courage and courage of Ukrainians, - said Volodymyr Tilishchak, Deputy Chairman of Ukrainian Institute of National Memory.</p>
