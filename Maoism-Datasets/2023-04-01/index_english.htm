<p><a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9144"></a>_ <strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.</p>
<p>These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.</p>
<p>The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what awaits everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.</p>
<p>By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.</p>
<p>This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.</p>
<p>Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.</p>
<p>He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.</p>
<p>In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.</p>
<p>This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.</p>
<p>Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.</p>
<p>I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child - a five -month -old man, he was called Danilo. From Avdiivka, in the Donbass, with his parents. Parents. Russian artillery ... One of the hundreds of artillery shelling, as a terrorist-terrorist, performs daily.</p>
<p>And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...</p>
<p>There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such cause that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.</p>
<p>Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.</p>
<p>Glory to all who are in battle now!</p>
<p>I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!</p>
<p>_<strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong> _</p>

<p>This was stated by the Prime Minister of Mateusz Moravetsky at the plant in Semianovitsa-Schlonsky, which produces this equipment, Ukrinform reports with reference to <a href="https://www.polskieradio.pl/398/7856/Artykul/3144320,%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0-%D1%83-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%89%D1%96-100-%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B2-rosomak"></a>.</p>

<p>In his opinion, Rosomak armored personnel carriers, like Kraba howitzers, become a national export brand of the Polish weapons, now Poland has negotiated their sale with other countries. Moravetsky noted that the equipment - near Krab - "is the pride of the Polish defense industry."</p>
<p>According to the Head of Government, the plant in Semyanovitsa-Schlonsky can produce a number of 100 Rosomak a year.</p>

<p>“It is known that the armament of the army requires three things - money, money and evenly. The Polish budget guarantees the stability of expenditures and investments in the Vpol defense industry. It is very important to remember. Because the one who is forgiven will once be forced to invest in someone else's. And we do not want it, ”Moravetsky said.</p>
<p>As it was reported, Poland is in favor of an increase in the European Peace Fund, and the acquisition of weapons for Ukraine is funded.</p>

<p><a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9144"></a>_ <strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.</p>
<p>These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.</p>
<p>The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what awaits everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.</p>
<p>By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.</p>
<p>This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.</p>
<p>Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.</p>
<p>He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.</p>
<p>In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.</p>
<p>This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.</p>
<p>Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.</p>
<p>I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child - a five -month -old man, he was called Danilo. From Avdiivka, in the Donbass, with his parents. Parents. Russian artillery ... One of the hundreds of artillery shelling, as a terrorist-terrorist, performs daily.</p>
<p>And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...</p>
<p>There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such cause that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.</p>
<p>Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.</p>
<p>Glory to all who are in battle now!</p>
<p>I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!</p>
<p>_<strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong> _</p>

<p>About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/605">wrote</a>In Telegram:</p>
<p>“Finally, since 2014, Ukraine has raised a rigid and legally competent question of the correspondence of the Russian Federation for the war.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the Buchan Summit of Faces of Justice, dedicated to the discussion of the prosecution of the aggressor state to the comprehensive responsibility of the Ukrainian people and humanity, President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky clearly expressed our state position on this issue.</p>
<p>Three levels of court proceedings are the National, International Criminal Court of Ispets tribunal.</p>
<p>And most importantly, the responsibility of the Russian Federation should be carried out primarily for aggression - as an primary crime.</p>
<p>After all, the main crime committed by the Russian Federation since 2014 is the crime of aggression(Domestic - war).</p>
<p>А воєнні злочини, злочини проти людяності, геноцид — похідні наразі.</p>
<p>На жаль, попереднє керівництво України займало непробачно м‘яку позицію щодопритягнення РФ до відповідальності і взагалі не подало нікуди жодного позовучи заяви щодо вчинення РФ саме агресії.</p>
<p>Влада і сама не називала це війною (ATO, OOS)Therefore, we were limited to the statements of the international institutions only on terrorism and war crimes.</p>
<p>In the end, we just spent a few years. And for the investigation of crimes - the cyinodes are fatal.</p>
<p>The requirement of Ukraine to create a special priorbun on the crime of aggression of the Russian Federation is a very strong position. Very!</p>
<p>Because since the Nuremberg process, international courts have no longer expelled for aggression.</p>
<p>Only for the derivative of her crimes.</p>
<p>International law and international courts work so poor.</p>
<p>Of course, there has never been enough international political consolidation, and there is a always war.</p>
<p>The only thing that was done since 2014 was the forces of brave Ukrainian judges to build 17 sentences for aggression within national justice.</p>
<p>The brave - because legally there was an ATO, and they wrote in the sentences - "aggression" was properly qualified.</p>
<p>At that time, I taught the qualification of crimes in the National School of Judges in zoning actions and was relevant to the development of this approach - how to qualify RFSAM actions under Article 437 of the Criminal Code "Planning, preparation, solving and maintaining an aggressive war".</p>
<p>I remember how many debates in the legal community that could not be contrary to the approaches of international humanitarian law that the subject of the crime is not.Moreover, our judges then made incredible and documented even information operations as one of the signs of war.</p>
<p>And finally, it is not a separate position of bold judges, but a clear and rigid state position of Ukraine.</p>
<p>It's a difficult way. But now he will show well - whether the world is ready to consolidate and punish wars for them. "</p>

It shows the cruelty of the invaders and the destruction they bring. All exhibitors were collected just a few weeks before its opening.</p>
<p>She impressed the Ukrainians and guests of the country. And now it was opened in New York as a meters from the UN. The exhibits are presented on the eve of the UN consideration by the issue of an international tribunal, which will punish Russia for the crimes of aggression.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-01T72-00-00-04-00/dsc01529.jpg" />-It was important for us that the society would see the consequences of occupation, what the dog is "Russian measure",-says Sergey Sudinovich, an employee of the National Museum of Ukrainian History in the Second World War, the Museum of War of the Motherland. —All, on May 8, 2022, we opened an exhibition "Ukraine-Crucifixion" in Ukraine. The expeditions of the museum staff were organized to the liberated points-Irpen, Bucha, Borodyanka, Makarov, Gostomel, etc. The Russians left many personal belongings, shoes, broken equipment, ammunition, dry -ups ...

However, this is the truth of today. Therefore, the fact that the exhibition is shown abroad is extremely important.</p>
<p>One of the key exhibits was the exact copy of the bomb shelter in Gostomel, and many locals, including children, were devoured. Thanks to the authentic vents, the atmosphere was restored as accurately as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>The diary of the Russian officer, who was found in the Selizhatuzhanka, is also striking. The occupier left him on the table of a local school. There are things such as the cartouchery of Kiev, an icon in which the fragment of a Russian mine is stuck.</li>

I see the chaplains that have been working since 2014. But we live in reality. We have a new Ukrainian legislation, according to which a chaplain is a Jewish serviceman. Therefore, you all have to get the appropriate military rank. You, Ukrainian military chaplains, are a spiritual shield and protection of our military service. You must inspire hope and love in the soul of our warriors. Once on God, faith in God, as well as faith in our common victory, because we are struggling and striving to have our own independent, united, democratic Tai -European Ukraine. We have chosen this development vector for which we now pay a very high price. After all, every day we put human lives on the altar of our residency. The lives of our soldiers, peaceful inhabitants and children. Therefore, I wish the Lord inspired you, gave strength and patience to take care of the warriors, - said Epiphanius.</li>

<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/sogodni-derzhava-terorist-pochala-golovuvati-v-radbezi-oon-v-82025">said</a>During his video address:</p>
<p>“I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</p>
<p>He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.</p>
<p>These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.</p>
<p>The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.</p>
<p>Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what expects everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.</p>
<p>By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.</p>
<p>This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.</p>
<p>Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.</p>
<p>He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.</p>
<p>In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.</p>
<p>This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.</p>
<p>Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.</p>
<p>I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.</p>
<p>I thank Croatia for the next military support package. I thank the Northern Management for the decisions on helicopters. Slovakia, Slovenia.</p>
<p>I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...</p>
<p>There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such reason that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.</p>
<p>Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.</p>
<p>Glory to all who are in battle now!</p>
<p>I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!"</p>
