Similar provocations are a form of enemy IPSO. Under the cover of a humane goal, they are really called to duplicate the work of international organizations that the aggressor country does not allow the places of keeping prisoners and civilian hostages, and the deported children.

We urge the Russian side to fulfill the Geneva Conventions, to ensure the refined and complete access of representatives of the International Committee of the Chervonoro -Rrest to the places of detention, not to engage in pseudo -initiatives for the purpose of propaganda.

У зв'язку з цим у Генштабі наводять слова головного маршала авіаціїКоролівських Повітряних сил сера Майка Вігстона. "Україна є життєво важливимвипробуванням нашої спільної рішучості протистояти неспровокованомузалякуванню та агресії.

Віддаючи належне надзвичайній стійкості українських сил та використанню нимиповітряно-космічної техніки, сер Вігстон зазначив, що це різко контрастує зросійськими агресорами, яким непосильно зберегти повітряний контроль, поприперевагу технологій і ресурсів. Він констатував, що неспроможність інвестуватиу своїх людей призвела до того, що російські сили втратили переваги у війні,які можна здобути лише шляхом інтенсивної роботи та навчання з партнерами.

[](https://t.me/OP_UA/9144)_ ** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!** _

He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.

These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.

The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.

Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what awaits everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.

By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.

This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.

Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.

He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.

In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.

Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.

This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.

Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.

I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.

I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.

Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.

Yesterday, the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child - a five -month -old man, he was called Danilo. From Avdiivka, in the Donbass, with his parents. Parents. Russian artillery ... One of the hundreds of artillery shelling, as a terrorist-terrorist, performs daily.

And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.

It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...

There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such cause that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.

Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.

Glory to all who are in battle now!

I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!

Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

“It is known that the armament of the army requires three things - money, money and evenly. The Polish budget guarantees the stability of expenditures and investments in the Vpol defense industry. It is very important to remember. Because the one who is forgiven will once be forced to invest in someone else's. And we do not want it, ”Moravetsky said.

[](https://t.me/OP_UA/9144)_ ** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!** _

He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.

These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.

The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.

Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what awaits everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.

By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.

This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.

Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.

He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.

In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.

Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.

This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.

Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.

I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.

I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.

Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.

Yesterday, the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child - a five -month -old man, he was called Danilo. From Avdiivka, in the Donbass, with his parents. Parents. Russian artillery ... One of the hundreds of artillery shelling, as a terrorist-terrorist, performs daily.

And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.

It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...

There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such cause that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.

Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.

Glory to all who are in battle now!

I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!

Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar [wrote](https://t.me/annamaliar/605)In Telegram:

“Finally, since 2014, Ukraine has raised a rigid and legally competent question of the correspondence of the Russian Federation for the war.

Yesterday, during the Buchan Summit of Faces of Justice, dedicated to the discussion of the prosecution of the aggressor state to the comprehensive responsibility of the Ukrainian people and humanity, President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky clearly expressed our state position on this issue.

Three levels of court proceedings are the National, International Criminal Court of Ispets tribunal.

And most importantly, the responsibility of the Russian Federation should be carried out primarily for aggression - as an primary crime.

After all, the main crime committed by the Russian Federation since 2014 is the crime of aggression(Domestic - war).

А воєнні злочини, злочини проти людяності, геноцид — похідні наразі.

На жаль, попереднє керівництво України займало непробачно м‘яку позицію щодопритягнення РФ до відповідальності і взагалі не подало нікуди жодного позовучи заяви щодо вчинення РФ саме агресії.

Влада і сама не називала це війною (ATO, OOS)Therefore, we were limited to the statements of the international institutions only on terrorism and war crimes.

In the end, we just spent a few years. And for the investigation of crimes - the cyinodes are fatal.

The requirement of Ukraine to create a special priorbun on the crime of aggression of the Russian Federation is a very strong position. Very!

Because since the Nuremberg process, international courts have no longer expelled for aggression.

Only for the derivative of her crimes.

International law and international courts work so poor.

Of course, there has never been enough international political consolidation, and there is a always war.

The only thing that was done since 2014 was the forces of brave Ukrainian judges to build 17 sentences for aggression within national justice.

The brave - because legally there was an ATO, and they wrote in the sentences - "aggression" was properly qualified.

At that time, I taught the qualification of crimes in the National School of Judges in zoning actions and was relevant to the development of this approach - how to qualify RFSAM actions under Article 437 of the Criminal Code "Planning, preparation, solving and maintaining an aggressive war".

I remember how many debates in the legal community that could not be contrary to the approaches of international humanitarian law that the subject of the crime is not.Moreover, our judges then made incredible and documented even information operations as one of the signs of war.

And finally, it is not a separate position of bold judges, but a clear and rigid state position of Ukraine.

It's a difficult way. But now he will show well - whether the world is ready to consolidate and punish wars for them. "

Once on God, faith in God, as well as faith in our common victory, because we are struggling and striving to have our own independent, united, democratic Tai -European Ukraine. We have chosen this development vector for which we now pay a very high price. After all, every day we put human lives on the altar of our residency. The lives of our soldiers, peaceful inhabitants and children. Therefore, I wish the Lord inspired you, gave strength and patience to take care of the warriors, - said Epiphanius.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/sogodni-derzhava-terorist-pochala-golovuvati-v-radbezi-oon-v-82025)During his video address:

“I wish health, dear Ukrainians!

He signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression.

These are officials of the aggressor state, its MIC-hundreds of companies-and collaborators. There is more than 650 new sanctions.

The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists work, supplies or produces weapons for terror - none of the responsibility.

Blocking of terror accomplices, isolation of a terrorist state, its defeat and judicial processes are what expects everyone who has begun and wages a war against Ukraine in international order.

By the way, this week, Switzerland joined the tenth sanction packet.

This is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense, they still take a clear moral position to Russian terror, to the destruction of the Rosiyglobal Order based on the rules.

Only in unity can we maintain peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Veszerland for the relevant decisions.

He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron today. Very detailed, an hour. About the situation on the front, about our interaction political, about how we peace in the implementation of the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank France for unchanged support.

In general, the week has given a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our protection to protect the normal life of all free nations.

Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report began to be administered by the violent deportation of Russian children and attempts to be abused by our children.

This crime of Russia is one of the most cynical and anti -human crimes of our time.

Russia commits it systematically and calculated, at the state level. Systemic will be responsible for him. Responsibility of Russia as the state and all who are involved.

I thank Germany for the new steps in the defensive support that have been made this week.

I thank Croatia for the next military support package. I thank the Northern Management for the decisions on helicopters. Slovakia, Slovenia.

I thank Canada for financial support, the funds have already been received from the state budget of Ukraine.

I thank the IMF for the new program for Ukraine. The program has been approved. The volume is more than 15 billion. This will help us to protect social stability.

Unfortunately, we also have the news obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state has begun to preserve the UN Security Council.And at the same time Russia presides in the UN Security Council.

It is difficult to imagine something that proves more fully bankruptcy of such institutions ...

There is no such form of terror that is not yet made by Russia. And there will be no such reason that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular the UN Security Council, which is obviously ripe-that the terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist could not destroy peace.

Terrorists must lose, should be responsible for terror, not presented anywhere.

Glory to all who are in battle now!

I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who protects the international order based on the rules!Thank you all who save and help save our people after wounds from Russian shelling!

Eternal memory of all adults and children whose lives have taken away terror of Russia!

Glory to Ukraine!"
