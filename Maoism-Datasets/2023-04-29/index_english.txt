 _ Dear Ukrainians!_ 
Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...
To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave - is provided with the necessary help. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.
The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.
Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...
Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it were not that the terrorist state would have been able to pick up much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.
Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.
I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.
I outlined my partners what prospects we have on the battlefield now and what kind of help we need to go all this necessary path. I have informed what we do to realize our formula of peace, in particular the Ipoonnt on the prosecution of the perpetrators. Thank you that the Slavonic and the Czech Republic, equally with us, see the need to restore justice to the hypocrisy of war criminals, to punish all these terrorists.
They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.
Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.
Today, however, a significant investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.
I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!
_ Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, at combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine! _
Glory to Ukraine!
