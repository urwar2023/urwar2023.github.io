 This was stated by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg during the announcement of joint statements with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken at the US State Department.
On June 12-13, a visit to Jes Stoltenberg to the United States was made, in which the leader of the novice Atlantic Alliance discussed in Washington the issue of the future summit in Vilnius.
NATO Secretary General has praised the support of allies on the Alliance to strengthen Ukraine's compliance in counteracting Russian aggression.
“I want to thank the United States and President Biden for everything you do to strengthen the transatlantic ties. And, of course, the support you perch Ukraine. European allies also contribute to Ukraine, tens of billions of economic and military support.
The support of NATO allies and partners is changing the situation on the battlefield as Ukrainian Ukrainians have launched an offensive. They move and conquer positions. We know that the more Ukrainians are ready to release the land, the stronger they will be during the negotiations. And it is more likely that President Putin will realize that he will never win the invading war on the battlefield, ”Yinstoltenberg stressed.
On February 24, 2022, the large -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine replaced NATO on February 24, 2022. Alliance countries have begun to spend more on defense, strengthening security in the Euro -Atlantic region.
Even the share of 2% of GDP for defense, which was announced at the NATO summit in Walesiu in 2014 is not enough to effectively counteract modern threats, says Jens Stoltenberg. It was planned that by 2024 the countries would not spend a minimum of 2% on defense costs.
“We are preparing for the next NATO summit in Vilnius. There we will agree to increase and strengthen support for Ukraine, then strengthen our nuclear restraint and defense, which includes clearer obligations to increase defense costs.
I expect that the Alliance members agree that 2% of GDP should be a minimum and that the Mipovin is all investing in our defense and collective security, ”Yinstoltenberg summarized.

 The appearance of the "interpretations" of the map of Ukraine by Russia and a number of well -known -headed brands causes a split in the public perception of Europeans, and it must be combated at the state level.
This was discussed at meeting round table in Ukrinform on "Territorial integrity VS Cartographic propaganda".
A representative of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security Maximayorov noted that after occupation by Russia, part of the territory of Ukraine appeared cards, on which they were not marked as Ukrainian territories. Moreover, they will be supplied by large international publications and companies whose governments support Ukraine's territorial integrity.
“Initially, these were outlines, that is, contours, maps of Ukraine on the Internet, VmassMedia, in electronic publications, on television. Subsequently, in the West, these territories were not denoted in the West in accordance with the position of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but as the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but as the territorial integrity of Ukraine, or controversial or uncertain, ”he said.
The founder of the public initiative "STOP MAPAGANDA!Information de -occupation of Ukraine ”Mykola Golubey noted that not only Russia is engaged in Mapoganda, but among large Western brands are those that print and spread it.
“For example, National Geographic allegedly only depicts geographical controversy, but ... in the flagship atlas of National Geographic, there is an order that Crimea is part. At the end of the atlas there is also additional material about it, ”Golubey said.
He explained that so soft propaganda , placed in printed products of well -known brands, is perceived as a fact.
"The result of" Mapogangs "is that due to the large number of interpretations of Ukraine, there is a split in the public perception of Europeans," the founder of the public initiative.
According to him, the consequences of such influence include counteraction to decision -making governments on the supply of weapons for Ukraine, promotion of the idea of "cutting" of Ukraine, as well as motivation of citizens to violate the border crossing.
“The seizure of the territory, or occupation, or annexation is not a reason to change the state border. Therefore, in such cases, we cannot transfer the state border. The state border ... must be shown(So)as it is recorded in accordance with the international treaty, but it should be made that it is a temporarily occupied territory and, of course, about the ownership of DUNMENT, ”Sossa stressed.
He also noted that there is a concept of border delimitation, the border line of the map, and demarcation, that is, taking this line to the terrain. According to its words, in Ukraine with Russia the land plot of the border is only delimited. “Cybots were completed in 2003. In 2006, even the Decree of the President of Ukraine was established a demarcation commission. But the Russian side was ignored, did not create any commissions, and the demarcation of the border landowner was not carried out. The same story with delimitation in the aquatoria and the Black Seas, ”the scientist added.
Read also: Foreign Ministry contributed to the correction of 20 cases of incorrect imposition of borders of Ukraine According to the founder of the public initiative "STOP MAPAGANDA!Information Production of Ukraine ”, the task of the state should be to consolidate in the minds of the Ukrainian ideas that the only borders of Ukraine are determined as of 1991, and the only image of the map of Ukraine is the official image of the UN. He also called the stages of this work.
“It is first and foremost to stop the sale of fake products, to conduct investigations within companies or to change the policy of companies. Official letters from companies with recognition of fake products, as well as compulsory funding by companies by violators of measures of Ukraine, depending on the information damage they caused, ”said Golubey.

 The procedure of procurement of food for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is open and compliance with all procedures. Anyone can track it on the website.
About it reports Ministry of Defence Ukraine.
At the same time, on June 12, several people spread unreliable and incorrect information on the purchase of food of the Ministry of Defense.
Therefore, as for "not publishing information on which, allegedly, the collegial body made a decision on Friday, June 9", then the collegial organ of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Defense Procurement, and by the way, there is a representative of the Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense Ministry , On June 9, he made only a decision to reject participants in some procedures, which MUS immediately published in the electronic system of ProZorro on June 9.
The decision to recognize the winners was transferred by the collegial body to June 12, after which IUU on the same day - June 12 - immediately published them by the ProZorro procurement system. It is about 8 procurement procedures. This information is open. In addition, on June 13, another 8 procedures were announced and winners.
In total, the Ministry of Defense has announced 22 procedures for the purchase of food for the Armed Forces. Currently, 16 of them have results and the winners have been announced. The winners have not yet been determined by 4 processes; Another 2 procedures were rejected by all times, and on June 13, these 2 procedures were repeated.
“Unfortunately, people who have distributed information that the publications of trading are not being delayed and not published. These "data" is not true. This is easily checked both in the ProZorro system, so it is idle at the expense of public control - a representative of the anti -correal counterparts is a part of the collegial body of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement. Actually, information about this "fact" has already been deleted by authors from publications. What do we have in reality? Purchases are ongoing, everything happens to all procedures and without violation of no terms, which are defined by the Law on Public Procurement, - said Deputy Minister of Defense Denisssharapov.In addition, during the period of clarifications from the participants for each procedure, a secondary average of 40 appeals - that is, 22 procedures more than 850 appeals. The Ministry of Defense is obliged to publish appropriate explanations within one working day from the date of receipt of the receipt.
“Given that all this could have caused the disruption of the personal composition, the MOU took into account these risks and proposed the corresponding changes to the CMUN335 resolution. Important: These changes did not oblige the MOU to continue the current agreements of the year, but only gave the right to amend the time, sufficient for the procurement procedure. We cannot allow our military to eat. The reaction to such threats is obvious - it is impossible to make a lot of inspection on the nutrition of military unscrupulous participants. Currently, the post -publication of the results of bidding, that is, when we are sure that the auction has taken place, that there will be no disruption of food supplies to our defenders and rags, we have applied to leave these changes without consideration without consideration, ”Denis Sharapov added.

In addition, the perpetrators of this crime should be held accountable, and Ukraine should hold even more weapons to win the war and release their territories.
His one -party officer Jurgen Trittin called the blasting of the dams another crime, Inagada was that it was Russia's first attack on a hydraulic company. "We have to put the end of the statement of avoiding responsibility," he urged. What happened, the expected deficit of grain, should be a signal for all those who say, "This is a non -war."
"We condemn this way of warfare. It is clear to us that Ukraine's support in this new dimension is more urgent than ever. We continue to help Ukraine, including weapons, ”said Niels Schmid, a representative of the ruling social -democratic party. He advocated the recognition of an ecocid during the war criminal offense in international criminal law, there is no need to be persecuted as a military crime.

«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».
Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:
«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».
Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:
«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».
Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.
«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.
Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.

 Step by step demining the State Special Defense Transport Service of Ukraine cleans their native land from artillery shells, various mines, aviation and other explosive "gifts" left by Russian invaders during retreat.

 After the de -occupation, the process of restoring the destroyed infrastructure began. One stages of which was the restoration of movement across the River of Zherev, which divides the village of Slazvrav and Zherevpillya. At all stages of the builders are accompanied by changes of variations, including representatives of the State Special Transport Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
The State Special Transport Service is a specialized military formation, which is part of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, intended to ensure the sustainable functioning of transport in peacetime and in a special period.

 - We are not working on this facility for the first time. The first time they cleared the territory in the beginning of the construction of the temporary bridge. Now the builders have come to the erection of a new bridge. During the work, they found ammunition that were detonated, and called our group to mine the construction site,-says the commander of the engineering-sapper group of DSST Alexander Prizhikov. - It is very difficult to work in this area, because the soil remains the same concrete elements of the structure of the old bridge, which significantly complicates the use of the ministry.
Of course, the sappers of the State Support Service were not only demining the adjacent destroyed bridge of the territory. The local residents asked the military to inspect the land and other territories near the village, and they were never denied.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T66-00-00-04-00/dsst_09-150x150.jpg) 
 The sappers argue that the land around the bridge hides many "orkivski-surprises", because during the blasting of the structure, the Russians used an unsecuted amount of ammunition, namely, anti-tank mines TM-62 and 82-mmminometric mines. The use of so many ammunition can only be explained that the invaders needed to release a place for washing machines that they selected from local residents.

 In total, 22 explosive objects were identified and disposed of this time, including three anti-tank mines of TM-62 and nineteen mortar mines. Due to the fact that the detected ammunition cannot be transported, the sappers decided to destroy them on the spot.

 The parliamentary parliament was sentenced to blast the dams of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, the fault for which the fair majority of the Bundestag members put on Russia and demands the punishment of responsible ones.
The situation was discussed on Wednesday, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
The deputy from the Union of the Union of 90- "Green" Robin Vagain called the conscious blasting of the dam "the most terrible man-made disaster, which has been in recent decades." Tens of thousands of people were in the area of disaster, and from left to the shore the invaders also hindered evacuation. Water supply has been affected for 700,000 Ukrainians, the World Health Organization prevents cholera burning, and the crop reduction will be felt in many corners of the world. "Intention of nature is nothing more than an ecocid," the politician emphasized.
He also spoke for emergency emergency assistance to Ukraine and assistance to the reconstruction, as well as support on the EU's journey to Ukraine. In addition, the perpetrators of this crime should be held accountable, and Ukraine should hold even more weapons to win the war and release their territories.
His one -party officer Jurgen Trittin called the blasting of the dams another crime, Inagada was that it was Russia's first attack on a hydraulic company. "We have to put the end of the statement of avoiding responsibility," he urged. What happened, the expected deficit of grain, should be a signal for all those who say, "This is a non -war."
"We condemn this way of warfare. It is clear to us that Ukraine's support in this new dimension is more urgent than ever. We continue to help Ukraine, including weapons, ”said Niels Schmid, a representative of the ruling social -democratic party. He advocated the recognition of an ecocid during the war criminal offense in international criminal law, there is no need to be persecuted as a military crime. Schmidta also emphasized the need to pay more attention to the safety of such sensitive objects as nuclear power plants.

He should be responsible for this in the Hague, ”she said, and Putin said that Putin with her imperial ambitions and the desire to make Ukraine to close her way to the West," will not be able to prevent this even with the help of 80 billion liters of water.

Yes, Johann David Vadeful called the destruction of the dam "crime against humanity", as a crime against plants and animals. "To ensure that such catastrophes are unique, the German government must support Ukraine so quickly and so vigorously that it can win this war," Vadeful said. His one -party officer Knutabrags noted that the fact that Russia is successful in showing its weakness. “Russia acts as a terrorist country. It is a war crime, it is terror, ”he said.
Left and right “alternative for Germany "On the one hand, they expressed their condolences to the victims, but they were also insisting on the cessation of supply of weapons to Ukraine, which, they say, did not contribute to the war, but only leads to escalation. The left demand the ceasefire of the negotiations, although they speak of "a crime that is not justified", the lawyers "do not know" who is guilty of blasting the dams.
We will remind, the dam on the Dnieper in the south of Ukraine was destroyed by Russian ones June 6.

Poland quite realistically perceives the need for Ukraine's membership in NATO. And this objective need. Together, we develop a specific content for the Vilnius Alliance summit.

And we do everything to our vision, the Ukrainian vision - as always, meaningful - the appropriate level of international arrangements has been prepared.
We continue our communication with partners on Russian rocket production. Today, Russian inhumans have inflicted on another rocket launcher in the Odessa - from "calibers". Dozens of components of these "calibers" are placed in Russia. Obviously, every such path of supply is the way to strengthen the terror. The world has tools to block all such paths - from each country, from every company whose components are used by Russian missiles.Please, always remember that we are all obliged in Ukraine to protect our people's lives and independence. Respect for our military, respect for our relatives of our soldiers, respect for the wives and men of all those who stood up for the state is certainly. Thanks to these people is a good thing.
