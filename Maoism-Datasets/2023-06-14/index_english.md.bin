On June 12-13, a visit to Jes Stoltenberg to the United States was made, in which the leader of the novice Atlantic Alliance discussed in Washington the issue of the future summit in Vilnius.

NATO Secretary General has praised the support of allies on the Alliance to strengthen Ukraine's compliance in counteracting Russian aggression.

“I want to thank the United States and President Biden for everything you do to strengthen the transatlantic ties. And, of course, the support you perch Ukraine. European allies also contribute to Ukraine, tens of billions of economic and military support.

The support of NATO allies and partners is changing the situation on the battlefield as Ukrainian Ukrainians have launched an offensive. They move and conquer positions. We know that the more Ukrainians are ready to release the land, the stronger they will be during the negotiations. And it is more likely that President Putin will realize that he will never win the invading war on the battlefield, ”Yinstoltenberg stressed.

On February 24, 2022, the large -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine replaced NATO on February 24, 2022. Alliance countries have begun to spend more on defense, strengthening security in the Euro -Atlantic region.

Even the share of 2% of GDP for defense, which was announced at the NATO summit in Walesiu in 2014 is not enough to effectively counteract modern threats, says Jens Stoltenberg. It was planned that by 2024 the countries would not spend a minimum of 2% on defense costs.

“We are preparing for the next NATO summit in Vilnius. There we will agree to increase and strengthen support for Ukraine, then strengthen our nuclear restraint and defense, which includes clearer obligations to increase defense costs.

I expect that the Alliance members agree that 2% of GDP should be a minimum and that the Mipovin is all investing in our defense and collective security, ”Yinstoltenberg summarized.

Secondly, it is a way of sowing among Ukrainians and igniting the rage of state bodies and power in general.

According to him, none of the analysts will be taken to evaluate what and how to do when active fighting is underway in the territory of the Zaporozhye region and a sudden reactor or a storage facility of the waste nuclear fuel.

The external, is convinced that the catastrophe on the Kakhovsky hydroelectric power station is the forerunner, which can take place at a much larger and more terrible scale.

"I would recommend to the highest Ukrainian leadership to sit down and negotiate with the event to prevent the most terrifying scenario for the ZPP. Adzheal of tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus - these are quite theoretical threats for NATO safety and the beginning of nuclear war. that now Ukrainian troops continue the offensive for the purpose of liberation of both Zaporizhzhya region and Energodar - becomes the nuclear danger of numbers not only for Ukraine, but for the whole world, "the expireowner said.

According to Ukrinform, it reports [The New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/arts/john-romita-sr-dead.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)His son, John Romita younger, reported the death of the illustrator. He said his father died in a dream on Monday.

“Millions have learned [marvel](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-komiks-marvel)Thanks to his art, and millions have learned Peter Parker(Spider-Man-Ed.)Thanks to the unmistakable bold drawing, which Romita brought to his pages. We have lost one of our legends, and we are mourning the loss of the creative giant, ”Marvel said in a statement.

John Romita was born on January 24, 1930 in Brooklyn and was a senior of five children in the family.

He began his career as a commercial artist Romita in 1947. Meeting with a former -moutian who worked on Stan Lee, the editor -in -chief of Marvel Comics - led him to the first success. The artist began to secretly draw the comics of the oilseed, who later blocked them in ink and gave them for his own work.

The direct cooperation of Romite with Lee began in the 1950s. The artist's career development began in 1966 during his work on the comic book "Amazing Spider-Man", which as a result became one of his most famous works.

Romita retired in 1996, but continued to work on certain projections for Marvel and DC.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-14T18-00-31-03-00/630_360_1686754380-955.jpg)The appearance of the "interpretations" of the map of Ukraine by Russia and a number of well -known -headed brands causes a split in the public perception of Europeans, and it must be combated at the state level.

This was discussed at [meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csCVOIsOCLw)round table in Ukrinform on "Territorial integrity VS Cartographic propaganda".

A representative of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security Maximayorov noted that after occupation by Russia, part of the territory of Ukraine appeared cards, on which they were not marked as Ukrainian territories. Moreover, they will be supplied by large international publications and companies whose governments support Ukraine's territorial integrity.

“Initially, these were outlines, that is, contours, maps of Ukraine on the Internet, VmassMedia, in electronic publications, on television. Subsequently, in the West, these territories were not denoted in the West in accordance with the position of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but as the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but as the territorial integrity of Ukraine, or controversial or uncertain, ”he said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-14T18-00-31-03-00/1686754274-737.jpg)The founder of the public initiative "STOP MAPAGANDA!Information de -occupation of Ukraine ”Mykola Golubey noted that not only Russia is engaged in Mapoganda, but among large Western brands are those that print and spread it.

"Another thing is that the blocking of Hungary in the EU and NATO is not only the issue of the Hungarian national minority in Transcarpathia. Ukrainian -Hungarian relations are catastrophic already. And this is just an excuse for Hungary to block, play, do well to the Russians - let The opinion of Hungary on Sweden is also thought, because Sweden has no Hungarian minority, " - emphasizes Tuzhansky.

About it [reports](https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2023/06/13/rezultati-zakupivel-produktiv-harchuvannya-zsu-na-druge-pivrichchya-buli-oprilyudneni-v-sistemi-prozorro-12-13-chervnya/)Ministry of Defence Ukraine.

At the same time, on June 12, several people spread unreliable and incorrect information on the purchase of food of the Ministry of Defense.

Therefore, as for "not publishing information on which, allegedly, the collegial body made a decision on Friday, June 9", then the collegial organ of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Defense Procurement, and by the way, there is a representative of the Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense Ministry , On June 9, he made only a decision to reject participants in some procedures, which MUS immediately published in the electronic system of ProZorro on June 9.

The decision to recognize the winners was transferred by the collegial body to June 12, after which IUU on the same day - June 12 - immediately published them by the ProZorro procurement system. It is about 8 procurement procedures. This information is open. In addition, on June 13, another 8 procedures were announced and winners.

In total, the Ministry of Defense has announced 22 procedures for the purchase of food for the Armed Forces. Currently, 16 of them have results and the winners have been announced. The winners have not yet been determined by 4 processes; Another 2 procedures were rejected by all times, and on June 13, these 2 procedures were repeated.

“Unfortunately, people who have distributed information that the publications of trading are not being delayed and not published. These "data" is not true. This is easily checked both in the ProZorro system, so it is idle at the expense of public control - a representative of the anti -correal counterparts is a part of the collegial body of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement. Actually, information about this "fact" has already been deleted by authors from publications. What do we have in reality? Purchases are ongoing, everything happens to all procedures and without violation of no terms, which are defined by the Law on Public Procurement, - said Deputy Minister of Defense Denisssharapov.In addition, during the period of clarifications from the participants for each procedure, a secondary average of 40 appeals - that is, 22 procedures more than 850 appeals. The Ministry of Defense is obliged to publish appropriate explanations within one working day from the date of receipt of the receipt.

“Given that all this could have caused the disruption of the personal composition, the MOU took into account these risks and proposed the corresponding changes to the CMUN335 resolution. Important: These changes did not oblige the MOU to continue the current agreements of the year, but only gave the right to amend the time, sufficient for the procurement procedure. We cannot allow our military to eat. The reaction to such threats is obvious - it is impossible to make a lot of inspection on the nutrition of military unscrupulous participants. Currently, the post -publication of the results of bidding, that is, when we are sure that the auction has taken place, that there will be no disruption of food supplies to our defenders and rags, we have applied to leave these changes without consideration without consideration, ”Denis Sharapov added.

According to Ukrinform, Dmitrytrolubinets reports about it in [Facebook].(https://www.facebook.com/dmytro.lubinets/posts/pfbid0xbpFd7KV8TLzJ55iHJ8FEswbtqjLdTmp8BADk1TstBGKr4a3QWwrYbcrKigTxtYnl).

"Цивільні громадяни – це заручники. РФ повинна повернути їх без жодних умов, ане залучати в процес обміну військовополоненими!Наразі у Реєстрі зниклихбезвісти за особливих обставин з 24 лютого 2022 року – понад 25 тисячукраїнців.

"Civilians, civilians, should not be united at all, and if this happens, they must be released immediately!" - emphasized.

However, according to him, in Russia for everything, criminal motives. The Russian Federation is delayed citizens, because, first, it uses terror in relation to civilians, as a tool of influence on the position of Ukraine in the context of achieving military-political goals. The Russians understand that every civilian is released - a guide to how the Russian Federation has violated international rules. Secondly, it is a way of sowing among Ukrainians and igniting the rage of state bodies and power in general.

"In this context, a terrorist country uses a number of manipulative judgments. Unfortunately, most of them really affect Ukrainians. Among such assertions-" Ukraine refused to return their people "," Ukrainians are not going to return to their homeland "," Civil hostages are criminals "and criminals." Others, ”Lubinets said.

Ukraine is trying to at least a way to verify and return home to Ukrainian citizens.

"I see every comment and a call for the return of civilians. We are also constantly meeting the family whose relatives are in captivity. And on all sites we talk about civilian hostages, we demand that the world reaches the national fact that the fact is rigidly, to exclude pressure to exclude the Russian Federation from organizations, to exclude Russian Where this terrorist country has its voice, "Lubinets summed up.

- I would not want to be under his fire, - says Dmitry. He is a granatometer of the 2nd Mechanized Battalion of the 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Now his unit is fighting with the Russians in the east of the country.

The grenade launcher's firing position - in the forest a few hundred meters from the trench occupants. There is a calculation nearby in the armor. As soon as the infantrymen receive the command to open the fire - they run to their MK 19, dump branches, which are masked, aimed and "poured" by the queues of the departments.

- It doesn't have a day for a day, - says Dmitry. - Sometimes we can "peal" times a day. Sometimes-seven to eight times in half a day.

The enemy tries to destroy grenade launcher and grenade launchers. Therefore, they constantly change their positions and mask well.

- Recently, the artillery projectile fell literally 15 meters from us, - says Dmitry. - And he did not break. Soft sandy soil worked as aamortizer.

Despite the danger and difficult living conditions in the forest, Dmitry and its brothers radiate stability.

- This is the best work in the world. Forest, nature, birds, fresh air, the best, ”he laughs. - We have a lizard here. We called it Clava. And the two -in -law - Valera and Fedya. The boar runs. We have not yet called it because it is unpowered with us. Some kind of wild.

About it [reports](https://t.me/Koord_shtab)Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.

Representatives of the coordination headquarters, the Office of the Verkhovna Rada for Human Rights, the State Border Guard Service of the Tamzhizh International Committee of the Red Cross were answered by the loved ones.(ICCH).

Представник штабу запевнив, що робота зі звільнення прикордонників іЗахисників Зміїного ведеться щоденно:

«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».

Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:

«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».

Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:

«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».

Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.

«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.

Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.

The correspondent of the Armyinform witnessed one of the stages of demining nearby entertainment of the Vyshgorod district, in the Kyiv region.

- the Russian invaders occupied entertaining on March 15. Before entering the populated point, the Russians inflicted the air strike in the local hospital. As a result of this seven people were injured in varying degrees of gravity, four were killed, including two children, - said Valentina Strazhivsky District Studzhivsky district. - retreating, the invaders were blown up by the bridges. The explosion was such a force that in some houses the roofs were struck, the door and windows were knocked out. The fragments of the bridge and the ammunition laid down by the Russians.

One stages of which was the restoration of movement across the River of Zherev, which divides the village of Slazvrav and Zherevpillya. At all stages of the builders are accompanied by changes of variations, including representatives of the State Special Transport Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

The State Special Transport Service is a specialized military formation, which is part of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, intended to ensure the sustainable functioning of transport in peacetime and in a special period.

The first time they cleared the territory in the beginning of the construction of the temporary bridge. Now the builders have come to the erection of a new bridge. During the work, they found ammunition that were detonated, and called our group to mine the construction site,-says the commander of the engineering-sapper group of DSST Alexander Prizhikov. - It is very difficult to work in this area, because the soil remains the same concrete elements of the structure of the old bridge, which significantly complicates the use of the ministry.

Of course, the sappers of the State Support Service were not only demining the adjacent destroyed bridge of the territory. The local residents asked the military to inspect the land and other territories near the village, and they were never denied.

The use of so many ammunition can only be explained that the invaders needed to release a place for washing machines that they selected from local residents.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T69-00-00-04-00/zhytlo-dlya-v_sluzhbovcziv.jpeg)In the city of Kharkiv, persons with the status of combatants will be able to obtain a cost -free loan for a home for up to 15 years.

Such a norm is contained in the decision to amend the city target program of construction(acquisition)Available housing for 2021–2030, adopted on June 13 during an extraordinary session of Kharkiv City Council.

In this way, the deputies took care of our military and law enforcement officers who participated in the measures necessary to ensure the defense of Ukraine, protection of the security of the population and the interests of the state in connection with Russian aggression.

In addition, by voting, other changes have been made to this program, and will be able to remain in the queue to receive a preferential lever with the preservation of the order in the Register.

The initiators of these important decisions were a deputy group of numerous protectives of Ukraine, headed by a representative of the Kharkiv Regional Public Organization "Union of ATO Veterans" Yuri Korsunov.

- Social support for people who win or won victory for all Ukrainians is extremely needed, - says Yuri Korsunov. - There is a lot of such measures. We have long sought to make these changes be made. By the way, we also work on other important issues, including the provision of safety housing of our soldiers and families of dead brothers.

He said that on the basis of the last decision of the City Council the mechanism of providing interest -free loans is being worked out, specific housing facilities, state financial institutions and more are selected. Therefore, there is a little more to work on bringing this issue to the finish line. However, in his thought, the hardest thing is behind.

By the way, at the same time in Kharkiv region a regional program for supporting ATO/OOS participants for construction or purchase of housing in the Kharkiv region for 2022-2025 is being implemented. This social project, better known as "60%by 40%", stipulates that the participants of the program from the regional budget compensate for 40%of the cost of the home they buy. The rest of the money is paid by ATO/OOS. Among the criteria for determining the priority of candidates for housing is the multidimensionality, injuries, disability, etc.

About this [it is referred](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/nationale-sicherheitsstrategie-2195890)on the site of the German government.

"For the first time in the history of our country, we have developed a national security strategy," Germany's Federal Chancellor Olaf Soltz.

According to him, this strategy is an important contribution to the safety of people in Germany.

"Without security, there is neither freedom nor stability, nor prosperity," - said the German Chancellor.

Olaf Scholtz added that the country's political environment has changed in the last one and a half years, in particular, it meant a large -scale invasion of Russia and attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

“Security in the 21st century is more than hostilities and diplomacy. The Russian Agressive War against Ukraine has shown that peace and freedom do not fall from the sky. This applies to, for example, medicines, as well as cyberspace and cleanliness of water, ”Germany's Minister of Law Berbb said.

The strategy is based on three "central dimensions" of security policy: defense, stability and stability. It states that "today's Russia is the greatest threat to peace and security in the Euro -Atlantic region.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-14T7-38-00-03-00/630_360_1686771404-634.jpg)The parliamentary parliament was sentenced to blast the dams of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, the fault for which the fair majority of the Bundestag members put on Russia and demands the punishment of responsible ones.

The situation was discussed on Wednesday, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

The deputy from the Union of the Union of 90- "Green" Robin Vagain called the conscious blasting of the dam "the most terrible man-made disaster, which has been in recent decades." Tens of thousands of people were in the area of disaster, and from left to the shore the invaders also hindered evacuation. Water supply has been affected for 700,000 Ukrainians, the World Health Organization prevents cholera burning, and the crop reduction will be felt in many corners of the world. "Intention of nature is nothing more than an ecocid," the politician emphasized.

He also spoke for emergency emergency assistance to Ukraine and assistance to the reconstruction, as well as support on the EU's journey to Ukraine. In addition, the perpetrators of this crime should be held accountable, and Ukraine should hold even more weapons to win the war and release their territories.

His one -party officer Jurgen Trittin called the blasting of the dams another crime, Inagada was that it was Russia's first attack on a hydraulic company. "We have to put the end of the statement of avoiding responsibility," he urged. What happened, the expected deficit of grain, should be a signal for all those who say, "This is a non -war."

"We condemn this way of warfare. It is clear to us that Ukraine's support in this new dimension is more urgent than ever. We continue to help Ukraine, including weapons, ”said Niels Schmid, a representative of the ruling social -democratic party. He advocated the recognition of an ecocid during the war criminal offense in international criminal law, there is no need to be persecuted as a military crime. Schmidta also emphasized the need to pay more attention to the safety of such sensitive objects as nuclear power plants.

The representative of the Agnes Strak-Zimmermannaskaya Frace of the Free Democratic Party was a tragedy of water use as weapons. “It shows what cruelty Putin is leading this war. He should be responsible for this in the Hague, ”she said, and Putin said that Putin with her imperial ambitions and the desire to make Ukraine to close her way to the West," will not be able to prevent this even with the help of 80 billion liters of water.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3722886-pidriv-kahovskoi-ges-zbitki-ribnoi-galuzi-ocinuut-u-ponad-11-milardiv.html)Representatives of the Opposition Conservative Bloc of the CDU/CSS also spoke projected to continue and strengthen Ukraine's support, in particular, weapons. Yes, Johann David Vadeful called the destruction of the dam "crime against humanity", as a crime against plants and animals. "To ensure that such catastrophes are unique, the German government must support Ukraine so quickly and so vigorously that it can win this war," Vadeful said. His one -party officer Knutabrags noted that the fact that Russia is successful in showing its weakness. “Russia acts as a terrorist country. It is a war crime, it is terror, ”he said.

Left and right “alternative for [Germany](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina)"On the one hand, they expressed their condolences to the victims, but they were also insisting on the cessation of supply of weapons to Ukraine, which, they say, did not contribute to the war, but only leads to escalation. The left demand the ceasefire of the negotiations, although they speak of "a crime that is not justified", the lawyers "do not know" who is guilty of blasting the dams.

We will remind, the dam on the Dnieper in the south of Ukraine [was destroyed by Russian ones](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3718751-rosijski-zagarbniki-pidirvali-kahovsku-ges-ok-pivden.html)June 6.

However, you can say that in the entire period of large -scale invasion, Ukrainian losses are inconsistently less than hostility. This also applies to last week. We have twelve -giving directions where the offensive - "Khortytsia" and "Tavriya". According to Khortytsia - 8.73 times the enemy killed in the enemy. If we talk about Tavriya, the enemy killed 5.3 times more than ours.

Anna Malyar added that a lot of Russian information custom is recorded on Tsetham.

- In this way, the enemy tries to demoralize Ukrainian society, sore mobilization, because it causes fear of people, and, conversely, raised their army, - said Anna Malyar.

He just spoke with President of Poland Andrzej Duda - an hourly conversation, first and foremost. The situation on the battlefield now, weapons for our soldiers, shells. Thanked for the implementation of previous defense arrangements.

Of course, in each conversation we pay considerable attention to long -term safety of peace tharants, and not just for us. And always effective.

Poland quite realistically perceives the need for Ukraine's membership in NATO. And this objective need. Together, we develop a specific content for the Vilnius Alliance summit. This is exactly the moment when the Russian assumptions should be completely broken that someone in NATO is still afraid of Russia. Such assumptions feed Russian aggressive ambitions. We have and can neutralize them. Thank you for the support of Ukraine and the real strengthening of NATO.

Not only today, but also throughout the week, we are preparing for the restoration of Ukraine, which will take place next week. It will be a significant event, a very representative, which will unite the hypolitical, and business efforts to restore our country and the normal life of our people. The key Ukrainian principle is simple and fair, asam: no ruins in Ukraine will remain. We will rebuild everything, we will restore everything, and we know exactly what steps in what timing and what strength should be done to defeat Russian aggression and our reconstruction. When the ruins disappear, not just the aggressor, but the very idea of aggression. And it will be.

Every day, when preparing for this London Conference, we hold long and profound preparatory meetings - all the necessary state institutions are involved, different levels. And we do everything to our vision, the Ukrainian vision - as always, meaningful - the appropriate level of international arrangements has been prepared.

We continue our communication with partners on Russian rocket production. Today, Russian inhumans have inflicted on another rocket launcher in the Odessa - from "calibers". Dozens of components of these "calibers" are placed in Russia. Obviously, every such path of supply is the way to strengthen the terror. The world has tools to block all such paths - from each country, from every company whose components are used by Russian missiles.Please, always remember that we are all obliged in Ukraine to protect our people's lives and independence. Respect for our military, respect for our relatives of our soldiers, respect for the wives and men of all those who stood up for the state is certainly. Thanks to these people is a good thing. Ukraine is grateful, and it is worth showing daily.

Thank you all who are fighting and working for our victory!I especially thank everyone who is now in the battles in the east and south of our country opens the Ukrainian Strategic Space, the Space of Movement to Victory. I thank everyone who is now both in the footpath and in defense, who storms the positions of the invaders and who reflects their tours - thank you all, warriors, for bravery, for durability and for each metr.

This comment was announced on Wednesday by the former NATO Commander -in -Chief of NATO in Europe, retired by Philip Bridlav, and Ukrinform correspondent reported.

“I believe that Ukraine has good, however, not perfect, land resources. And the first thing I would like to point out that in the overall picture there is not enough precise -dialing firearms - I would say directly, atacams and the like(systems - ed.)”, - said the former commander during a meeting of the US -Ukraine working group.

He positively appreciated the contributions, in particular, the United Kingdom, which provides the Armed Forces [rockets](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-raketa)Storm Shadow. However, he said, more than such opportunities are needed, and this can be provided by ATACAMS.
