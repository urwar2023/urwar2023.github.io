With the help of a world web, the aggressor tries to spread the Kremlin propaganda, mislead Ukrainians, provokes cooperation, blackmails and banies. In the war, criminal fraudsters, which are used by various schemes of mischief and illegal profit, were also intensified during the war. In particular, the famous form of "military school" - pseudogloders who allegedly raise funds for assistance of the Armed Forces, wounded defenders or their families. As well as phishing is one of the most common apartments, [reports](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=590744716571025&set=a.232231989088968)Ministry of Veterans.

Villains mainly use phishing references in schemes with payments that are otherwise related to war, they create pages-clones that is fake. Scams for this purpose require, for example, to introduce personal data and a bank card number allegedly for funds for funds or providing a certain social service. Having received the necessary requisites, they assign money from other people's accounts.

Therefore, it is extremely important for the most citizens to adhere to the right clergygiene.

** Meanwhile, the Ministry of Veterans of Ukraine reminds the veterans of their families about compliance with the rules of cybergigiene: **

* not to inform confidential information, including bank card data, to third parties; *(To pay certain social services, the Ministry of Veterans of Ukraine uses only a personal account number of a veteran or a member of his family(IBAN)); * Do not go for the dubious hyperlinks that send you. *(Note that official pages of state bodies, charitable organizations, banking structures in messengers and social networks should be verified(contain the mark); * to receive information, especially about financial payments from the Ministry of Veterans, only from official sources.* In case of fraudulent suspicion - immediately report to law enforcement agencies.

** Remember that even in war conditions, real bank staff, or state -level workers do not ask for such information. **

In this decision, part of the Ministry of Defense's proposals in the interests of defense capabilities was supported, namely, justice was partially restored against Ukrainian suppliers of goods, works and services for defense needs. The sophisticated Ukrainian business will be equal in rights with a foreign business, as a defense department. This will ensure predictability, rhythm of supply and payment under contracts(contracts).

Про це йдеться у[матеріалі](https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2023/07/12/ministerstvo-oboroni-ukraini-prodovzhit-zahishhati-ukrainskih-virobnikiv-v-interesah-sil-oboroni-ukraini/)on the official website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

In particular, the Cabinet of Ministers has determined that as part of the value(prices)goods, works and services to meet the needs of the security and defense sector(Supply reward)performer.

“Formally protecting the interests of Ukrainian business is not a responsibility of the Ministers Defense. But only formally. Because the stable work of Ukrainian state and private suppliers of weapons, equipment, ammunition, objects of support is the direct interest of the Armed Forces and other components of defense forces. By protecting Ukrainian business, we protect the interests of defense. This is overwhelming sovereignty, our margin of strength. We need more Ukrainian weapons. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense consistently advocates that the Ukrainian business is developing, increasing production capacity. We simplify administrative processes, created a special mechanism - the MOU accelerator to quickly conduct OVT developers with bureaucratic slums. Thanks to this, we already have a durable dynamics for UAV production, we are already fully provided by the Army of Army helmets, bulletproof vests, basic positions of real property. Therefore, I considered and consider the requirements of the State Judicial Service to actually put the interests of foreign producers higher than Ukrainian and deprive the Ukrainian business right to profit. There is no logic in this, it is directly intensified by the interests of defense and the norms of the current legislation, ” - said Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov.The requirements of the State Judicial Service, which are considered by the Ministry of Defense, are unambiguous and appealed in court, with respect to the recovery of the funds specified as a profit from the Ukrainian business that cooperated with the sector and safety from the beginning of the legal regime of martial law.

This creates the conditions for violation of the stable work of Ukrainian producers there is a negative impact on the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

“Unfortunately, government colleagues, including those whose direct duty is to protect the Ukrainian economy, have not supported the position of the Defense Ministry in part, which is being restored to the restoration of justice since the beginning of martial law. For example, the defendants are current contracts with the leaders of the Ukrainian OPC, which end in 20124-25. We have hundreds of current contracts with Ukrainian producers this year. How to be with them? How to be with those that have already been fulfilled? The possibility of double interpretation of norms and pressure on business. Mindobors with this approach does not agree, so we will continue to challenge the approval of the State Judicial Service to law enforcement in court, ” - said the Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov.

Thus, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry spoke about security guarantees for Ukraine, which is to provide allies.

The statements that Western weapons are killing Ukrainians when they are defending their depressor, is a bold manipulation, as the Russian army is killed by the Russian army.

Putinists also deny such statements by such statements to the subject of Ukraine and to blame the West of the War against the Russian Federation, although Russia is the aggressor by the occupier.

The Western partners of Ukraine have repeatedly expressed their solidarity and support until the final victory in the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which is very unpleasant to the Kremlin, so it continues the information campaign from the discrediting state.

He compared it with a long -range missile against Russia.

“The Russians should clearly see the understanding of the West that Ukraine is on the side of the West that Russia cannot get Ukraine. Whatever they have nostalgia in the past.

This was reported by the Director of the Center for Energy Research Alexander Kharchenko during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.

But despite this, Ukraine has a chance to "normally" undergo the next heating season.

“If the attacks on the power system are not restored, then, almost probably, we have a demose period normally and without large -scale emergencies. Although certain regions are very vulnerable, and there is definitely a certain effort to focus, ”Kharchenko stressed.

In his opinion, it is necessary to emphasize on the restoration of high -voltage networks and the prepayment of physical protection of energy objects, since the likelihood of new attacks by the nervous system is high.

He wrote about it in a column for [Forbes Ukraine](http://forbes.ua/money/andriy-pishniy-pro-te-chomu-mizhnarodnu-viyskovu-dopomogu-ukraini-ne-varto-rozglyadati-yak-ekonomichni-vitrati-krain-donoriv-13072023-14777), reports Ukrinform.

"Since the beginning of a full -scale invasion of military assistance to Ukraine, 32 countries have been provided. Some of them in the amount of 0.5-1.0% of their GDP 2022. General in this direction before Ukraine during 2022 reached more than 60 billion US the world economy, "the NBU head.

We do not stop thank all our partners for large -scale support; The grounds of the lush, "it is really striking and decisive for winning."

At the same time, there are 5 reasons for Ukraine's international military assistance as economic losses of donor countries.

The first factor is the economic effect of dominoes, that is, we have a positive influence of partners' costs related to military assistance to Ukraine.

"Each currency spent in the defense sector has the potential to generate additional GDP through various channels. According to the NBU specialists, the increase in military expenses of donor countries by $ 1 is associated with an increase in IVPP by 0.65 during a year NBU Chairman.

At the same time, the most significant additional impact on the increase in the cost of defense will be over time-in one or two years after assistance, and reaching 0,79-0.87 USD.

"However, this is not all, because the positive effects will be maintained even in five years after spending," the lush adds.

Secondly, providing military assistance stimulates research and development in donor countries, and "it will contribute to long-term growth of productivity."

In addition, it is "mistakenly underestimating the possibility of testing weapons" and expanding opportunities for exporting weapons and finding new markets, which is where former Russian weapons were also at the expense of former buyers. These are the third and fourth processors.

Fifth, according to the head of the NBU, "military assistance to Ukraine is a contribution of a new structure of global security." And in this context, he is convinced, assisting Ukraine with weapons and finances to achieve peace- it is an opportunity to reduce the overall expenditure in the future.

"So, we have the following conclusion: international assistance to Ukraine is a much smaller burden for the economy of partners than it is declared in those speculative ones that we are increasingly hearing," Lusny summed up.

The "foreign policy" section of the document, in particular, refers to the relations of the PRC, which, especially after the start of a full -scale Russian aggressive warfare in front of Ukraine, "are of direct importance for the security policy of Germany."

“Russia's invaders against Ukraine is a fundamental violation of the statuon. China is unconvincingly protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, while supporting the anti -Natoto Russian narratives. We have a dialogue with China and urge him to clearly position ourselves with the anticipation of the anti -Russian invading war, ”the document goes.

It emphasizes that the permanent members of the UN Security Council have a special responsibility to comply and protect the UN Charter. Germany expects to support the sovereignty, territorial sake and principles of the UN Charter by "specific actions".

The German side reminded in this context that in a joint declaration of 4 February 2022, China and Russia pledged to significantly intensify the cooperation of the ear spheres and condemned the prospect of further expansion of NATO, claiming the ceiling spheres of influence in their respective regions.

The German government also warned Beijing from attempting to change the status quo in the Taiwanese prototon, which is central to the peace and stability of the Vasian Pichihooocian region and far beyond it.

Berlin is increasingly perceived by China as a "geopolitically important subject -safety policy", whose behavior also affects the interests of the safety of Europe, the document stated.

China has changed, which is why we should also change the way of working with China," the head of the foreign policy department has arranged during the presentation.“We want to work with [China](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj)So we need China, but we also need China in Europe, ” - said Plomatka.

According to Ukrinform correspondent, he said this on Thursday during a trip to Finland at a joint press conference with the Finnish President Saulinini.

“I do not think that this war can take years for two reasons. First, I get sick that [Russia](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)She would be able to support forever, especially in terms of her resources and opportunities. Secondly, I think the circumstances will arise in which President Putin will eventually decide that this war is not in the interests of Russia-neither economic, political, nor any others. But I cannot predict exactly how it happens, ”Biden said.

According to him, it will be seen that "Ukraine is moving in its offensive, and this, in turn, will lead to settlement by negotiations somewhere in this way."

“When asked about whether or not(Decision on the future membership of Ukraine VNATO)Putin from the continuation of the fighting or not, the answer is: the war is already being consumed. Putin has a real problem. How will he come out of it? What to do? ” Biden said.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/13/politics/white-house-cocaine-investigation/index.html).

The department stated that the staff of the Secret Service reviewed the security systems and traveled the image of several hundred people who entered the Western screen of the White House a few days before cocaine was detected and not able to form the suspect.

The secret service added that the FBI laboratory found "insufficient DNA" on the package and could not find fingerprints.

"Therefore, the secret service cannot compare the evidence with a separate group of persons," he comes in a statement.

Investigators were also unable to determine the specific moment or day when the drug was left in the White House.

The source familiar with the course of the investigation, noted that the main theory of research remains that the bag left one hundred visitors, which was in the western wing on the excursion. It stressed that the drug was discovered by water from the drawers, where visitors should leave their phones.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-13T48-00-00-04-00/5858.jpeg)The results of the NATO Vilnius Summit were summed up by experts. The Discussion Panel on the topic "Summary and Evaluation of the NATO Summit" took place in [Military Mediacenter](https://youtu.be/3hVi43iVPPE). Під час її роботи експертипроаналізували перспективи набуття Україною членства в НАТО у світлі рішень тазаяв лідерів держав Альянсу.

Ключовими під час обговорення стали питання, яких гарантій безпеки чекаєУкраїна до вступу в НАТО і чи спроможні західні партнери нашої держави їхзабезпечити. Обговорили також питання про те, де саме проходять «червонілінії» між Альянсом та російською федерацією і якою саме має бути стратегіяНАТО щодо рф.

Відкрив роботу дискусійної панелі заступник виконавчого директора Радизовнішньої політики «Українська призма» Сергій Герасимчук. Він зауважив, щонеоднозначність в оцінках результатів саміту спричинена тим, що віяломожливостей під час зустрічі було досить широким, і той факт, що остаточнітексти документів ухвалювались уже під час саміту, а не напередодні, свідчитьпро суттєві розбіжності між учасниками. Утім, відмінні бачення все ж вдалосьпривести до спільного знаменника.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-13T48-00-00-04-00/54646.jpeg)- As a result, we have what can be called uncertain certainty. They were certainly certain that Ukraine would become a member of NATO. They were a certain certainty that we will have to do it without a MAP, which is accepted as a positive fact. But the uncertainty remained in the case when the ceiling is, and in what specific steps Ukraine should take in order to happen, - he emphasized.

According to the expert, the decision to cancel the NATO membership plan in the NATO is positive and negative. The replacement of the MAC will be programs that will be evaluated by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and the Ministers of Defense of the North Atlantic Alliance. Ukraine has been participating in such programs since 2003, that is, our country has been implementing the Donato Affiliation Program for 20 years.

- Now you need an understanding of how the reforms will be implemented and which will be given to these resources. Because what reforms need to be implemented is a fact, but is usually not only a labor -intensive but also quite expensive process, - said.

Therefore, if the new program provides for the financing of technical expert assistance, it will be a big plus for Ukraine.

** Sanctions in action **

- Sanctions are valid. For example, the Kazan helicopter plant was able to execute the plan by less than 50%as a result of termination of trade with Ukrainian enterprises. It was planned to build more than 100 Mi-8 units, but they failed. He also reported from sanctions Russian Avtovas, whose revenue decreased by 44%, with related assets - by 3%, with net profit decreased seven times, - the expert said.

According to Oleksandr Remryak, the head of the SVP sanction policy and JV of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, it suffers from sanctions and a banking system. For example, the VTB Bank had already received a loss of half a trillion rubles.

"VTB Bank has already got a loss of half a trillion rubles"

За її словами ніч на півдні була неспокійною. Ворог застосовував тактикурозосередження Сил оборони, в тому числі й протиповітряної оборони.

— Запуски «шахедів» відбувалися як із класичного напрямку — з узбережжяАзовського моря так і з Курської області. Серед хвиль пусків дронів такожвідбувалися пуски ракет з акваторії Чорного моря.

Therefore, the guarantee of assistance from the countries of the Great Seven, decorated in bilateral -huggas, are critical for Ukraine.

- As it turned out, it is much easier to reach a consensus in Ukraine in the Great countries. I think that these countries will be joined by others - Poland, countries of Baltic.

According to Ukrinform, this is in an interview [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/13/ukraines-top-security-official-dismisses-ben-wallaces-criticisms-of-kyiv)The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Danilov said.

“If all of us were helped by Britain, we would have a better situation. In particular, thanks to Britain, we were able to withstand the first period as well as the United States. Boris Johnson was the first to communicate with whom our president communicated at the beginning of the war. I still have this historical entry, ”said [Danilov](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-danilov).

According to him, the G7 statement on long -term support of Ukraine is another fuck in the coffin of the imperial ambitions of Russia.

“The most positive result of this summit(NATO - order.)- This is that the wrapper is the land restoration of the Russian Empire. Russia cannot be an empire of the Bezraine, and after they have done with us, we will never be with them at least 50, 80, 100 years old, ”he added.

This was stated by the expert of the Center for Defense Strategies Alexander Hara during the disposal panel on the topic: "Summary and Evaluation of NATO Vilnius Summit" in [Military Media Center](https://youtu.be/3hVi43iVPPE). Завдяки цьому взахідних партнерів будуть юридичні зобов’язання надавати допомогу Україні.

— Можуть бути вибори, інші люди прийдуть і можуть щось скасувати, але в будь-якому разі ці юридичні зобов'язання допомагатимуть нам і, найголовніше, що цена тривалий час і повністю. Мені дуже подобається теза As long as it takes —мається на увазі десятки років, — наголосив експерт.

Водночас він зауважив, що не слід ставити на одні терези поняття наданнябезпекових гарантій та надання довготривалої безпекової допомоги, бо з бокузахідних партнерів йдеться саме про зобов’язання й угоди, а не про гарантії.Це необхідно чітко усвідомлювати, щоб не давати українському суспільствуневиправданих надій та завищених очікувань.

— Найбільшим здобутком України є саме декларація «Великої Сімки», — наголосивексперт. — Це дуже вигідна модель, бо декларація задає загальні рамки, а далібудуть двосторонні обов’язки. З одного боку, вони не можуть бути вищими, ніжті гарантії, які дає декларація. З другого ж боку, саме характер двосторонніхдомовленостей дозволяє Україні розуміти, що партнер не буде ховатися запринципом вето, який існує в НАТО.

Звичайно, партнери будуть насамперед враховувати власні інтереси, однак такиймеханізм простіший для практичного втілення, ніж отримання допомоги в межахПівнічноатлантичного альянсу.

During live broadcast in [Telelorphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA) «Єдині новини»заступник командувача Східного угруповання військ Збройних Сил України зістратегічних комунікацій полковник Сергій Череватий розповів про обстановку насході України та, зокрема, в районі міста Бахмут.

— Наші війська мають частковий успіх на південному фланзі, закріплюються нарубежах, — розповідає офіцер. — Загалом ініціатива належить Силам оборони.Триває щоденна бойова робота. Крок за кроком, максимально зберігаючи особовийсклад, ми рухаємося для того, щоб зайняти панівні висоти й витіснитипротивника з його рубежів.

За словами полковника Сергія Череватого, ворог чинить неймовірний спротив.Протягом доби він завдав по українських захисниках 538 ударів зі ствольної тареактивної артилерії, а також здійснив два авіанальоти. Під час п’яти бойовихзіткнень на цьому напрямку було знищено 71 окупанта, 141 — зазнав поранень іодин потрапив у полон. Підбито чотири ворожі танки, бойову машину десанту, двіустановки РСЗВ БМ-21 «Град», три гармати, дві САУ «Гіацинт-С», двапротитанкові ракетні комплекси, один зенітний ракетний комплекс «Стріла-10»,комплекс візуального спостереження «Муром-М» та п’ять БПЛА.

На Лимано-Куп’янському напрямку противник накопичує досить потужне угрупованняз повітрянодесантних та піхотних підрозділів, а також для підсиленняконцентрує підрозділи так званого бойового армійського резерву БАРС,територіальні війська, невеликі приватні військові компанії на кшталт«ветеранів» та штурмові роти «шторм-z», укомплектовані засудженими.

Як говорить полковник Сергій Череватий, цей напрямок залишається лідером закількістю артилерійських та авіаційних ударів ворога: тут противник обстрілявпозиції Сил оборони 665 разів та завдав 11 авіаударів. Також на цьому відтинкуфронту відбулось три штурми наших позицій — два біля Новоселівського і одинпоблизу Білогорівки. Усі спроби штурмових дій ворога були відбиті й він зазнавутрат: 28 окупантів знищено, 120 поранено. Також українські захисникиутилізували дві ворожі бойові машини піхоти, 240-мм самохідний міномет«Тюльпан», дві САУ «Акація», гаубицю Д-30, п’ять БПЛА, один дрон-камікадзе,один польовий склад з боєприпасами та сім автомобілів, що підвозили цібоєприпаси.

— Відбуваються бої, ворог неодноразово намагався прорвати нашу оборону, алевсі ці спроби виявилися невдалими, — свідчить Сергій Череватий. — Ситуаціяповністю контрольована.

Now at the Summit in Vilnius, we have received the Hurry agreements for Ukraine with almost all partners. We were very good with us with President Biden, with his team: Minister of Defense Oostin, National Security Advisor Sullivan.

With everyone in the Great Seven, they managed to meet many partners in NATO. Now, each such arrangement is made by a specific result. We have RaduUkraine - NATO, and this format must work meaningfully. We prepare proposals to our partners. There are new arrangements for weapons, equipment, aviation, and we specify the innovations. The preparation of the Crimean platform was also discussed today.

We are very successful our agreement on safety guarantees for Ukraine on the way to the preparation of treaties with countries. Bilateral contracts.

Answering the questions of the presenters [Tele scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The only news, the deputy commander of the Eastern Grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Sergey Cherevaty, the emergence of the Nateratri of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and later the sudden disappearance of the Kadyrovtsi units, which has long had glory, but "combat tickloke."

- Kadyrovtsi have been spotted in our operating area in the Kitezhiyivka area and Navativka, - the officer explains. - Their appearance was caused by the lack of reinforcement or attempt to scare us, as they have previously been very bad - now they know whom they can be frightened. The fighting with them showed clearly that their business is gendarme and police. As warriors they have no value. After loss, they retreated, and I think if they tried again in fighting with heated fire and hardened fights of Ukrainian combat brigades, they will be waiting for the same fate as Wagner, which was initially broken, and yesterday we could see the footage, When they already transfer their weapons to a regular army.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-13T76-00-00-04-00/230.jpg)Finally, the Ukrainians will get rid of the coat of arms of the USSR, and a trident will appear on the shield of the Motherland monument. It is this symbol today that not only embodies feelings of dignity, but also emphasizes the historical heritage and grandeur of Ukrainians. So Ukraine continues to overcome the negative consequences of communization and Russification.

About this [informs](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/istorychnyi-proekt-mkip-tryzub-batkivshchyny-na-shchyti-monumenta-batkivshchyna-maty-ziavytsia-ukrainskyi-herb)Government portal.

Already ** The process of installation of the artistic composition "Trizub" is the "Homeland-mother" **. Next - the manufacture of composition, preparation work, manufacture and installation of construction for installation works, direct dismantling of the coat of arms of the USSR and installation of a trident.

The replacement of the coat of arms of the USSR by trident a year ago was supported by 85% of respondents who took the participation in a survey in "Action". And this survey became the most widespread.

“We have been working on this case for over a year and we can finally report the historical project of the Trizub Motherland. This is a very complicated process, so ideas and intentions to do so have remained unfulfilled. The money of the interconnection of historical justice is now collected solely from the great business, which wants to be involved in the great project in every sense of the project.

So, we work with a unique sculpture-representative of the older generation, who accepts a new reality with all his steel heart and contributes to our freedom and independence for our freedom and independence, ”said the Minister of Culture of Culture and Information Policy Alexander Tkachenko.

На цьому закцентувала увагу старший аналітик фонду «Повернись живим» МаріяКучеренко під час дискусійної панелі на тему «Підсумки та оцінки Вільнюськогосаміту НАТО» у [Military Media Center](https://youtu.be/3hVi43iVPPE). Вонанаголосила, що від ситуації небажання дратувати путіна розширенням НАТО наСхід Альянс прийшов до чіткого твердження про те, що Україна неминуче маєстати членом Північноатлантичного Союзу.

Разом з тим експертка підкреслила, що ми дещо завищували очікування відсаміту, тому слід бути реалістами і розуміти, що взаємодія з партнерамипередбачає врахування насамперед їхніх безпекових інтересів. В цілому жпідсумки саміту можна вважати успішними для України.

— Ми побачили результат у вигляді коммюніке, ми побачили результат у виглядігарантій безпеки від Великої Сімки, — підкреслила вона. — Офіс Президента можетрактувати це як свій успіх. Документ, який готувався як Київський компакт ібув презентований як Київський компакт, ліг за основу тих гарантій, які намсьогодні запропонувала Велика Сімка.

Водночас до досягнутих результатів слід ставитись максимально прагматично,оскільки обіцянка членства у НАТО ще не є членством в Альянсі. Прийнятийдокумент містить певний ризик, оскільки передбачає можливість гальмуванняпроцесу вступу України до НАТО.

— У будь-який момент ми можемо повернутися до ситуації, коли нам говорять, щови не готові, ви маєте чудові гарантії, ми нормально спілкувались і не требафорсувати події, — зауважила Марія Кучеренко.

Тому необхідно розділяти емоційні очікування громадян України від результатівсаміту та критичний аналіз прийнятих у Вільнюсі рішень. Притаманне західнимпартнерам України безпекове бачення світу дещо відрізняється від загостреноговійною погляду з України, тож не слід очікувати, що держави члени НАТО будутьдіяти достоту точнісінько саме так, як хотілося б зараз українцям.

Завдяки доказовій базі Служби безпеки вдалося засудити російського шпигуна,який, перебуваючи в рф, створив агентурну мережу в Україні.

Про це[повідомляє](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=642551867971727&set=a.276500821243502)Служба безпеки України.

Зловмисником є кадровий співробітник управління фсб у Красноярському країІванченко Олександр Юрійович.

Встановлено, що він готував теракти проти Сил оборони і збирав інформацію ізприфронтових регіонів України. Робив це через декількох агентів, яких курувавособисто.

Так, у 2017 році Олександр Іванченко завербував киянина і після декількох«тестових» завдань «законсервував» його.

На початку повномасштабного вторгнення рф співробітник фсб «активував» свогоагента і дав йому вказівку прибути до Чернівецької області.

Там зрадник мав встановити і передати агресору локації залізничних вузлів ілогістичних складів, які задіяні для тимчасового базування і перекиданняукраїнських військ на фронт.

Розвідінформація потрібна була російським окупантам для здійснення серіївибухів на інфраструктурних об’єктах Буковини.

Втім, Служба безпеки спрацювала на випередження і затримала ворожого агента напочатку цього року.

Крім того, співробітник фсб збирав інформацію і з прифронтових районівУкраїни.

Особливо його цікавили точні координати місць дислокації підрозділів Службибезпеки та окремого полку спеціального призначення «Азов».

Але і в цьому випадку СБУ заблокувала всі спроби російського шпигуна отриматипотрібну йому інформацію.

На підставі зібраних доказів суд визнав його винним за ч. 1 ст. 114Кримінального кодексу України (espionage)And appointed 15 years of deprivation.

Since the person is hiding in the territory of Russia, complex proceedings continue to be held accountable for crimes against our country.

The investigation was carried out by the SBU staff in the Chernivtsi region of the presenter leadership of the regional prosecutor's office.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-13T88-00-00-04-00/photo1689263073.jpeg)As a counteraction to international sanctions aimed at the embargo supply to the RFellemics of military and double -use, in the terrorist state, they change the high quality components with their own or cheaper analogues. However, a large list of details simply cannot be replaced by surrogates. And it is for manufacturers of such artificial products that international controllers should be paid attention to international controllers. About it within the framework of the circular table "Why Russia bypasses International Sanctions", which took place in the NMILITARY MEDIA CENTER, shared the head of the research laboratory of science and methodological support of measures of military-technical cooperation of the Central Research Institute of Arms and Military Technics.

The military expert informed that in 2015, the Russian Federation had the provision of the e-component base for the production of weapons and military equipment. In particular, it is enshrined that under each sample of the OVT at the stage of the sketch of the draft the developer is obliged to present the element base he needed, which it is impossible to replace it with analogues of Russian production from the beginning of production of the stock of this element base, minimal on a year of interruption. Of course, some components are replaced by cheap analogues from Asian countries, but some components are artificial. For example, rocket processors.

“It is necessary to emphasize precisely on the blockade of manufacturers of this type of elemental base. There are a very small list and analogues are not too many. These can be blocked for Russian. Or you can make a separate product that sets, for example, a purely $ 200 on the market, the Russians reach a minimum of 200000. That is, it is also a type of sanction, also an impact on their economy. The ammunition immediately grows in the price ”, ** - ** Petro Shapoval said.

The expert stressed that no one in free economies can prohibit entrepreneurs to supply dual -purpose goods to third countries. But to track suspicious operations to the supervisory authorities is not so problematic. He cited an example with conditional firms that have traded an elementary base for ten years, which is now too interested in Russians, in the volume of ten thousand -language goods, and then dramatically increased such a resale by 500%. It is such firms that should attract the increased attention of sanctions inspectors.

**росія шукає найрізноманітніші шляхи і рішення для того, щоб обійтиміжнародні санкції, накладені на неї щодо постачання з-за кордонувисокотехнологічного приладдя і комплектуючих, які країна-агресор використовуєу зброї, якою веде війну проти України. Своє бачення щодо можливих шляхівподальшої мінімізації таких дій у рамках круглого столу «Чому росія обходитьміжнародні санкції», який відбувся в Military Media Center, поділивсяначальник інформаційно-аналітичного відділу Центру досліджень трофейного таперспективного озброєння і військової техніки (CDTUPP)The General Staff of the Armed Forces Colonel's Zaruba. **

The military expert said that his institution has been preparing the consolidated components and components of the enemy of the enemy for more than a year, the quality of the Center is investigating and providing relevant information about the components and its origin to military and civilian institutions to make corresponding decisions. According to Colonel Zaruba, the Russians continue to actively use double -use components. To identify such facts yopefully to report them both at the interstate political level, so it is also one of the components of sancing work.

The expert shared the appropriate conclusions by the example of one of the intelligence and communication block of KRUZ "Strelets", Russian technology, which allows to increase the coherence and efficiency of units in the combat.

- In trophy technology, we found plug -in desks made by the Swiss firm Fischer Connectors. It is a high -tech, which is also used in many civilian industries whose specialists work in critical conditions. For example, in medicine, for the equipment of rescue services. In order to produce such connections, in Russia, according to several more than several months, there were two Fischer Connectors. They are working now - it is unknown, but until recently on their sites, it was an information about the release of contors and cable collections, which are then used for the manufacture of weapons.

Colonel Zaruba noted that the issues of elements and components related to the so -called double -purpose are a problem how to work with such firms. But, according to him, there are ways of solution:In particular, according to the representative of the CDTPROP, it was in the case of one of the Netherlands company, which sold accessories to the Turkish firm for the production of meredic equipment that were used to produce managed Ivational ammunition and to strike in Syria. Public organizations wrote one reasoned letter to them. Under the pressure of real decasic use of components for weapons production, the manufacturer is terminated with a Turkish mediator.

According to the military analyst, another area of such activity, which is the state cooperation with the countries through which the Russian Federation in transit introduces itself to sub -symbolic high -tech goods.

“We continue to create engineering barriers directly through the state border. We dig anti -tank ditches, we change the terrain.

By preventing the penetration of hostile sabotage groups and crossing border equipment, we install the corresponding mine fields.

We understand that we do not need a state border line with our northern neighbors for a long time, because we do not have on the other side of the border. Therefore, the task is to make a border strip for an impassable.

In particular, in the last decade of the month, we have established 30 anti -tank minefields and barriers using more than 5.8 thousand mines. About 5 thousand meters of trenches and 6.5 thousand meters of anti -tanned trenches are equipment along the border. 80 overlapping cracks, shelters and firing positions for the personal composition were built, as well as firing positions for heavy equipment. ”
