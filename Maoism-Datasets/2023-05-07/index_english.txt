They were shocked that the Ukrainian army can already be here. Proper competent planning with the use of all forces and means, situational identity gives preference.

It is now that the mechanized, infantry, mountain and assault units and units of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have the greatest burden of trials.

The professional holiday of the Ukrainian infantry, which our warriors now celebrate in Okopakhna, in training or in battle - another opportunity to repeat: we are proud of more defenders and defenders who serve in the infantry and take the winner every day!

 The Commander of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the General-General of Syrsky posted In Telegram:
“Dear warriors, infantrymen!
Today we celebrate our professional holiday!
It is a holiday of steel and courageous men. Infantry is about endurance, courage, courage and heroism. And about character - it is the basis of stability.
As Karl Clausewitz wrote, the concept of "power of character" is about the firmness of beliefs. It is indifferent whether the latter are the conclusions of a foreign or own system of views, whether they arise from the principles, norms, instant impressions and any other manifestations of the mind.
Infantrymen - always where it is difficult!
In recent years of the war, you have shown that even in the most difficult situations, it is possible to break the course of events in your own benefit. And even where the enemy is numerically, it is possible to conquer the Ukrainian land.
Successful counter -offensive operations have become possible due to the clear discipline of infantry.
Today, the holiday is not only the Land Forces, but also the defenders of the territorial defense, landing troops, the Marines and all who hold the front line, where heavy fights are going on.
Eternal honor to fallen heroes who gave their lives in the fight against Pidlagressor. Glory to all who continue to fight and fearlessly destroys enemies.
I am convinced that in the near future Ukrainian infantry will lift the Ukrainian label above Deoocupovan Donetsk, Lugansk and in the Crimea.
Happy infantry, our dear defenders and defenders of Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!".

Analysts recalled that Prigogine and Kadyrov announced the intention to replace the "Wagner" in Bakhmut by Akhmata militants.
"Prigogine and Kadyrov are probably aimed at presenting the Russian Defense Ministry of Tararegular Russian troops as ineffective and establishing conditions to establish the Ministry of Defense in the failures of Russia in the Bakhmut region," the expert institute said.
The ISW notes that in the decision of Prigogine to transfer responsibility for Bakhmutboy Kadyrov intentionally do not mention the VDV of Russia, which are already operating in the semi -nerve and southern flanks of PEC "Wagner" around Bakhmut.
At the same time, this decision reflects distrust to the Russian military command and positions it as non -volatile from the Russian military department. In addition, the Prishozhin tries to "keep his face" if Wagner is not able to get a bakhmut, and to avoid a repetition of the situation with Soledar, where the RFFV Ministry of Defense was responsible for the city's seizure, experts say.

The ISW points out that such rotation of the "Wagnets" on "Akhmatov" can be the conditions for accusing the Ministry of Defense of Russia of inability to support their efforts.
At the same time, analysts noted that the assumption of Kadyrov that he would be able to quickly move deep into Bakhmut and capture the city, are "typical for his boasting" and does not reflect the tactical situation in the region.
As it was reported, the other day the head of the private military company "Wagner" Yevgenprgozhin stated that since May 10 he would withdraw from Bakhmut of the Donetsk region of his landman. He called the refusal of the Russian Ministry of Defense to give them a complicated amount of ammunition.

 Ukrainian activists in Berlin hope that the Russians will not allow to use such symbolism as St. George's tape.
This is stated in a statement by the Association of Ukrainians Vitsche Berlin, which is in charge of Ukrinform.
It noted that on May 6, the Berlin court suspended the prohibition released by the police on May 5, on the use of Russian and Soviet works and St. George's tape during May 8-9. Earlier, he was convicted of the ban on the use of Ukrainian and symbolism.
“We believe that the demonstration of St. George's tape is a criminal offense with the current legislation, since since 2014 it has been used for the decision and glorification of Russia's attack on Ukraine. In addition, he distorted the Second World War and serves the Russian propaganda for "Ukrainians as Nazis". Therefore, it is not surprising that the urgent application of Narodian flags and St. George's tape came from the Russian propagandist Elena Kolbasnikova and right extremist lawyer, the taletics of Marcus Beziht, ”the statement said.
Read also: Berlin Unlike the "Ukrainian case", Berlin police have already filed a complaint from the Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. Vitsche hopes that the City will consider the use of the symbolism of the Russian aggressor as soon as possible and will not allow it.
Last year, Berlin authorities banned the use of both Ukrainian works and symbolism, including the performance of songs and Russian. This year, for the purpose of "preserving the order", the law enforcement officers decided to apply again in the three greatest places of commemoration of the dead Soviet people. Vitsche has filed a urgent complaint and achieved the cancellation of the police.

 Ukrainian activists in Berlin hope that the Russians will not allow the use of symbolism as a St. George's tape.
This is stated in a statement by the Association of Ukrainians Vitsche Berlin, which is in charge of Ukrinform.
It noted that on May 6, the Berlin court suspended the prohibition released by the police on May 5, on the use of Russian and Soviet works and St. George's tape during May 8-9. Earlier, he was convicted of the ban on the use of Ukrainian and symbolism.
“We believe that the demonstration of St. George's tape is a criminal offense with the current legislation, since since 2014 it has been used for the decision and glorification of Russia's attack on Ukraine. In addition, he distorted the Second World War and serves the Russian propaganda for "Ukrainians as Nazis". Therefore, it is not surprising that the urgent application of Narodian flags and St. George's tape came from the Russian propagandist Elena Kolbasnikova and right extremist lawyer, the taletics of Marcus Beziht, ”the statement said.
Read also: Berlin Unlike the "Ukrainian case", Berlin police have already filed a complaint from the Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. Vitsche hopes that the City will consider the use of the symbolism of the Russian aggressor as soon as possible and will not allow it.
Last year, Berlin authorities banned the use of both Ukrainian works and symbolism, including the performance of songs and Russian. This year, for the purpose of "preserving the order", the law enforcement officers decided to apply again in the three greatest places of commemoration of the dead Soviet people. Vitsche has filed a urgent complaint and achieved the cancellation of the police.

 Russian aggression against Ukraine has negative consequences for Asia and the world, so in the interests of the countries of the region to take a clear position in support of the state and the UN Charter.
This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba in the online existence of the Asia Center of Harvard University(USA).
«Азія знаходиться в епіцентрі тектонічних зсувів у системі міжнароднихвідносин, які відбуваються через російську агресію проти України», — заявиввін.
Міністр підкреслив, що азійський регіон протягом десятиріч виступав глобальнимагентом змін: його держави вибороли незалежність, перемогли імперіалізм,віднайшли власний голос і втілили економічне диво, подолавши бідність.
«Два слова, які я чую від азійських колег дещо частіше, ніж хотілося би, це„солідарність“ та „нейтральність“. Вони висловлюють солідарність з Україною,за що ми вдячні, але декларують нейтральність щодо нас та Росії. Водночас прожодну нейтральність не може бути мови, коли йдеться про агресію, вбивства,терор, зґвалтування, мародерство і масові звірства. Країни Азії мають зайнятичітку позицію на підтримку України та Статуту ООН», — наголосив Дмитро Кулеба.
Голова МЗС переконаний, що розділення світу на Глобальний південь та північштучне. Натомість універсальними для всіх цінностями є принципи Статуту ООН,які необхідно захистити від імперіалізму.
«Новий імперіалізм вже не просто стукає в двері, а вибиває їх. Все через те,що протягом десятиліть світ мав сліпу пляму розміром з Росію. На щастя, це вминулому. Росія програє війну — не лише проти України, але і проти сучасності,розуму та здорового глузду», — заявив він.
Дмитро Кулеба порівняв керівництво Росії з диктаторами минулого, якінапередодні краху своїх режимів намагалися військовою силою втілюватиімперські амбіції, але вже невдовзі втрачали все.
«Російська війна проти України несе лише погані новини для всіх у світі.Українці страждають найбільше, але російська агресія також руйнує життя,економіки та надії людей у багатьох регіонах. Саму тому Росію необхіднозупинити», — зауважив міністр.
Дипломат нагадав, що на початку повномасштабного вторгнення ніхто не вірив вУкраїну, але нині ситуація докорінно змінилася завдяки тому, що українці малисміливість, а світ — гідність.
The minister stressed that Ukraine will win, and Russia will need "generations to choose from the pit that it has driven itself." The main lesson will be that "aggression does not produce any results", and it will be equally relevant for east, east, south and north of the world.
“It is still possible to avoid the collision of civilizations. The world in which the country is supported by each other is still relevant. If we can protect together, so we can withstand other challenges: climate change, food crisis, global inequality, ”he summed up.

 ** This story began in May last year. During the fierce battles of the Naikolaevsky direction, the gunmash of a separate infantry brigade named after Yakovagandziuk, Zabrofeyuk, a powerful 152mm Msta-B gun. For almost a year, the calculation of the gunman Eugene successfully destroys the enemy in the most important areas of church. During this time, artillerymen turned into a scrap of several dozen units
Armyinform correspondent visited the firing position of the Trophy "Msti-B" of the Taudyevsky direction and visually saw how she successfully destroy her former farmers. **

 We are greeted by a tired gun commander.
We see a pile of shot sleeves in the trench. If most of them came to the goal, then for many Horde the night has become the last in life. By the way, the calculation of the once Russian Msti-B is currently working in 24/7 mode. The enemy is unhealthy attempts to attack the positions of Ukrainian defenders near Avdiivka, it is necessary to restrain their invasion daily, causing painful losses. There are many striking achievements on the account. For example, thanks to timely aerial reconnaissance coordinates managed to destroy the 122mm CAU 2C1 "Carnation" in almost 15 minutes. Equally successful was the attack during the battleflowers in the south of Ukraine. Then one shot was amazed by a whole column of hostility. It happened that the first projectile managed to engage in a gas truck and the degrading fire spread to the rest of the fighting machines and trucks.

 - The cannon got unharmed in perfect technical condition, - the platoon commander, the acting commander of the senior officer -violet Denis, attaches to the conversation. - Then we performed tasks near Nikolaev. The reading artillery unit was very timely. Immediately attached to combat work. In a few days, they opened the extent of destroyed goals. It was usually the Horde infantry. They then climbed in the future, and we used to do them daily. Soon in our account appeared tank, BMP, APC and artillery systems. If the Muscovites have found out that such losses were being caused by weapons, they would be more careful about their preservation. But then they were not about it. Orcs tried to save their lives. When Maknaks were fire, they immediately thrown their technique and flew where they were. By the way, this "MSTA-B" is not the only trophy gun in our team. During the fighting, we managed to capture several different artillery systems, ”Denis adds.
According to the gun commander Eugene, the most striking was the destruction of the Rashist Artillery Division 122 mm howitzers D-30, which was part of the elite airborne unit of the invaders. At that time, 14 guns were seized, eleven of which were in working order.

 - After a successful fire damage by the artillery division, the brigadiog suffered devastating losses. I personally saw its consequences, - says Euen. - The shelters are destroyed, cut by the fragments of the building, and also - "garlands" of the dies on the branches of trees and the remains of the bodies of the invaders in the trenches. On that day, we destroy the whole division of the orkiv - close 150 people. Such achievements are very sophisticated and confident in further actions.
Memories and stories about the heroic past are interrupted by the team "To the gun!" The calculation begins to act, all the numbers know what to do. The shells bring to the gun a 43-pound projectile, chargers send it to the barrel, the gunner quotes the gun according to the instructions of the commander and in 3 minutes everything is ready for the shot. The mechanism has been developed to work on automatism. No one makes unnecessary movements. Everything is rationally oriented. The team is heard: "The gun!" And the first shot loudly replicates over the tips of trees. Smoke has not yet dispelled, but the next shell was trunk. A small adjustment of the sight and shot again. The MSTA-B trophy is struck by the accumulation of living force, which again decided to check the strength of the defense of the defenders of Avdiivka.

 Head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Major General Kirill Budanov gave an interview to Yahoonews reporters.
About it reports Gur IU press service.
"As of now, Russia has neither the military nor the economic, anpolitical potential for attempting to attempt a large-scale offensive anywhere in the Ukraine," said Kirill Budanov, the head of military intelligence.
At the same time, according to GUR Chief, the aggressor state is still able to conduct serious defense operations, and this is the problem that Ukraine will have to become.
 Kirill Budanov also reported that the Russian Federation is trying to accumulate a certain stockparetaket to disrupt the Ukrainian counter -offensive.
"However, the truth is that the Russians have erected their missile reserves," said the head of Ukraine's military intelligence.
Cyril Budanov compared the enemy fighters of the so-called PECs by the Igraphers of the Regular Army of the aggressor, saying that the Wagnerivtsi have much preparation. At the same time, the leader of the Wagner PEC Prigozhin uses the great loss of their mercenaries in the war to lead a political campaign:
“His political future is directly related to his physical survival, because the Russian Federation has too many forces that want to eliminate it. Obviously, it will be more important to defend himself, because for him it is not even a question of exile of a gunmark is a question of life and death, ”Kirill Budanov said.
Answering the journalist's questions about the alleged involvement of Ukrainian -specific services in the elimination of a number of Russian public apologists of the Anti -Ukraine war, Kirill Budanov refused to confirm or refute this information:
“Don't continue this topic. All I will comment is that we killed the Russians and will kill the Russians anywhere in the world until the full victory of Ukraine, ”the head of the GUR said.
 Among other things, Cyril Budanov acknowledged that the Russian Federation is able to act in vinformation space, so even an imaginary rocket attack on the Kremlin will be told as "victory", arguing that, in this way, a larger catastrophe in human history.
"It sounds like a joke, but the Russians perceive such nonsense"-explained Major-General Budanov.

 Vladasha has no doubt about the statements of the Ukrainian side that, thanks to the American Patriot air defense system a few days ago, a Russian rocket was killed.
About it reports The source is referenced, Ukrinform reports.
"While the Patriot system successfully counteracts ballistic missiles, its ability to stop hypersonic missiles released from aircraft, by last week, it was a purely theoretical," the publication noted.
According to the source, the interception of such a rocket by Ukrainian puppies has renovated this ability in practice, which is "considered in the Pentagon as a serious event." This is important for several reasons.
First of all, Putin's public statements have been denied that the Nibiradian hypersonic weapons are capable of bypassing any modern anti-air system. Now the Russian Federation does not have a significant number of such rockets, and the sanctions have just made their production.
In addition, CNN, Russians who launched a hypersonic rocket in Kiev, were convinced that the goal would inevitably be affected. Therefore, the work of the Patriot system has questioned such calculations.
At the same time, the fact that the interception was carried out by a Ukrainian crew, trained in Oklahoma, without the presence of American instructors on the spot, is an additional reason for joy in the Pentagon. According to the source, the Ministry of Defense is perceived as a significant return on investment.
At the same time, it is noted in the publication, the fact that Ukrainians have knocked down the rocket, as Russia considered unattainable, should cause serious uncertainty to the Russian Federation.
