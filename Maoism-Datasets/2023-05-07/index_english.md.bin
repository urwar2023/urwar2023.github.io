During an interview with Dmitry Komarov, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov reported that Russia's military leadership hid the real loss of his army at the beginning of the invasion of the territory of Ukraine.

- I was amazed by the cynicality of the Russians. On the day we were in the negotiations of Ubilorus, we even counted 3,000 Russians killed. These are Gostomel, other cities. Our side suggested that their delegations take away the bodies of killed by the soldiers, - said Alexei Reznikov. - The head of the Russian delegation returns to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia, and he says that they do not confirm this information. According to them, they killed several hundred people.

They cynically hid the losses from their leadership. They were afraid to convey this information to the highest leadership of Russia.

- This phrase that they do not throw their own, does not correspond to any reality, - summed up the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

- We used the system "Eyes". This is such a born project from the moment of the refinement of Kyiv region, the liberation of Kharkiv region. Currently, we have thousands of operators of different types of drones from small to large. We constantly keep online observations. All units, commands see the picture. Thanks to these eyes, we were dominating in the air, and our boys were moving forward, - Oleksiyreznikov said.

He stressed that in turn the Russians were afraid to report on the loss of the territory. They could keep it secret for several days. Therefore, when their commanders, who reported for logistics, thought they were in the rear 50-60 kilometers from the front line, and their Ukrainian military was surrounded by the Ukrainian military. They were shocked that the Ukrainian army can already be here. Proper competent planning with the use of all forces and means, situational identity gives preference.

- It is very important to develop the Ukrainian UAV sector. It is necessary to be independent from China, from other states. You need to have your own, independent UAV sector. It will be situational awareness and advantage, ”said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

Today, the commander of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Mykola Oleshchuk has officially confirmed that the Ukrainian air defense for the first time in history has shot down the Russian aerobalist practitioner "dagger". It happened during a night attack on May 4 in the sky of Kyiv region. The X-47 lady released the MiG-31K from the territory of Russia.

Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignati on the air of the Telehorphone "One News" [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5TqaWCCdUg)About the features of the rocket opened the details of the beating of the Russian rocket.

-On May 4, at about second o'clock in the morning, the enemy Mig-31K rose from the Savaslaka airfield and from there, in fact, made a start. The Center Air Command, which takes care of the Kyiv region, accompanied this goal. And the goal, in fact, was worked out by the Patriot Division, which is capable of knocking down ballistic routes, - Yuri Ignat informed.

He added that about it today [reported](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/05/06/komanduvach-povitryanyh-syl-pidtverdyv-shho-ukrayina-vpershe-zbyla-rosijsku-raketu-kyndzhal/)In his telegram-channel, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk commander.

The Air Force spokesman also noted that Ukraine needs as much as possible as possibleparatrio, as Russia is the threat of such rockets throughout Ukraine, especially in the eastern direction. But the decision to transfer them is made by international partners.

- The eastern direction is one of the most important, because attacks are occurring, but also the capital of Ukraine is the number one target for the enemy. It is most commonly attacked by Kiev, where all the bodies of our management, power and many infrastructure sites are located, - said Yuri Ignat.

At the same time, he recalled that Ukraine is also expecting SAMP/T and others, which will appear on the next time.

- We expect samp/t, we also expect other Patriot divisions and we will enhance the prototype defense. The most necessary now is what can protect our sky only from ballistic missiles, but also from enemy aviation. We know that there is a serious threat in Russia's use of aviation. That is why we have to get in this direction in this direction to drive away Russian aviation away, - said Yuri Ignat.

He noted once again that the knocking down is a good news.

- Of course, there, behind Parebrik, is burning, but it is not burning for sure the first day, because it is actually such a slap of Russia, - said Yuri Ignat.- Our air forces are grateful to our partners who give us such weapons. It did not believe that Patriot could be in Ukraine so quickly. It may have been ashamed earlier, but as partners could be provided. We want partners to see this weapon at work. We have already shown some videos, showing the world that everything works successfully, - said Yuri Ignat.

“Dear warriors, infantrymen!

Today we celebrate our professional holiday!

It is a holiday of steel and courageous men. Infantry is about endurance, courage, courage and heroism. And about character - it is the basis of stability.

As Karl Clausewitz wrote, the concept of "power of character" is about the firmness of beliefs. It is indifferent whether the latter are the conclusions of a foreign or own system of views, whether they arise from the principles, norms, instant impressions and any other manifestations of the mind.

Infantrymen - always where it is difficult!

In recent years of the war, you have shown that even in the most difficult situations, it is possible to break the course of events in your own benefit. And even where the enemy is numerically, it is possible to conquer the Ukrainian land.

Successful counter -offensive operations have become possible due to the clear discipline of infantry.

Today, the holiday is not only the Land Forces, but also the defenders of the territorial defense, landing troops, the Marines and all who hold the front line, where heavy fights are going on.

Eternal honor to fallen heroes who gave their lives in the fight against Pidlagressor. Glory to all who continue to fight and fearlessly destroys enemies.

I am convinced that in the near future Ukrainian infantry will lift the Ukrainian label above Deoocupovan Donetsk, Lugansk and in the Crimea.

Happy infantry, our dear defenders and defenders of Ukraine!

Glory to Ukraine!".

The meeting is obliged to write in a dry official language. Standard phrases such as "the parties discussed important issues", "The meeting has passed the handset" and so on.

Now I will start picking up words to convey the real atmosphere of the meeting and not to raise the protocol.

The meeting was emotional and frank. Irene Fellin is very well aware of our war and sincerely ill for the fate of Ukraine and Ukrainians.

Irene has heard my speech at an international event in Portugal on the problems of women of icholovik in the Armed Forces, which arose from a full -scale war, and now wanted to talk about it in more detail.

Yes, there are things that can only be discussed in such a personal meeting format.

Irene Fellin is grateful for indifference and active position. "

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-07T-154-02-00-03-00/630_360_1668570305-546.jpg)The founder of the Wagner PEC Yevhen Prigogin and Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov's leader intend to accuse the Russian Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation of Bakhmut.

This is stated in [](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-may-6-2023)Institute of War Study(Isw), reports Ukrinform.

Analysts recalled that Prigogine and Kadyrov announced the intention to replace the "Wagner" in Bakhmut by Akhmata militants.

"Prigogine and Kadyrov are probably aimed at presenting the Russian Defense Ministry of Tararegular Russian troops as ineffective and establishing conditions to establish the Ministry of Defense in the failures of Russia in the Bakhmut region," the expert institute said.

The ISW notes that in the decision of Prigogine to transfer responsibility for Bakhmutboy Kadyrov intentionally do not mention the VDV of Russia, which are already operating in the semi -nerve and southern flanks of PEC "Wagner" around Bakhmut.

At the same time, this decision reflects distrust [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-prigozin)to the Russian military command and positions it as non -volatile from the Russian military department. In addition, the Prishozhin tries to "keep his face" if Wagner is not able to get a bakhmut, and to avoid a repetition of the situation with Soledar, where the RFFV Ministry of Defense was responsible for the city's seizure, experts say.

The ISW points out that such rotation of the "Wagnets" on "Akhmatov" can be the conditions for accusing the Ministry of Defense of Russia of inability to support their efforts.

At the same time, analysts noted that the assumption of Kadyrov that he would be able to quickly move deep into Bakhmut and capture the city, are "typical for his boasting" and does not reflect the tactical situation in the region.

As it was reported, the other day the head of the private military company "Wagner" Yevgenprgozhin stated that since May 10 he would withdraw from Bakhmut of the Donetsk region of his landman. He called the refusal of the Russian Ministry of Defense to give them a complicated amount of ammunition.

About it in [](https://t.me/andriyshTime/9452)The adviser to the city head of the city of Petro Andryushchenko reported, Ukrinform reports.

"Mariupol is waiting for a new problem with drinking water ... The fact is that water comes with a cutting reservoir in the Old Crimea, which is filled primarily through the flow of Kalchik - the same one that the Russians blocked inside the city tauapically turned into a swamp instead of a river. Therefore, with water - water. The misery is terrible. Even in the heat of the water level, the water level of water is not enough for Mariupol, and the blocked Kalchik will not allow the reservoir to be restored, " - explained Vandrunchenko.

"… To realize - thoughtlessly. The project referred to a water -clever plant and the construction of a factic water intake of two reservoirs - the old Crimea and Pavlopolsky. Falling into the details, the Russians decided to combine these two reservoirs now," Andryushchenko said.

He stressed that it could solve the problem - but there is a nuance.

"Pavlopol reservoir should be replenished through Kalmius with the Siversky Donets's Done to work that does not work(Why is there no water of Donetsk). У підсумку, якщо зроблять, то просто вб’ють одночасно дваводосховища та всю флору/фауну навкруги. Остаточно", - додав радник мера.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-07T-57-39-51-03-00/630_360_1683481045-895.jpg)Ukrainian activists in Berlin hope that the Russians will not allow to use such symbolism as St. George's tape.

This is stated in a statement by the Association of Ukrainians Vitsche Berlin, which is in charge of Ukrinform.

It noted that on May 6, the Berlin court suspended the prohibition released by the police on May 5, on the use of Russian and Soviet works and St. George's tape during May 8-9. Earlier, he was convicted of the ban on the use of Ukrainian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-prapor)and symbolism.

“We believe that the demonstration of St. George's tape is a criminal offense with the current legislation, since since 2014 it has been used for the decision and glorification of Russia's attack on Ukraine. In addition, he distorted the Second World War and serves the Russian propaganda for "Ukrainians as Nazis". Therefore, it is not surprising that the urgent application of Narodian flags and St. George's tape came from the Russian propagandist Elena Kolbasnikova and right extremist lawyer, the taletics of Marcus Beziht, ”the statement said.

Vitsche hopes that the City will consider the use of the symbolism of the Russian aggressor as soon as possible and will not allow it.

Last year, Berlin authorities banned the use of both Ukrainian works and symbolism, including the performance of songs and Russian. This year, for the purpose of "preserving the order", the law enforcement officers decided to apply again in the three greatest places of commemoration of the dead Soviet people. Vitsche has filed a urgent complaint and achieved the cancellation of the police.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://president.gov.ua/news/andrij-yermak-obgovoriv-z-ambasadorami-united24-vidomimi-akt-82753?fbclid=IwAR28UC_N6UkT89l969v1vEZ7Z7Ow-YPnyuAQ-84lpbVAbFWdy0rl9xGPWAc).

In particular, a meeting with French filmmaker Michel Azanavichus, an American actress from Ukraine Ivanna Sakhno and Canadian actress Katherin, American actor, director and producer Liev Schreber, as a British director-documentary Andre Singer.

OP head stated that in the issue of the return of Ukrainian children from Russia, as well as the burglary with the aggressor state on the battlefield, the crucial role is played by the world.

"The unity of the world community is as powerful weapons as Himars and Patriot. We continue to look for opportunities and tools by which to be able to convert our children deported by Russia from the occupied territories of Ukraine. Therefore, it is so important to tell the world about this problem to people in The Yamerica remembered that this terrible war continues and the least suffering from it, ”Yermak stressed.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-07T14-24-00-03-00/1683458374-185.jpeg)According to him, this problem has several aspects. The first category of children - those who have parents, from which the invaders were taken away and under the pretext of recovery were taken to the territory of Russia. The second category is minor citizens who have lost their parents but have a grandparents, aunt or uncle, but invaders do not return their children to their relatives, but are given to adoption by the Russian Federation. The most difficult third category is children, illegally exported from orphanages, located on the temporarily captured territories of Ukraine. They are most difficult to identify because the invaders often determine the documents of children, and during the adoption change the names of tanationality.

“One of these effective steps can be the involvement of stars, which on different areas: at film festivals, at the prescription of musical and film award - will tell about the crimes that Russia commits against Ukrainian children, depriving it of their homeland, national identity, mother tongue, etc. The international community pressed on the Russian Federation and demanded that the little Ukrainians be returned, ”Yermak emphasized, adding that many well -known personalities have already had a good time to help.

For her part, Sakhno noted that she was well aware of the problem of deportation of Ukrainian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti). She supported the idea that people at various public sites, including in the US Congress, highlighted this problem and attracted the attention of the American people.

As Vinnik said, if she was not able to study the Ukrainian language, the Ukrainian language in Canada, she would not know her roots and would not be in Ukraine today. "If you are counting on my help, then I'm 100% on your side," she assured.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-07T14-24-00-03-00/1683458374-719.jpeg)Yermak also emphasized the importance of spreading the truthful information of the proceedings in Ukraine in the world, as Russian propaganda continues to work, in particular the Global South Supports, which Ukraine is very much needed.

According to the head of the OP, it is possible to talk about Ukraine through the stories of ordinary Ukrainians, who during this full -scale war carried out a truly heroic. It is, in particular, the history of the defenders of Azovstal and the heroic Debbikivskaya, Kharkiv regions, other regions or the history of the gymnast, which has lost its leg, but continuing and preparing for the competition through Russian shelling.

This is stated in a statement by the Association of Ukrainians Vitsche Berlin, which is in charge of Ukrinform.

It noted that on May 6, the Berlin court suspended the prohibition released by the police on May 5, on the use of Russian and Soviet works and St. George's tape during May 8-9. Earlier, he was convicted of the ban on the use of Ukrainian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-prapor)and symbolism.

“We believe that the demonstration of St. George's tape is a criminal offense with the current legislation, since since 2014 it has been used for the decision and glorification of Russia's attack on Ukraine. In addition, he distorted the Second World War and serves the Russian propaganda for "Ukrainians as Nazis". Therefore, it is not surprising that the urgent application of Narodian flags and St. George's tape came from the Russian propagandist Elena Kolbasnikova and right extremist lawyer, the taletics of Marcus Beziht, ”the statement said.

Vitsche hopes that the City will consider the use of the symbolism of the Russian aggressor as soon as possible and will not allow it.

Last year, Berlin authorities banned the use of both Ukrainian works and symbolism, including the performance of songs and Russian. This year, for the purpose of "preserving the order", the law enforcement officers decided to apply again in the three greatest places of commemoration of the dead Soviet people.

About it in [](https://t.me/andriyshTime/9452)The adviser to the city head of the city of Petro Andryushchenko reported, Ukrinform reports.

"Mariupol is waiting for a new problem with drinking water ... The fact is that water comes with a cutting reservoir in the Old Crimea, which is filled primarily through the flow of Kalchik - the same one that the Russians blocked inside the city tauapically turned into a swamp instead of a river. Therefore, with water - water. The misery is terrible. Even in the heat of the water level, the water level of water is not enough for Mariupol, and the blocked Kalchik will not allow the reservoir to be restored, " - explained Vandrunchenko.

"… To realize - thoughtlessly. The project referred to a water -clever plant and the construction of a factic water intake of two reservoirs - the old Crimea and Pavlopolsky. Falling into the details, the Russians decided to combine these two reservoirs now," Andryushchenko said.

He stressed that it could solve the problem - but there is a nuance.

"Pavlopol reservoir should be replenished through Kalmius with the Siversky Donets's Done to work that does not work(Why is there no water of Donetsk). У підсумку, якщо зроблять, то просто вб’ють одночасно дваводосховища та всю флору/фауну навкруги. Остаточно", - додав радник мера.

This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba in the online existence of the Asia Center of Harvard University(USA).

«Азія знаходиться в епіцентрі тектонічних зсувів у системі міжнароднихвідносин, які відбуваються через російську агресію проти України», — заявиввін.

Міністр підкреслив, що азійський регіон протягом десятиріч виступав глобальнимагентом змін: його держави вибороли незалежність, перемогли імперіалізм,віднайшли власний голос і втілили економічне диво, подолавши бідність.

«Два слова, які я чую від азійських колег дещо частіше, ніж хотілося би, це„солідарність“ та „нейтральність“. Вони висловлюють солідарність з Україною,за що ми вдячні, але декларують нейтральність щодо нас та Росії. Водночас прожодну нейтральність не може бути мови, коли йдеться про агресію, вбивства,терор, зґвалтування, мародерство і масові звірства. Країни Азії мають зайнятичітку позицію на підтримку України та Статуту ООН», — наголосив Дмитро Кулеба.

Голова МЗС переконаний, що розділення світу на Глобальний південь та північштучне. Натомість універсальними для всіх цінностями є принципи Статуту ООН,які необхідно захистити від імперіалізму.

«Новий імперіалізм вже не просто стукає в двері, а вибиває їх. Все через те,що протягом десятиліть світ мав сліпу пляму розміром з Росію. На щастя, це вминулому. Росія програє війну — не лише проти України, але і проти сучасності,розуму та здорового глузду», — заявив він.

Дмитро Кулеба порівняв керівництво Росії з диктаторами минулого, якінапередодні краху своїх режимів намагалися військовою силою втілюватиімперські амбіції, але вже невдовзі втрачали все.

«Російська війна проти України несе лише погані новини для всіх у світі.Українці страждають найбільше, але російська агресія також руйнує життя,економіки та надії людей у багатьох регіонах. Саму тому Росію необхіднозупинити», — зауважив міністр.

Дипломат нагадав, що на початку повномасштабного вторгнення ніхто не вірив вУкраїну, але нині ситуація докорінно змінилася завдяки тому, що українці малисміливість, а світ — гідність.

The minister stressed that Ukraine will win, and Russia will need "generations to choose from the pit that it has driven itself." The main lesson will be that "aggression does not produce any results", and it will be equally relevant for east, east, south and north of the world.

“It is still possible to avoid the collision of civilizations. The world in which the country is supported by each other is still relevant. If we can protect together, so we can withstand other challenges: climate change, food crisis, global inequality, ”he summed up.

During the fierce battles of the Naikolaevsky direction, the gunmash of a separate infantry brigade named after Yakovagandziuk, Zabrofeyuk, a powerful 152mm Msta-B gun. For almost a year, the calculation of the gunman Eugene successfully destroys the enemy in the most important areas of church. During this time, artillerymen turned into a scrap of several dozen units

** Armyinform correspondent visited the firing position of the Trophy "Msti-B" of the Taudyevsky direction and visually saw how she successfully destroy her former farmers. ** **

- They worked almost all night, - says Eugene. - The enemy tried to move in groups and storm the positions of our infantry. They were destroyed by fragmentation and foot shells. As intelligence reported, the enemy suffered significant losses. In addition, their firearms and a large -circuit struggle were actively suppressed.

We see a pile of shot sleeves in the trench. If most of them came to the goal, then for many Horde the night has become the last in life. By the way, the calculation of the once Russian Msti-B is currently working in 24/7 mode. The enemy is unhealthy attempts to attack the positions of Ukrainian defenders near Avdiivka, it is necessary to restrain their invasion daily, causing painful losses. There are many striking achievements on the account. For example, thanks to timely aerial reconnaissance coordinates managed to destroy the 122mm CAU 2C1 "Carnation" in almost 15 minutes. Equally successful was the attack during the battleflowers in the south of Ukraine. Then one shot was amazed by a whole column of hostility. It happened that the first projectile managed to engage in a gas truck and the degrading fire spread to the rest of the fighting machines and trucks.

The reading artillery unit was very timely. Immediately attached to combat work. In a few days, they opened the extent of destroyed goals. It was usually the Horde infantry. They then climbed in the future, and we used to do them daily. Soon in our account appeared tank, BMP, APC and artillery systems. If the Muscovites have found out that such losses were being caused by weapons, they would be more careful about their preservation. But then they were not about it. Orcs tried to save their lives. When Maknaks were fire, they immediately thrown their technique and flew where they were. By the way, this "MSTA-B" is not the only trophy gun in our team. During the fighting, we managed to capture several different artillery systems, ”Denis adds.

According to the gun commander Eugene, the most striking was the destruction of the Rashist Artillery Division 122 mm howitzers D-30, which was part of the elite airborne unit of the invaders. At that time, 14 guns were seized, eleven of which were in working order.

I personally saw its consequences, - says Euen. - The shelters are destroyed, cut by the fragments of the building, and also - "garlands" of the dies on the branches of trees and the remains of the bodies of the invaders in the trenches. On that day, we destroy the whole division of the orkiv - close 150 people. Such achievements are very sophisticated and confident in further actions.

Memories and stories about the heroic past are interrupted by the team "To the gun!" The calculation begins to act, all the numbers know what to do. The shells bring to the gun a 43-pound projectile, chargers send it to the barrel, the gunner quotes the gun according to the instructions of the commander and in 3 minutes everything is ready for the shot. The mechanism has been developed to work on automatism. No one makes unnecessary movements. Everything is rationally oriented. The team is heard: "The gun!" And the first shot loudly replicates over the tips of trees. Smoke has not yet dispelled, but the next shell was trunk. A small adjustment of the sight and shot again. The MSTA-B trophy is struck by the accumulation of living force, which again decided to check the strength of the defense of the defenders of Avdiivka.

Wagner's mercenaries are still trying to capture the city of Bakhmut, the statement of the Prozamine of the Wagnerians on the Kadyrivs in this direction has no confirmation in this direction. Colonel Sergiyerievaty reported on live on the live broadcast of the "Unified News" Televarachone "Unified News".

Sergei Cherevaty also denied the thesis spreading the enemy about the alleged "projectile famine" - the firing of Bakhmut, despite the statements of the invaders about the absence of bottles, they do not stop.

- As we can see, 350 shellings, well, it is probably difficult to talk about a projectile famine. From what I saw in public space, on their publications, only today they exchanged such proposals today(Prigogine and Cadyriv. - Ed.)That one is ready to hand over, and this is to go. No, they are not yet in positions - the Wagnerivtsi actions are conducted, - said Sergey Cherevaty.

** How it is-to have neighbors from which any moment can be arranged by your peaceful settlements with rockets, perhaps the most on planetus understands Israel. Permanent fighting that flashes in this regional-western Asia are constantly accompanied by rocket attacks. Name this state pays so much attention to prevention

Given the extensive experience of Israel in this direction of development of defense technologies, the fact that in Kiev, the Israeli system of early notification began to work in Kyiv in the course of the passing mode. The Ambassador of Ukraine to Israel Yevhen Korniychuk told this [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-741955).

«Україна попросила в Ізраїлю систему оповіщення про ракетні атаки післявторгнення росії минулого року. Попередній уряд обіцяв систему Україні, алепосол відзначив особисту участь прем’єр-міністра Ізраїлю Біньяміна Нетаньяху узабезпеченні швидкого завершення проєкту», — зазначається у матеріалієрусалимської газети.

Український дипломат виказав сподівання, що систему оповіщення швидкодоопрацюють і зможуть встановити у всіх великих містах України.

«Це дуже важливо для нашої цивільної та військової інфраструктури. Цеобладнання, яке дозволить нам рятувати життя», — додав Корнійчук.

Як зазначили ізраїльські медійники, ця система визначає ракети та снаряди всіхвидів та місця, куди вони впадуть, щоб зменшити радіус, де люди можутьопинитися в небезпеці. Вона також визначає, скільки часу піде на пошук укриттяу мешканців району, що перебувають під безпосередньою небезпекою.

Ізраїльський комплекс використовує поєднання радарів та оптичних пристроїв длявиявлення запусків ракет та безпілотників.

Технології ідентифікують розміри об’єктів та визначають небезпеку, після чогодані відображаються на електронній карті. Громадяни, зі свого боку, отримуютьпопередження на телефон або дізнаються про небезпеку через радіо, телебаченняабо сирену.

** How it is-to have neighbors from which any moment can be arranged by your peaceful settlements with rockets, perhaps the most on planetus understands Israel. Permanent fighting that flashes in this regional-western Asia are constantly accompanied by rocket attacks. Name this state pays so much attention to prevention

Given the extensive experience of Israel in this direction of development of defense technologies, the fact that in Kiev, the Israeli system of early notification began to work in Kyiv in the course of the passing mode. The Ambassador of Ukraine to Israel Yevhen Korniychuk told this [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-741955).

«Україна попросила в Ізраїлю систему оповіщення про ракетні атаки післявторгнення росії минулого року. Попередній уряд обіцяв систему Україні, алепосол відзначив особисту участь прем’єр-міністра Ізраїлю Біньяміна Нетаньяху узабезпеченні швидкого завершення проєкту», — зазначається у матеріалієрусалимської газети.

Український дипломат виказав сподівання, що систему оповіщення швидкодоопрацюють і зможуть встановити у всіх великих містах України.

«Це дуже важливо для нашої цивільної та військової інфраструктури. Цеобладнання, яке дозволить нам рятувати життя», — додав Корнійчук.

Як зазначили ізраїльські медійники, ця система визначає ракети та снаряди всіхвидів та місця, куди вони впадуть, щоб зменшити радіус, де люди можутьопинитися в небезпеці. Вона також визначає, скільки часу піде на пошук укриттяу мешканців району, що перебувають під безпосередньою небезпекою.

Ізраїльський комплекс використовує поєднання радарів та оптичних пристроїв длявиявлення запусків ракет та безпілотників.

Технології ідентифікують розміри об’єктів та визначають небезпеку, після чогодані відображаються на електронній карті. Громадяни, зі свого боку, отримуютьпопередження на телефон або дізнаються про небезпеку через радіо, телебаченняабо сирену.

About it [reports](https://gur.gov.ua/content/ataku-na-kreml-rosiiany-pokazuvatymut-iak-peremohu.html)Gur IU press service.

"As of now, Russia has neither the military nor the economic, anpolitical potential for attempting to attempt a large-scale offensive anywhere in the Ukraine," said Kirill Budanov, the head of military intelligence.

At the same time, according to GUR Chief, the aggressor state is still able to conduct serious defense operations, and this is the problem that Ukraine will have to become.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-07T83-00-00-04-00/1.jpeg)Kirill Budanov also reported that the Russian Federation is trying to accumulate a certain stockparetaket to disrupt the Ukrainian counter -offensive.

"However, the truth is that the Russians have erected their missile reserves," said the head of Ukraine's military intelligence.

Cyril Budanov compared the enemy fighters of the so-called PECs by the Igraphers of the Regular Army of the aggressor, saying that the Wagnerivtsi have much preparation. At the same time, the leader of the Wagner PEC Prigozhin uses the great loss of their mercenaries in the war to lead a political campaign:

“His political future is directly related to his physical survival, because the Russian Federation has too many forces that want to eliminate it. Obviously, it will be more important to defend himself, because for him it is not even a question of exile of a gunmark is a question of life and death, ”Kirill Budanov said.

Answering the journalist's questions about the alleged involvement of Ukrainian -specific services in the elimination of a number of Russian public apologists of the Anti -Ukraine war, Kirill Budanov refused to confirm or refute this information:

“Don't continue this topic. All I will comment is that we killed the Russians and will kill the Russians anywhere in the world until the full victory of Ukraine, ”the head of the GUR said.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-07T83-00-00-04-00/2-33.jpg)Among other things, Cyril Budanov acknowledged that the Russian Federation is able to act in vinformation space, so even an imaginary rocket attack on the Kremlin will be told as "victory", arguing that, in this way, a larger catastrophe in human history.

"It sounds like a joke, but the Russians perceive such nonsense"-explained Major-General Budanov.

The head of the united coordination press center of defense forces of southern Ukrainian captain Natalia Humeniuk reported this on the national marathon "Unified News".

“We see imitation of concern for the local population every time the pervasive burns a little. We saw their action on the right bank when they were "active" about the movement of the local population. We see this in the left on the left bank of Kherson region, when we see that they find pseudo-turning to evacuate people deeper-to where they equip their boundaries, and, accordingly, try to place and launch the tampets and cover themselves with local residents.

We observe that exported people in this way fill these places, the devorog tries to place their equipment and units, ”Natalia Gumenyuk said.

When asked by the presenters - whether the enemy really considers the occupied Berdyansk for himself, the head of the united coordination press center of the forces of the South Ukrainian Defense forces replied that the invaders did not consider so, but they want to convince others. "Transportation of the population to Berdyansk is an attempt to demonstrate that it is safer places," the officer said.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

This week ends - very fruitful for Ukraine. And these days we are actively active in new events in May and June. We must make this time not less fertile both in the supply of weapons for our soldiers and in decisions for Ukraine, in negotiations with our partners.

The legislative initiative was important for our society. The preparation of sanctions against the aggressor is ongoing. We are waiting for international meetings in Kiev. We are talking to partners about weapons that will help you to do more for the sake of restoring peace.

This week, our various partners were distinguished in helping Ukraine, in helping Ukrainians. From the United States to New Zealand, from the Netherlands and Belgium Croatia. Northern Europe - Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland. I thank every partner decision to support Ukraine!

We are working out in great detail with our other partners new steps in the help of Ukraine, we expect them in the near future - just what is needed for our power, to protect our sky, for justice against terrorists and for the fastest restoration of peace for all Ukrainian land. I will definitely inform about those decisions that can be spoken in public.

It is very important that the world knows about every fact of Russian terror against our people. That the world speaks what the terrorist state is doing and how we love life. I am grateful to everyone and everyone who helps us, spreading the truth about Russian blows and shelling, about the cruelty of the invaders who are not invited for a day!

And all who help Ukraine to return the safety, all who strengthen partnerships between countries in Europe for the sake of security, for the sake of common force, all who press on the terrorist state are all defenders of the Mir. I thank everyone and everyone in the world who with Ukraine, who supports our military!

The tourism industry of the temporarily occupied Crimea continues to decline: tourism from trips to the peninsula for safety reasons, because of the transport collapse on the Crimean bridge(numerous and multi -time checks), a thirty -hour journey by a rail that no longer attracts anyone. Aviation rates with Simferopol were abolished after the military invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.

About it reports [](http://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-07-23/h_b460a19fabadba404011bbc0ffecb47e)The source is referenced, Ukrinform reports.

"While the Patriot system successfully counteracts ballistic missiles, its ability to stop hypersonic missiles released from aircraft, by last week, it was a purely theoretical," the publication noted.

According to the source, the interception of such a rocket by Ukrainian puppies has renovated this ability in practice, which is "considered in the Pentagon as a serious event." This is important for several reasons.

First of all, Putin's public statements have been denied that the Nibiradian hypersonic weapons are capable of bypassing any modern anti-air system. Now the Russian Federation does not have a significant number of such rockets, and the sanctions have just made their production.

In addition, CNN, Russians who launched a hypersonic rocket in Kiev, were convinced that the goal would inevitably be affected. Therefore, the work of the Patriot system has questioned such calculations.

At the same time, the fact that the interception was carried out by a Ukrainian crew, trained in Oklahoma, without the presence of American instructors on the spot, is an additional reason for joy in the Pentagon. According to the source, the Ministry of Defense is perceived as a significant return on investment.

At the same time, it is noted in the publication, the fact that Ukrainians have knocked down the rocket, as Russia considered unattainable, should cause serious uncertainty to the Russian Federation.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-08T01-08-00-03-00/630_360_1490957505-5736.jpg)The Security authorities have doubts about the statements of the Ukrainian side that, thanks to the US Patriot, a few days ago, a Russian hypersonic missile was shot.

About it reports [](http://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-07-23/h_b460a19fabadba404011bbc0ffecb47e)The source is referenced, Ukrinform reports.

"While the Patriot system successfully counteracts ballistic missiles, its ability to stop hypersonic missiles released from aircraft, by last week, it was a purely theoretical," the publication noted.

According to the source, the interception of such a rocket by Ukrainian puppies has renovated this ability in practice, which is "considered in the Pentagon as a serious event." This is important for several reasons.

First of all, Putin's public statements have been denied that the Nibiradian hypersonic weapons are capable of bypassing any modern anti-air system. Now the Russian Federation does not have a significant number of such rockets, and the sanctions have just made their production.

In addition, CNN, Russians who launched a hypersonic rocket in Kiev, were convinced that the goal would inevitably be affected. Therefore, the work of the Patriot system has questioned such calculations.

At the same time, the fact that the interception was carried out by a Ukrainian crew, trained in Oklahoma, without the presence of American instructors on the spot, is an additional reason for joy in the Pentagon. According to the source, the Ministry of Defense is perceived as a significant return on investment.

At the same time, it is noted in the publication, the fact that Ukrainians have knocked down the rocket, as Russia considered unattainable, should cause serious uncertainty to the Russian Federation.
