Also in Ukraine a plan for humanitarian demining agricultural land has been developed, priority among which are Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, Chernihiv and Cherkasy regions.</p>
<p>“In the context of Ukraine's reconstruction, humanitarian demining is priority.

<p>The enormous path of vaccination from Russian infovids has been traveled. We learned to cut and feel even between the lines of their insidiousness.</p>
<p>It seemed that this rule already subconsciously works for everyone - we believe in official sources.</p>
<p>We do not believe the impersonal sources of information - when there is neither a name nor a name of the Institution, nor other identifying features. When you just don't know who exactly has written.</p>
<p>But the larger the beacon, the more they believe.</p>
<p>The Russians write in telegrams that have happened to our Glavcom.</p>
<p>And what? Well, let them write.</p>
<p>We have denied it - repeatedly. He does his job. And he does not bypass fakes, as well as other commander, whose enemies write fictions.</p>
<p>We do not substitute doubles.</p>
<p>The Russians just test their IPSO. "</p>

<p>Their authorities hid in every possible way that they were dying here, and even in such a number, but now it is no longer possible to hide. Indeed, the Bakhmut campaign for them is the most expensive not only in the sense of how much they have armed with the weapons of Ivian technology, and it was destroyed by our troops, but it is the most expensive - in the sense of human losses.</p>

In addition, they have taken a landing and assault detachments there, so the situation remains complex there,-said Anna Malyar.</li>

The struggle of Ukraine for the freedom and solidarity of Poland will remain in our books forever. Because right now we are writing a history of the future, ”Stefanchuk said.</p>
<p>In the video, the first lady of Ukraine Olenazelenskaya noted that Ukraine and Poland are creating a history that books will be written about.</p>
<p>“What is called the historical moment is happening right now for both countries. During the months of a full -scale Russian invasion, the Poles have been warm and sheltered by millions of Ukrainians, and today it is so warm to receive nurses. And it is also very important for Ukraine, ”said the first lady of Ukraine.</p>

<p>“May 25, Avdiivka. I am on the ruins of two houses - a five -storey -storey -storey one that has been struck. Unfortunately, two civilians are under the same, people were unambiguously driven.

<p>“Unfortunately, this does not greatly encourage the locals to evacuate. I would like to take a second time to evacuate. For, even if a person survives under such assaults, we are unlikely to be able to get them, because there is no special equipment in the city to disassemble these blockages, ”Barabash emphasized.</p>
<p>He added that it is impossible to risk the lives of SES fighters, who will simply be missing in Avdiivka, because 20-25 kilometers of the road to the city are constantly subtracted.</p>

<p>This was stated by the mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko during the video address to the participants of the plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions, correspondent.</p>
<p>“You can often hear about a“ road card ”,“ reconstruction plan ”or“ Marshall Plan ”for Ukraine. Many people think about the restoration of houses, bridges and the road. But it's not. The main priority today is to restore the country. Tseosis that the "roadmap" is needed - how to introduce new rules, for Ukraine, to carry out reforms, to turn Ukraine into a state with European standards, ”the mayor of the capital said.</p>
<p>According to him, it is important today to take care of our day after tomorrow: “We have been having a limited time, and we have to succeed, we must remain strong ... Tomorrow when the war is over, we have to implement all these plans. The success of Ukraine is the best answer for our partners. The success of Ukraine is also the best answer for our enemies, for Russia, which understands only language. ”</p>

<p>Klitschko recalled that decentralization reform has been one of the most successful reforms in Ukraine over the past years, and it is the basis for the stability of the country and democracy. These achievements should not be lost even in the war, when certain politicians try to build vertical power of the surrounding power, while the main principle <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-demokratia"></a>There is a construction of state power in the opposite direction - from below.</p>

<p>The headquarters representative assured that there is no queue for exchange. Ukrainian is releasing everyone on the least occasion: “We have not yet returned all wounded. That is, if it was the turn, only the wounded and women would still be returned. The dialogue goes not about military units or units, but rather in categories: wounded, sick, elderly, women, places of maintenance. But in fact we return the other. If we insisted on our order of exchange, we would not have been able to liberate more than 2.3 thousand people. A maximum of half a thousand. "</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed what relatives can do to the official confirmation of the captivity of their defenders. In particular, it is necessary to contact the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICCH). Хоча цене гарантує позитивного результату.</p>
<p>«На росіян зараз можна впливати тільки силою. МКЧХ — гуманітарна організація,вона не застосовує силу, а тільки переконання й нагадування. Томупідтвердження залежить від країни-агресорки. Росія зобов’язана підтверджуватиполон людей, яких захопила, й надавати їм відповідні права», — зазначивпредставник Штабу.</p>
<p>Також він запевнив, що всі відео, які викладає ворог з нашими полоненими,беруться в роботу для підтвердження й визволення наших Оборонців: «Миобліковуємо всю інформацію про полонених — у тому числі свідченнях тих, хтоповернувся. Використовуємо все для визволення наших людей».</p>

<p>“The fact that today, after a full -scale invasion of Russia, the possible holding of the International Forum in Lviv means two things. First, the countries of the democratic world still heard our call and supported the Ukrainians in their wake against the latest barbarism, which in neighboring Russia was reborn in a resort and embodied in a totalitarian ideology, which has recently been officially officially named Rashism. Secondly, the fact that in the defense of the values of the democracy of Stalanayai in the world is a group of community of human rights defenders - Armed Forces, ”Olga Mirovich said during the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>She stressed that almost one million men and women of all possible professions: journalists, marketers, IT professionals, teachers, writers, doctors, drivers, builders and other specialists shed blood on the battle Repraints, respect for human rights - from lawlessness, and life - from death. The 59 journalists were killed during the war, which was unleashed by Russia, stressed Mirovich.</p>

In addition, we consider the professional duty of the media and law protection communities to restore justice, forcing those who have spread misinformation and propaganda for years that have prepared a ground for this crime.

<p>This belief was expressed by the expirer of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, expert Frolov during a discussion organized by the German Society of Foreign Policy(DGAP), Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“Freezing conflict is not possible. Ukrainians - both military and politicians, as well as ordinary citizens - understand one thing: we will win or die. Conflict tie will only mean a long, slow dying The sides of our partners, besides, we have been losing people. Freezing conflict is the worst scenario, so no one looks at it, ”Frolova said.</p>
<p>She noted that Ukrainians are ready even for greater victims, but not pre -compromise. The history of 8 years after 2014 showed the futility of the expectations of Narcombr, as it will lead to further conflicts. The expert cited a Daninian survey, when about 96% of respondents said they did not see the possibility for negotiations, for compromises with the Russians. 86% of respondents are negotiated with the aggressor, even with the threat of using it with it.</p>

We have already sacrificed much. These victims should not be in vain, ”Frolova repeated. It is bonar that negotiations can be conducted on topics such as compensation, indemnity and more.</p>
<p>The expert does not agree with the definition of the situation on the front as a "deadlock". "Bakhmut is not a strategic point, it was done by Russian propaganda ... The most strategic issue is huge reserves in the city's city," Frolova joked."There can be very unusual solutions, as Belgorod showed," - said Lyafrolova.</p>
<p>Speaking of Crimea, she noted that with the missiles of a distant radius of action already in the Armed Forces, as well as with the prospect of receiving fighters, Ukraine should have the opportunity to have the Crimean bridge, which will achieve the logistics isolation that will then, in particular, how to reintegrate the territory that has long been completely detached of Ukraine, was added by the expert. According to her, practice shows that the Language troops see the threat of the environment, they try to run, so with the 2 million of the population of the peninsula about 800,000 will try to leave the territory that will resolve the issue of liberation easier.</p>
<p>Frolova also touched on NATO and EU membership.</p>
<p>“After the fighting is completed, Ukraine has a largest, strongest and most talented army on the European continent. It will be a very strange solution to take Ukraine in its bench for NATO, as NATO's capacity has been moving, ”she said. According to the expert, Ukraine is ready to be now in the version of "Finland 2.0" - complete integration into the uses without formal membership.</p>

<p>Frolov also stopped at future relations with the Russian Federation. She sees vast nongs in the fact that the Western powers still fall into the trap, building plans as a "liberal Russia". It could be a big mistake, convinced.</p>
<p>"Russia has never been and will never be liberal," the expert is confident. It proceeds from the fact that plans should be made exclusively on the basis of the fact that Russia will remain in any case an imperial aggressive state, who would not come to power there.</p>

<p>In his opinion, not only the victory of Ukraine in the war, but also the "winning in peace" is important, so the support of partners is essential.</p>

<p>This opinion was expressed by the American philosopher, professor of Stanford University Francis Fukuyama at the Kiev Security Forum, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that a truce and stability without Ukraine's membership in a gracious. Each member <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>, which has to think about this, what a peaceful agreement is possible, so that it is not a simple -flow ceasefire in order for Russia to be re -armed, rebuild its positions, etc., ”Fukuyama said.</p>

<p>“In the future, only the membership of Ukraine Tagrantia, provided for in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, can restrain the war on the part of Russia. Membership in Vitto will be real if, thanks to the counter -offensive, Ukraine returns the Kherson Isaporozhye region on the Black Sea coast. This region is critically important for the negotiation position of Ukraine, ”Fukuyama said.</p>

<p>“We are told: plant aboriginal species. We planted, but in this steppe anything grows!When the steppe was not ruined, there were no grasses, there were no questions, but we were plowing and now there is a powerful agriculture there, so we need to think about these areas, how to work with them!Because we will soon agree to the fact that we will be Ukrainian borscht, because it has solid introductors, ” - said Marchuk.</p>

Я постійно нудила, що давайтетільки без нудних відступів, типу, а зараз, любі читачі, ми вам впакуємо щоськорисне під виглядом чогось красивого. Але ні, там гладенька цікава історія.При цьому в коміксу дві чудових наукових редакторки: Маріана Душар і ОленаБрайченко, з якими ми вели дискусії про солене сало і колір прадавнього квасу.А на одному розвороті можна зустріти знайомих вам людей.

<p>This was stated by the Chairman of the Committee on the Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces Staff, General Mill Millie, according to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“The best and cheapest way to protect the air is from the ground. Integrated air defense systems, which include missiles of different range, is the best way to prevent the dominance in the air of the Russians who have successfully done successfully, ”Millie said.</p>
<p><strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3714223-milli-vpevnenij-so-rosia-ne-vigrae-cu-vijnu.html"><strong> Milli </strong></a>He noted that the F-16 "is not some amazing weapon in the war," the miracle-weapon does not exist.</p>
<p>But the decision to pass the planes to Ukraine has been made after a thorough study of the statement at this time.</p>
<p>According to General, at the beginning of the war, when purely defensive battles were carried out, Ukraine needed the means of protection against armored vehicles that came across the border. And it was such a weapon that was provided.</p>

"This was the result of a careful analysis of risks and the price of the issue, what is needed on the battlefield now and in the near future," - said, adding that the decision was made in close coordination with partners in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He noted that for successful use, for the domination of the air, a significant number of fighters of the 5th generation and everything included in the "Package". Milly drew attention to the price: "We are talking about $ 2 billion for 10 aircraft, Russians have a thousand 5th generation fighters. " It will take time to create full -fledged air forces, he added.</p>
<p>The general also noted that if the question of the transfer of aircraft arose earlier, Ukraine would receive neither BMP nor tanks, because all the money would go to the aircraft. So, he summed up, the partners did the right thing, first passing the NPPO system to deprive the Russian dominance in the air .</p>

<p>This was stated by the mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko during the video address to the participants of the plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions, correspondent.</p>
<p>“You can often hear about a“ road card ”,“ reconstruction plan ”or“ Marshall Plan ”for Ukraine. Many people think about the restoration of houses, bridges and the road. But it's not. The main priority today is to restore the country. Tseosis that the "roadmap" is needed - how to introduce new rules, for Ukraine, to carry out reforms, to turn Ukraine into a state with European standards, ”the mayor of the capital said.</p>
<p>According to him, it is important today to take care of our day after tomorrow: “We have been having a limited time, and we have to succeed, we must remain strong ... Tomorrow when the war is over, we have to implement all these plans. The success of Ukraine is the best answer for our partners. The success of Ukraine is also the best answer for our enemies, for Russia, which understands only language. ”</p>

<p>Klitschko recalled that decentralization reform has been one of the most successful reforms in Ukraine over the past years, and it is the basis for the stability of the country and democracy. These achievements should not be lost even in the war, when certain politicians try to build vertical power of the surrounding power, while the main principle <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-demokratia"></a>There is a construction of state power in the opposite direction - from below.</p>
<p>The capital chairman appealed to the European Committee of Regions to support such reforms, in cooperation with key partners, since it will be much more difficult to build renewed Ukraine without their help.</p>

<p>“May 25, Avdiivka. I am on the ruins of two houses - a five -storey -storey -storey one that has been struck. Unfortunately, two civilians are under the same, people were unambiguously driven.

<p>“Unfortunately, this does not greatly encourage the locals to evacuate. I would like to take a second time to evacuate. For, even if a person survives under such assaults, we are unlikely to be able to get them, because there is no special equipment in the city to disassemble these blockages, ”Barabash emphasized.</p>
<p>He added that it is impossible to risk the lives of SES fighters, who will simply be missing in Avdiivka, because 20-25 kilometers of the road to the city are constantly subtracted.</p>

Therefore, it is necessary to not wait and not wait ...

It is dangerous to send search groups there before carrying out the appropriate preparation procedures. He added that the office receives an information about the probable places of burials from various sources: both Vrivka, from the police, and from the local population.</p>
<p>As for the information about the directions from which the bodies of the dead soldiers return, Mr Angelin noted that representatives of the Russian side provide very generally information about it, so it is difficult to find out which location has returned from our defenders. The final confirmation is given by the already relevant expertise. He also urged his relatives to pass to the office to know information about the probable places of disappearance of servicemen.</p>

And it was the determination of the main directions in the defense sector that was devoted to the largest conference of the state and Eastern Europe_ <em>defence</em> <em>24</em> <em>day</em> _ <em>, which took place in the capital of Warsaw.</em></p>
<p>It is a matter of mind that, given the desperate and bloody struggle, our country will now be with Russian aggressors, the main attention of participants in the international conference was attracted to issues related to the heroic opposing Ukrainian people. And in this sense, our foreign partners were very interesting and relevant to hear the opinion and specific meaningful proposals of the Deputy Aminist of Ukraine's Defense Anna Malyar._</p>
<h3><strong> About "Antipytinists" and hybrid effects on the part of the Russians </strong></h3>
<p>In her opinion, the result of Russian aggression against free and independent Ukraine was the very fact that the so -called Eastern neighbor could not have managed to give in the spirit of imperialism. And, despite the fact that more than 30 years of moving to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Empires can still not be reconciled with this objective historical fact, Ukraine consider Ukraine the best of the former USSR and through its conquest try to restore their unobstructed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49.jpeg" />According to Anna Malyar, in her desire of the Russian Federation uses any methods, in particular, trying to influence Europeans through financing political parties.Of course, in her speech, Anna Malyar not only stated the fact of one of the deputies by the Russian Federation. First of all, she reminded the participants of the conference that in the European countries and in America and in the Ukrainian Ukrainians, the so -called experts who allegedly opposed Putin have been growing and funding for years, and now, when the Warning War was ongoing, they have stood on its side and for some reason. At the same time, the trust of millions of citizens. Therefore, in her opinion, that Russia could not use this hybrid information instrument of influence through free access to the information space with developed democracy, the Western world must be as much as possible and consolidated in the fight against totalitarian Russia and not allow it to be possible.</p>
<h3><strong> About the phenomenon of Ukrainian force </strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/03_ukr-scaled.jpg" />Photo: Poglyad.tv</p>
<p>As for the very fact of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, as the Deputy Minister of Defense emphasized, such a step is different, as a great foolishness from the Russians, it is impossible to call. After all, since 2014, when fighting against Russian invaders in the east of our country began, the Ukrainian army gained enormous combat experience. It is to break the enemy from such adventure and madness, and the Ukrainians were convinced that the Russians were well aware that we cannot be overcome that we would still win them.</p>
<p>“They would have first remembered our history. For example, in the same Soviet prisoners, the vast majority of political prisoners were Ukrainians who have not been not free from the totalitarian Soviet system for all over 70 years of its existence and proved by their struggle that we were not slaves. However, there was a very terrible war that could never be imagined and that it was impossible to prepare for people who are not some savages but bearers and civilization. Today, Ukraine is the object. Our warriors are hardened by the poor with Russia. And the phenomenon of the strength of Ukrainians consists of a whole complex of different manifestations, factors and circumstances, - said Anna Malyar.</p>
<h3><strong> About the President, Government and Departure from Bureaucracy </strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.50.jpeg" />- I have repeatedly witnessed the casual situation with the warriors on the front line. And after that, people with more inspiration will fight the enemy. It was the first at the beginning of a large -scale Russian invasion at the beginning of a large -scale invasion, which inspired all the Ukrainians to fight the aggressor, - said Anna Malyar.</p>
<h3><strong> About the Defenders of Ukraine and the historical chance to win Russia </strong></h3>
<p>It is indisputable to the very fact that even before the start of a large -scale war, the Ukrainian army served powerful vocational military service, many of which were trained in NATO standards. But the Great Invasion requires constant replenishment of human resources. Today in the trenches near Bakhmut and other areas of the Russian-Ukrainian Fronte are representatives of many purely civilian professions-farmers, doctors of sciences, business owners, singers ...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/e2teus-c4x3x50px50p-c4x3x50px50p-9e8d88dd767753d844f8f51373962f03.jpg" />- In general, these are hundreds of thousands of mobilized persons. And today they all bring them together, everywhere we all have a historical chance to put a point in this 400 years of war. As they say, now we have all the stars. There is a powerful army, there are no political strife that have always destroyed our country, and we finally managed to unblood the subversive activities of Russian special services, ”Anna Malyar said.</p>
<p>In her opinion, such unity, as now, has never been to counteract Russia. Israz together we pass that historical peak, when a real chansous jerk appeared to finally end this country with the aggressor. All the prerequisites for this. There is no one to be afraid. For example, the Ukrainian military leadership is much more professional than Russian. We plan combat operations according to modern standards, and they - by the old Soviet ones. We also have the bureaucracy of the VSKskaya less and much more freedom to make decisions by representatives of the team units.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the Russians have already realized it, and they try to change something in this direction, but they do not succeed, - stated the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> About our unity and Russian narratives </strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49-2.jpeg" />- For example, the Russians have seen how powerful in these difficult times the Poland helps Ukraine and how strategically it strengthens us with you. But for them, Dobrostidu partner Polish-Ukrainian relations are a threat. Through the tevons, any methods are used to quarrel our multimillion innasters. For example, they begin to say that the Poles are not satisfied with the behavior of Ukrainians who went to Poland through the war. In response to the same social networks, a Ukrainian may be unpleasant to the Poles. That is, Russia launches narratives that can adjust us against each other. In particular, they also dive into expert discussions about our past and try to state that we have become antagonists again. That is, they work through social, because it is the driving force of power. But Ukrainians have become much more in the information space, understanding how Russian propaganda operates and do not believe in these narratives. And it is very important that the Poles are well aware. Our main task is to be stable in this information space and to constantly explain to people so that they do not perceive the props. We are friendly peoples and together we are strong!- said Hannamal.</p>
<h3><strong> About Bakhmut's Defense and Release of Territories </strong></h3>
<p>During the International Conference on Defense and Security, the Deputy Ministry of Defense of Ukraine also spoke with representatives of the media. Of course, all the journalists were interested in the issue of counter -confronted and defense actions by Ukrainian defense forces.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/bachmutas-92544239.jpg" />Photo: AP / Scanpix</p>
<p>In this context, Anna Malyar explained that in general, from the beginner -scale Russian invasion, our country is in a defense state, which in turn includes various measures. And if in the east, Ukrainian military is mainly defended against the Russian invasion, then the other areas carry out active assault and offensive actions.</p>
<p>According to her, the defense of Bakhmut remains a separate and heroic page of the up -to -date history of Ukraine and the most expensive battle for Russian invaders, which have suffered great losses in weapons, equipment and personnel.She also stressed that the Bakhmut battle allowed Ukrainians to solve several martial tasks. In particular, thanks to the defense of the city, it has been struck from the summer of last year, it was possible to cause great losses of the enemy and divided one of his most professional groups among the mercenaries of the Wagner PEC. And secondly, it made it possible to reduce the offensive potential of the Russians, who, having concentrated their efforts there, could not use it on other preferences.</p>
<p>"In general, we do not divide our lands" more important. " For us, each of its kilometer is native and strategically important, because our ultimate goal is to slow down all temporarily occupied territories. Therefore, of course, we will only move forward, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<h3><strong> About the need for weapons and hostile missile attacks </strong></h3>
<p>At the same time, many weapons are needed to accelerate this process. And, answering the questions of journalists, Anna Malyar said that among the priorities - to obtain a modern long -range weapons about the number of Russia, unfortunately, today there is still an advantage.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49-3.jpeg" />In addition, she said, today the Russians are able to launch missiles of the fortune of the territory of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>And such rockets are a hundred a day. To close the sky and protect civilians, we need powerful anti -missile complexes and modern combat aviation, which will allow us to break the course of the war. And we will be very grateful for providing such necessary help, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> About Poland that is known in trouble and joint counteraction to the aggressor </strong></h3>
<p>Of course, both in this and in the humanitarian aspects, Ukraine greatly appreciates the assistance of the parties of many European countries and is gratefully grateful for this to such a large -scale and strategic partner as Poland.</p>

<p>We fight for the Alliance. We fight for ours and your freedom.</p>
<p>There are those by whom Ukraine exists, fights, wins. There are those who protect NATO, there are those who protect all of us - Ukrainian soldiers, armed forces.</p>

<p>“We owed to the present. Those who were murdered in Irpen, Bucha and Mariupol.</p>
<p>Debt can be paid in one way - to become a member of NATO.</p>
<p>We owed stories - to those who fought for Ukraine to be independent, fought in enslaved Europe under Soviet occupation. This will be due to the expansion and expansion of world democracy.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T82-00-00-04-00/llojd-ostin.jpg" />US Defense Minister Lloyd J. Austin III, Head of the United States Committee on US Army Army Mark A. Millie and US Defense Minister Assist agencies of more than 50-Typads from all over the world in online format in Pentagon, Washington, District of Columbia, May 25, 2023, during which they discussed the continuous war of Russia in Ukraine in Ukraine further close coordination to provide the Ukrainian people with the means necessary to protect their sovereign territory.</p>
<p>"Hello to everyone. Thank you that we have joined us virtually from all time zones.</p>
<p>Since Ukraine is moving in the fight against Russian invaders, members of this contact group are the only ones. After the meeting of this group last month, the United States allocated an additional $ 1.8 billion to Ukrainian Security Aid.</p>
<p>This includes a recent package of $ 375 million with such Himars, anti -tank systems and laser missiles. We also provide key combat tools, such as transportation of heavy equipment Table bridge systems.</p>
<p>And in our last package of security assistance to Ukraine, the combination of America has financed additional anti -air defense systems of the camp. This package also includes equipment that will combine outdated Ukraine's prototype defense systems with the launching installations of the air defense, missiles and radars of members of this contact group.</p>
<p>We also provide more than 155 mm artillery shells, as well as increase training, maintenance and maintenance. We are concentrating a contribution that makes real changes in real time.</p>
<p>However, the United States is also dedicated to the long -term support of Ukraine. The Ukrainian ones that have come together today as well. We cooperate with all of you to give the defenders and defenders of Ukraine what they need when they need.</p>
<p>Several members of the contact group have recently made important ads.Denmark also announced a significant new package. It includes remedies for protruding defense and combat tools such as mine machines, mobile field bridges and evacuation machines.</p>
<p>France has also identified more light tanks and armored vehicles.</p>
<p>All these donations meet Ukraine's primary requirements and reflect the determination of this contact group.</p>
<p>Together, members of the contact group provided the Ukrainian soldiers with the necessary preparation. We have prepared motorized and mechanized crews, continuing to carry out collective preparation of Ukrainian combat units.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, 31 M1 Abrams tank from the United States arrived in Unime.</p>
<p>Last week, US President Joseph Biden announced that the United States would support joint efforts with our allies and partners to prepare Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16. We hope that this training will begin in the coming weeks. This will further strengthen and improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian air forces in the long run. And this will supplement our co -resistant and medium -term safety agreements.</p>
<p>These new joint efforts send a powerful message about our unity and ovary devotion of Ukraine's self -defense. And this again testifies to the main determination to ensure that sovereign and safe Ukraine Moglast hold any future aggression and defend itself against future attacks.</p>
<p>You can see this dedication in our work on the most important potential that is now given by the contact group: terrestrial air defense systems. These are critically important systems protect the Ukrainian sky and civilian infrastructure from the attack of Russia. And we continue to deliver the needed trips.</p>
<p>In total, the contact group has allocated almost $ 65 billion for a security assistance. Now Putin hoped that our determination would disappear. And he staged that our unity would crack. Instead, we remain uniform as Iranian. And it can see the whole world. Now everyone here knows what Ukrainians reached. Russia has resumed its shocking and shameful flurry of racketees, which threaten innocent Ukrainian civilians, including hypersonic missiles aimed at Kiev.Russia was unable to dominate the Ukrainian airspace. And that is why the air defense will be again at the center of our dysfunctions. As always, our good friend Alexei Reznikov and his team join us. Alexei, thank you that we have taken time to inform us about Ukraine's priority needs for future struggle.</p>
<p>Then the commander of the European Command of the US Armed Forces and the security group of Ukraine will inform us about Ukraine's closest requirements. And we will solve the ways of further acceleration of industrial production of critical systems. We will have to dig deeper and we will have to continue to find creative ways to increase our industrial potential.</p>
<p>The rates are high. But the reason is fair. And our will is strong. We continue to build a sovereign right of Ukraine to live in freedom. We continue to intensify the open world of rules and rights. And we will defend the free sustive Ukraine as much as it will be needed, "said Lloyd Austin.</p>

<p>Anthony Ebbot noted that if Russian President Vladimir Putin knew that the free world would help Ukraine, he would not dare to start a wide -scale invasion.</p>
<ul>
<li>We all want peace, but there can be no long peace without the victory of Ukraine. Gentiles do bad things, do evil, and think they will be unpunished. That is why Putin attacked Ukraine. He believed that he would pass and he would have a slight victory, - said Ebbott.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, after the war, Putin was very miscalculated.</p>
<p>-Putin did not understand that, first, the armed forces and the people of Ukraine would stand up to fight. And, secondly, the free countries of the free world will be ready to help Ukraine and support the Ukrainian people. All countries in Europe staggered this criminal, as if 5 NATO Article was launched. And peace can only be achieved if NATO guarantees safety, - he said.</p>
<p>Anthony Ebbott also stressed that all civilized countries demonstrate a solidarity with the Ukrainian people and expressed confidence in the victory of Ukraine.</p>

They are not preparing for the Litholympic Games in Paris, but save their country and the democratic world of the districting totalitarian regime.</p>

<p>Instead, Russia and Belarus continue to prepare athletes to also challenge the civilized world in 2024.</p>
<p>The fact that the terrorist country manages to constantly find "useful idiots" or corrupt officials that help her promote the cannibal ideas and traditions of the International Arena, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verkhovna.rada.ukraine/posts/pfbid02rjWCb2PsEHrWPT7zLNvNC2iMs35MjCCbaMEbL89pSMVjtSyP9qTFDc1Sv6LQb39el">says</a>In a message on the official page of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Facebook.</p>
<p>“In the International Olympic Committee, they forgot about humanity and are massively brought to the competitions of athletes who receive salaries in the Russian Defense Ministry, promote war and murder. Ukrainian sports - flash and dignity!” - representatives of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of Youth and Sports Write.</p>
<p>On the page, they placed a short film \ #boycottrussiansport, which clearly demonstrates the insidiousness of the racists, neglect of ethical and moral laws based on nobility, justice and honor in sports.</p>

<p>[Wrote] about it(https://twitter.com/aliciakearns/status/1661787913644830720)In his Twitter, a member of the Conservative Party Pauline Letham.</p>
<ul>
<li>We hope that this will somehow help to honor the memory of millions of Ukrainians who are starved. We are standing with our friends in Ukraine, ”Polym Latham.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was today that she introduced the appropriate <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-05-25/debates/6EC6E8AD-56E4-44BF-A0DC-1E077B9ED2E9/UkrainianHolodomor">resolution</a>In the lower house of the UK Parliament, the House of Commons, which unanimously decided to recognize the famine of 1932-1933 by the genocide of the Ukrainian Narode.</p>
<p>Before the debate, Polym Letham congratulated the ambassador of Ukraine to Vadim Prystayk in the parliament of Ukraine and emphasized that the famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s was artificial, caused by the forced selection of harvesting from Ukrainian peasants.</p>
<ul>
<li>90 years ago, in the spring of 1933, millions of Ukrainians died of famine. However, there was no natural famine in Ukraine. The grain was plenty of grain, but all this was laid with incredibly high bread tariffs of Moscow. At that time, Moskva exported millions of tons of grain to the west until the Ukrainians were dying of the Putstalin violent famine. The word "famine" means death by hunger, and this is exactly what the USSR has done in Ukraine. I will come to the horrific details of famine, but when discussing genocide, it is also important to understand the context and motivation of the USSR in Moscow, - the parliamentarian said.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also compared those events with the present, when Russia has stolen Ukrainian in temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.<strong> Reference </strong>: As of 2023, the Holodomor has officially recognized the genocide -Ukrainian people over 20 countries of the world. In particular, on March 10, 2023, Belgium recognized the Holodomor of 1932-1933 by the genocide of the Ukrainian people. The Parliament of Iceland recognized the Holodomor on March 23, as the genocide of the Ukrainian people. On May 23, Slovenia Parliament supported the recognition of the 1932-1933 famine by the genocide of the Ukrainian Narode.</p>
