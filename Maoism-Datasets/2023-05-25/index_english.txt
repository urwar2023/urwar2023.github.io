As reports The Press Center of the Economy of Ukraine, this was discussed during the meeting of the First Viceremier-Minister of Ukraine-Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Sviridenko with a constant coordinator of the UN system in Ukraine and humanitarian-friendly coordinator Deniz Brown.
“The result of a large -scale invasion of Russia was the destruction of production chains and capacity, locking logistics routes. In addition, Ukraine is doing everything to provide food to the countries that are extremely extremely drawn. Grain initiative is being implemented by the Grain Corridor today, more than 30 million tons of agricultural products have been sent. The humanitarian initiative of President Vladimir Zelensky Grain from Ukraine has world support, aimed at preventing a famine in the poorest countries and Asia. Ukraine is responsible for its mission to ensure the food security in the world and seeks to increase its role. Therefore, one of the key obstacles to this is the large -scale pollution of the territory of Ukraine with explosive objects, ”Yulia Sviridenko said.
The First Viceremier-Minister of Ukraine-Minister of Economy of Ukraine emphasized that about 174 thousand square kilometers, or about 30% of the territory of Ukraine, are potentially potential polluted. This area is a source of food for about 81 million people around the world.

 About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar wrote In telegrams.
“More than a year of full -scale war.
The enormous path of vaccination from Russian infovids has been traveled. We learned to cut and feel even between the lines of their insidiousness.
It seemed that this rule already subconsciously works for everyone - we believe in official sources.
We do not believe the impersonal sources of information - when there is neither a name nor a name of the Institution, nor other identifying features. When you just don't know who exactly has written.
But the larger the beacon, the more they believe.
The Russians write in telegrams that have happened to our Glavcom.
And what? Well, let them write.
We have denied it - repeatedly. He does his job. And he does not bypass fakes, as well as other commander, whose enemies write fictions.
We do not substitute doubles.
The Russians just test their IPSO. "

“The fact that today, after a full -scale invasion of Russia, the possible holding of the International Forum in Lviv means two things.

 The freezing of the conflict is the worst scenario for Ukraine, as it will mean that the state will not be able to develop normally and numerous casualties were in vain.
This belief was expressed by the expirer of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, expert Frolov during a discussion organized by the German Society of Foreign Policy(DGAP), Ukrinform correspondent reports.
“Freezing conflict is not possible. Ukrainians - both military and politicians, as well as ordinary citizens - understand one thing: we will win or die. Conflict tie will only mean a long, slow dying The sides of our partners, besides, we have been losing people. Freezing conflict is the worst scenario, so no one looks at it, ”Frolova said.
She noted that Ukrainians are ready even for greater victims, but not pre -compromise. The history of 8 years after 2014 showed the futility of the expectations of Narcombr, as it will lead to further conflicts. The expert cited a Daninian survey, when about 96% of respondents said they did not see the possibility for negotiations, for compromises with the Russians. 86% of respondents are negotiated with the aggressor, even with the threat of using it with it.

The expert does not agree with the definition of the situation on the front as a "deadlock". "Bakhmut is not a strategic point, it was done by Russian propaganda ... The most strategic issue is huge reserves in the city's city," Frolova joked."There can be very unusual solutions, as Belgorod showed," - said Lyafrolova.
Speaking of Crimea, she noted that with the missiles of a distant radius of action already in the Armed Forces, as well as with the prospect of receiving fighters, Ukraine should have the opportunity to have the Crimean bridge, which will achieve the logistics isolation that will then, in particular, how to reintegrate the territory that has long been completely detached of Ukraine, was added by the expert. According to her, practice shows that the Language troops see the threat of the environment, they try to run, so with the 2 million of the population of the peninsula about 800,000 will try to leave the territory that will resolve the issue of liberation easier.
Frolova also touched on NATO and EU membership.
“After the fighting is completed, Ukraine has a largest, strongest and most talented army on the European continent. It will be a very strange solution to take Ukraine in its bench for NATO, as NATO's capacity has been moving, ”she said. According to the expert, Ukraine is ready to be now in the version of "Finland 2.0" - complete integration into the uses without formal membership.
Read also: freeze As for the EU, it will benefit from Ukraine's membership, but it must be noted that Ukraine has the potential for rapid growth, that the money that the EU is now will be investments, not grants.

"Russia has never been and will never be liberal," the expert is confident. It proceeds from the fact that plans should be made exclusively on the basis of the fact that Russia will remain in any case an imperial aggressive state, who would not come to power there.

 The background of large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine was more relevant about building a strong European-Atlantic security architecture. And it was the determination of the main directions in the defense sector that was devoted to the largest conference of the state and Eastern Europe_ defence 24 day _ , which took place in the capital of Warsaw. 
It is a matter of mind that, given the desperate and bloody struggle, our country will now be with Russian aggressors, the main attention of participants in the international conference was attracted to issues related to the heroic opposing Ukrainian people. And in this sense, our foreign partners were very interesting and relevant to hear the opinion and specific meaningful proposals of the Deputy Aminist of Ukraine's Defense Anna Malyar._
About "Antipytinists" and hybrid effects on the part of the Russians 
In her opinion, the result of Russian aggression against free and independent Ukraine was the very fact that the so -called Eastern neighbor could not have managed to give in the spirit of imperialism. And, despite the fact that more than 30 years of moving to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Empires can still not be reconciled with this objective historical fact, Ukraine consider Ukraine the best of the former USSR and through its conquest try to restore their unobstructed.
 According to Anna Malyar, in her desire of the Russian Federation uses any methods, in particular, trying to influence Europeans through financing political parties.Of course, in her speech, Anna Malyar not only stated the fact of one of the deputies by the Russian Federation. First of all, she reminded the participants of the conference that in the European countries and in America and in the Ukrainian Ukrainians, the so -called experts who allegedly opposed Putin have been growing and funding for years, and now, when the Warning War was ongoing, they have stood on its side and for some reason. At the same time, the trust of millions of citizens. Therefore, in her opinion, that Russia could not use this hybrid information instrument of influence through free access to the information space with developed democracy, the Western world must be as much as possible and consolidated in the fight against totalitarian Russia and not allow it to be possible.
About the phenomenon of Ukrainian force 
 Photo: Poglyad.tv
As for the very fact of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, as the Deputy Minister of Defense emphasized, such a step is different, as a great foolishness from the Russians, it is impossible to call. After all, since 2014, when fighting against Russian invaders in the east of our country began, the Ukrainian army gained enormous combat experience. It is to break the enemy from such adventure and madness, and the Ukrainians were convinced that the Russians were well aware that we cannot be overcome that we would still win them.
“They would have first remembered our history. For example, in the same Soviet prisoners, the vast majority of political prisoners were Ukrainians who have not been not free from the totalitarian Soviet system for all over 70 years of its existence and proved by their struggle that we were not slaves. However, there was a very terrible war that could never be imagined and that it was impossible to prepare for people who are not some savages but bearers and civilization. Today, Ukraine is the object. Our warriors are hardened by the poor with Russia. And the phenomenon of the strength of Ukrainians consists of a whole complex of different manifestations, factors and circumstances, - said Anna Malyar.
About the President, Government and Departure from Bureaucracy 
 - I have repeatedly witnessed the casual situation with the warriors on the front line. And after that, people with more inspiration will fight the enemy. It was the first at the beginning of a large -scale Russian invasion at the beginning of a large -scale invasion, which inspired all the Ukrainians to fight the aggressor, - said Anna Malyar.
About the Defenders of Ukraine and the historical chance to win Russia 
It is indisputable to the very fact that even before the start of a large -scale war, the Ukrainian army served powerful vocational military service, many of which were trained in NATO standards. But the Great Invasion requires constant replenishment of human resources. Today in the trenches near Bakhmut and other areas of the Russian-Ukrainian Fronte are representatives of many purely civilian professions-farmers, doctors of sciences, business owners, singers ...
 - In general, these are hundreds of thousands of mobilized persons. And today they all bring them together, everywhere we all have a historical chance to put a point in this 400 years of war. As they say, now we have all the stars. There is a powerful army, there are no political strife that have always destroyed our country, and we finally managed to unblood the subversive activities of Russian special services, ”Anna Malyar said.
In her opinion, such unity, as now, has never been to counteract Russia. Israz together we pass that historical peak, when a real chansous jerk appeared to finally end this country with the aggressor. All the prerequisites for this. There is no one to be afraid. For example, the Ukrainian military leadership is much more professional than Russian. We plan combat operations according to modern standards, and they - by the old Soviet ones. We also have the bureaucracy of the VSKskaya less and much more freedom to make decisions by representatives of the team units.
About our unity and Russian narratives 
 - For example, the Russians have seen how powerful in these difficult times the Poland helps Ukraine and how strategically it strengthens us with you. But for them, Dobrostidu partner Polish-Ukrainian relations are a threat. Through the tevons, any methods are used to quarrel our multimillion innasters. For example, they begin to say that the Poles are not satisfied with the behavior of Ukrainians who went to Poland through the war. In response to the same social networks, a Ukrainian may be unpleasant to the Poles. That is, Russia launches narratives that can adjust us against each other. In particular, they also dive into expert discussions about our past and try to state that we have become antagonists again. That is, they work through social, because it is the driving force of power. But Ukrainians have become much more in the information space, understanding how Russian propaganda operates and do not believe in these narratives. And it is very important that the Poles are well aware. Our main task is to be stable in this information space and to constantly explain to people so that they do not perceive the props. We are friendly peoples and together we are strong!- said Hannamal.
About Bakhmut's Defense and Release of Territories 
During the International Conference on Defense and Security, the Deputy Ministry of Defense of Ukraine also spoke with representatives of the media. Of course, all the journalists were interested in the issue of counter -confronted and defense actions by Ukrainian defense forces.

In this context, Anna Malyar explained that in general, from the beginner -scale Russian invasion, our country is in a defense state, which in turn includes various measures. And if in the east, Ukrainian military is mainly defended against the Russian invasion, then the other areas carry out active assault and offensive actions.
According to her, the defense of Bakhmut remains a separate and heroic page of the up -to -date history of Ukraine and the most expensive battle for Russian invaders, which have suffered great losses in weapons, equipment and personnel.She also stressed that the Bakhmut battle allowed Ukrainians to solve several martial tasks. In particular, thanks to the defense of the city, it has been struck from the summer of last year, it was possible to cause great losses of the enemy and divided one of his most professional groups among the mercenaries of the Wagner PEC. And secondly, it made it possible to reduce the offensive potential of the Russians, who, having concentrated their efforts there, could not use it on other preferences.
"In general, we do not divide our lands" more important. " For us, each of its kilometer is native and strategically important, because our ultimate goal is to slow down all temporarily occupied territories. Therefore, of course, we will only move forward, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.
About the need for weapons and hostile missile attacks 
At the same time, many weapons are needed to accelerate this process. And, answering the questions of journalists, Anna Malyar said that among the priorities - to obtain a modern long -range weapons about the number of Russia, unfortunately, today there is still an advantage.
 In addition, she said, today the Russians are able to launch missiles of the fortune of the territory of Ukraine.
About Poland that is known in trouble and joint counteraction to the aggressor 
Of course, both in this and in the humanitarian aspects, Ukraine greatly appreciates the assistance of the parties of many European countries and is gratefully grateful for this to such a large -scale and strategic partner as Poland.

Millie and US Defense Minister Assist agencies of more than 50-Typads from all over the world in online format in Pentagon, Washington, District of Columbia, May 25, 2023, during which they discussed the continuous war of Russia in Ukraine in Ukraine further close coordination to provide the Ukrainian people with the means necessary to protect their sovereign territory.
"Hello to everyone. Thank you that we have joined us virtually from all time zones.
Since Ukraine is moving in the fight against Russian invaders, members of this contact group are the only ones. After the meeting of this group last month, the United States allocated an additional $ 1.8 billion to Ukrainian Security Aid.
This includes a recent package of $ 375 million with such Himars, anti -tank systems and laser missiles. We also provide key combat tools, such as transportation of heavy equipment Table bridge systems.
And in our last package of security assistance to Ukraine, the combination of America has financed additional anti -air defense systems of the camp. This package also includes equipment that will combine outdated Ukraine's prototype defense systems with the launching installations of the air defense, missiles and radars of members of this contact group.
We also provide more than 155 mm artillery shells, as well as increase training, maintenance and maintenance. We are concentrating a contribution that makes real changes in real time.
However, the United States is also dedicated to the long -term support of Ukraine. The Ukrainian ones that have come together today as well. We cooperate with all of you to give the defenders and defenders of Ukraine what they need when they need.
Several members of the contact group have recently made important ads.Denmark also announced a significant new package. It includes remedies for protruding defense and combat tools such as mine machines, mobile field bridges and evacuation machines.
France has also identified more light tanks and armored vehicles.
All these donations meet Ukraine's primary requirements and reflect the determination of this contact group.
Together, members of the contact group provided the Ukrainian soldiers with the necessary preparation. We have prepared motorized and mechanized crews, continuing to carry out collective preparation of Ukrainian combat units.
Earlier this month, 31 M1 Abrams tank from the United States arrived in Unime.
Last week, US President Joseph Biden announced that the United States would support joint efforts with our allies and partners to prepare Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16. We hope that this training will begin in the coming weeks. This will further strengthen and improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian air forces in the long run. And this will supplement our co -resistant and medium -term safety agreements.
These new joint efforts send a powerful message about our unity and ovary devotion of Ukraine's self -defense. And this again testifies to the main determination to ensure that sovereign and safe Ukraine Moglast hold any future aggression and defend itself against future attacks.
You can see this dedication in our work on the most important potential that is now given by the contact group: terrestrial air defense systems. These are critically important systems protect the Ukrainian sky and civilian infrastructure from the attack of Russia. And we continue to deliver the needed trips.
In total, the contact group has allocated almost $ 65 billion for a security assistance. Now Putin hoped that our determination would disappear. And he staged that our unity would crack. Instead, we remain uniform as Iranian. And it can see the whole world. Now everyone here knows what Ukrainians reached. Russia has resumed its shocking and shameful flurry of racketees, which threaten innocent Ukrainian civilians, including hypersonic missiles aimed at Kiev.Russia was unable to dominate the Ukrainian airspace. And that is why the air defense will be again at the center of our dysfunctions. As always, our good friend Alexei Reznikov and his team join us. Alexei, thank you that we have taken time to inform us about Ukraine's priority needs for future struggle.
Then the commander of the European Command of the US Armed Forces and the security group of Ukraine will inform us about Ukraine's closest requirements. And we will solve the ways of further acceleration of industrial production of critical systems. We will have to dig deeper and we will have to continue to find creative ways to increase our industrial potential.
The rates are high. But the reason is fair. And our will is strong. We continue to build a sovereign right of Ukraine to live in freedom. We continue to intensify the open world of rules and rights. And we will defend the free sustive Ukraine as much as it will be needed, "said Lloyd Austin.

Instead, Russia and Belarus continue to prepare athletes to also challenge the civilized world in 2024.
The fact that the terrorist country manages to constantly find "useful idiots" or corrupt officials that help her promote the cannibal ideas and traditions of the International Arena, says In a message on the official page of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Facebook.
“In the International Olympic Committee, they forgot about humanity and are massively brought to the competitions of athletes who receive salaries in the Russian Defense Ministry, promote war and murder. Ukrainian sports - flash and dignity!” - representatives of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of Youth and Sports Write.
On the page, they placed a short film \ #boycottrussiansport, which clearly demonstrates the insidiousness of the racists, neglect of ethical and moral laws based on nobility, justice and honor in sports.
