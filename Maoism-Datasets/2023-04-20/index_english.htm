Representatives of the Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Veterans, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Health Service of Ukraine were enlightened. About it <a href="https://www.rada.gov.ua/news/news_kom/235524.html">reports</a>Press service of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The consideration of the control issue was chaired by the first deputy chairman of the committee of Mikhail Tsymbalyuk. "The issue of the functioning of hospitals of war, the provision of medical services to veterans of war remains relevant and needs detailed discussion," Mr Tsymbalyuk said. "It is important first of all to establish how hospitals of wars and other military meters in the period of martial law work, problems that arise in their work and proposals in the development of a single state policy in this direction in this direction, after our victory."</p>
<p>In their speeches, government representatives reported on the activities of subordinate rehabilitation centers and their own/interagency experience in the sphererirebilitation.</p>
<p>The first was heard by the speech of the Minister of Social Policy Olenikulchytska, who emphasized the support of the Ministry of Initiatives of the Ministry of Health on the introduction of a multidisciplinary approach in the process of rehabilitation of citizens both from civilians and from the military. There are 2 multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams with 5 social workers. “The full range of service rehabilitation is provided both inpatient and outpatient. The institution also employs the VLK, which will exhibit appropriate conclusions about the need to continue rehabilitation or prosthetics, - said the Minister of Social Policy. - the construction of information exchanges between the electronic security system, the "rehabilitation module" and the only information systems of the social system, in particular, the centralized bank on the issues of disistantability, is now being deployed. This will simplify and accelerate the document circulation on providing and financial services. ”Separately, the People's Deputies of Ukraine - members of the Committee discussed the possibilities of providing social services in the communities at the expense of the state budget. The corresponding project of the Law is already discussed in the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Upon reaching the position of ministries, the bill will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The People's Deputy of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko drew the attention of participants of the meeting to the problem of the problem of improper condition of a number of military hospitals and needy institutions in repair work. It also noted the need of district doctor in the "rehabilitation packages" of the National Health Service of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In his turn, the First Deputy Minister of Health Sergey Dubrov noted that those health care institutions that enter into contracts by the Special Health Service of Ukraine are financial. "They are developing, these establishments are purchased equipment and repairs," Mr Dubrov reported. "We have quite large balances that exceed 150 millions in the accounts of institutions."</p>
<p>The Head of the National Health Service of Ukraine Natalia Husak also assured the participants of the meeting, that the funds paid by the NSA for health care for war veterans of war are sufficient to ensure the free provision of medical services, payment of salaries to doctors and health care providers, as well as for the development of relevant institutions. “In 2023, we significantly raised the rehab. At present, one person is ready to pay 33,600 hryvnias a month for inpatient comprehensive rehabilitation, if, of course, the institution meets certain conditions. It is also the presence of an interdisciplinary team, special equipment, compliance with requirements and standards in the recovery of a person, ”the goose said.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of hospitals of war veterans are in the territories of active fighting. Therefore, individual services and long -term treatment in such establishments, due to the safety conditions, cannot be gained. "The relevant institutions of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions were mispated by a special package, which allows them to protect the amount of funding at the level last year," Natalia Husak said the Chief Health Service of Ukraine. "This makes it possible to protect the staffing potential for medical care in the future."Returning to the speeches of government representatives, the First Deputy Minister of Health Sergey Dubrov reported that as of April 7, 2023, the traveling of 25 subordinate hospitals of war veterans has 3,000 medical workers. “The hospitals are on the balance of local councils. Two - in the balance sheet. Hospital veterans of the war are contracting on a general basis, according to the packages of providing medical care to which they answer, ”Mr Dubrov. -To the TOP-3 packages of providing medical care in 2023 are rehabilitation assistance to adults and children in hospital. We will understand about the need to expand psychological and rehabilitation assistance to war veterans. "</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health also emphasized the expansion of the Affordable Medicines Program, which enables every Ukrainian, including war veteran, to get a number of medicines for free or for a small payment. Currently, there are 486 medicines. “Now we develop providing for palliative patients of narcotic analgesics. In the second half of this year, such narcotic analgesics as fentanyl plastic strips will be introduced, ”Sergey Dubrov summarized.</p>
<p>In their turn, the Ministry of Veterans informed the desire to take responsibility for providing war veterans with a psychological aid. According to Tatiana Kalita, the Deputy Ministry of Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization, the Ministry has separate funding for psychological assistance. “We ask the MOH to unlock the soullessness to give it.

<p>The letter was released on <a href="https://www.lee.senate.gov/services/files/582D6601-A680-45A0-90E4-A92E91B4E2B3"></a>, Senator Mike Lee, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"We are deeply concerned about the fact that the US assistance trajectory with military efforts <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina"></a>It is threatened with further escalation and there is no need for strategic clarity, ”the letter reads.</p>
<p>The text states that the war has been going on for the second year, and still "it is not visible", as well as, they say, there is no clear strategy for its completion.</p>
<p>"Proxy with Russia in Ukraine does not correspond to the strategic interests of the state and risks escalation that can get out of control," the signatories said.</p>
<p>Republicans accused Biden's administration of "a long conflict set" and stated that the current strategy of sanctions against Russia, as well as allocating assistance to Ukraine, would only delay it. They called assistance to "unlimited" and stated that it should be stopped, otherwise, in a word, there is a growing risk of direct conflict between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>"We will strongly oppose all future assistance packages if they are related to a clear diplomatic strategy aimed at rapidly reducing this war," the authors of the letter said.</p>
<p>They called the "provocation" of the decision to transfer to Ukraine the HIMRS system in June year and spoke negatively about the transfer of Ukraine tanks Abrams.Khus, a group of legislators called the transfer of intelligence information to Ukraine as it complicates attempts to deny the Russian arguments about the "complicity" in Ukraine in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.</p>
<p>Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.</p>
<p>In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.</p>
<p>We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.</p>
<p>Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.</p>
<p>Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.</p>
<p>It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.</p>
<p>The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.</p>
<p>The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.</p>
<p>Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all its senses.</p>
<p>I would like to point out the help in protecting our energy. It was in the capital of Frank that the format conference was held, as it was called, "Energy Ramstein". Paris has accumulated significantly support for Ukraine with equipment for energy, provides social and humanitarian support.</p>
<p>I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.</p>
<p>That is why it is important that as long as aggression continues, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>She had no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Paris Playground - this city will host the 2024th Olympics.</p>
<p>Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.</p>
<p>It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.</p>
<p>I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!</p>
<p>Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for Ukraine!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help!</p>

<p>This opinion is held as they proved the debate in the German Parliament on Thursday evening, 4 with 6 parties of the German Bundestag in addition to the right -wing and left, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“These <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zbroa"></a>Not aimed at continuing, on the contrary, the purpose is to help Ukraine defend against further attacks and to cause war, to establish peace in the region, ”the Social Democrat Hannneswalter said. He noted that for over a year of the war, Ukrainians proved that they could protect their state, and partners, including Germany, from the very beginning they said that Ukraine could rely on them, that they would provide support until it would be necessary. Such support includes the supply of defense -weapons for the Armed Forces, stated the politician.</p>
<p>Representative of the greatest opposition force, CDU/CSU, Thomas Revekamp agreed. "We are not supplying weapons that kills people, but a weapon that saves people of red -Russian murdered attacks," he said.</p>
<p>His one -party party Bernhardt Loos noted that "reality shows: peace of safe, without effective restraint, without effective defense in the event of an attack by a clear utopia." The Russian war, cruel and inhuman, has to stop, therefore, there is a weapon so that Ukrainians can protect themselves from the aggressor, the deputy said.</p>
<p>Jamila Shefer reminded that her party, the Green, has always been a party of peace, "but unfortunately, not every aggressor and not always can be curved by placifist methods. That is why Ukraine deserve our support, ”said the Parliamentary.</p>
<p>Another representative of the same party Mike Ausendorf emphasized that Putin could at least stop the war, and "the termination of supplies of weapons of the Armed Forces would mean that Ukrainian would be able to protect itself, resulting in not peace, but occupation by a free state that has nothing to do From peace.

<p>It is noted that one cargo, under the new agreement, will be delivered to the port of Karachachezhe in May.</p>
<p>The agreement with Pakistan gives Moscow new opportunities to sell its raw oil, adding to the growing sales of Russian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nafta"></a>to India and China, as the Kremlin redirects the volumes from the Western Markets, where its oil was forbidden after the start of a full -scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The reduced price of oil gives the necessary rest for Pakistan, which is collided with the crisis of payments and the problem of critically low currency reserves. Energy imports are currently most of the country's external payments.</p>
<p>The Agreement stipulates that Pakistan will only buy raw oil, not purified, and it is expected that imports will reach 100,000 barrels a day if the first transaction will be without problems, Reuters reported to the Oil Minister of Pakistan Government Musadik Malik.</p>
<p>"Our orders are, we have already placed them," the official said, confirming the information of the agency's source that Pakistan will buy only raw materials, and non -prepared petroleum products.</p>

<p>Зокрема, він вказав на те, що всього через кілька днів після жахливого відео зобезголовленням українського військовополоненого надійшли нові шокуючісвідчення російських військових про злочини, скоєні в Соледарі та Бахмуті, втому числі вбивства дітей і підлітків.</p>

<p>She said this during a panel discussion on the topic: "Women, peace, safety - the defense sector of Ukraine" in the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“If you look at the story, if you read any essays or works about the war, it is usually said that the war has no female face, that war is a fair. And today's situation in Ukraine, which has begun for nine years, even more, so it has radically turned such a stereotype. Because women today are active defenders, serve in all units of the security sector, in the Armed Forces. As of last summer, there were more than 50 thousand women only in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ”Levchenko emphasized.</p>

<p>He expressed this opinion in an interview with Ukrinform.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that the election issue is governed by the Constitution of Ukraine, the election code and a number of other legislative acts. At the same time, the Law on Legal Martial Status states that during the martial law, elections cannot be performed. According <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stefancuk"> </a>, it is possible, because it is impossible to ensure the participation of all citizens in the elections.</p>
<p>“I think the elections will take place immediately after termination of martial law. Otherwise, the law needs to be changed, but again, I doubt that the opportunity will be innovated in Ukraine to hold a qualitative, legitimate election, the results of which will believe in society. So I see this process in view of the analysis of incident. It also seems to me that there are now more important things that need to be concentrated. This is definitely not a question of elections, ”the Verkhovna Rada chairman said.</p>

<p>About it reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-20/us-ukraine-allies-consider-export-ban-for-russia-over-putin-s-war-in-ukraine"></a>Realizing to sources, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>According to the interlocutors of the publication, the officials of the G7 countries discuss this idea before the summit of leaders in Japan, which will take place in May. The main meta is attached to the pressure of the European Union Member States.</p>
<p>Sources emphasize that this approach will turn the sanctions regime - in such a way, all exports will be forbidden, except for the positions that are in the writings. Now all exports are allowed if it does not fall under sanctions.</p>
<p>If G7 leaders support this step at the summit, you will need to reconcile. However, it is likely that medicines and agricultural products, in particular, will not be subject to sanctions.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is noted that there are potentially serious obstacles to the idea of re -realizing the idea. After all, new criteria should be adopted by all member countries. This will cause fierce debate, given the negative reaction by companies that export goods to <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>.</p>
<p>At this time, the cost of exports of EU and EU countries to Russia has almost halved due to sanctions. According to Geneva Trade Data Monitor, products from Europe, the USA, Canada and Japan, which are still in Russia, are estimated at $ 66 billion.</p>
<p>The members of the Seven Group are concerned that it is too much benefit for aggressor economies. In this case, Moscow finds ways to bypass sanctions across the country.</p>
<p>Trade Data Monitor notes that Germany, Italy and Poland remain the largest European exporters of Russian goods. The greatest influence can be given to such categories of goods as cars, chocolate, beer, shoes, flowers and cosmetics, as well as non -medical and non -agricultural goods.</p>
<p>At the same time, European countries continue to buy from Moscow some goods, such as caps, copper, iron and nickel.</p>
<p>The publication notes that an almost complete ban on exports to Russia can even more delineate Moscow with Beijing in finding alternative buyers for sub -goods.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-technology/3697262-kitajski-brendi-zajnali-ponad-70-rosijskogo-rinku-smartfoniv.html"><strong> China </strong></a>As it was reported, the ministers of foreign countries of the Great Seven(G7)Ukomunke stated that their countries will continue to be a single front of Russia's anti -aggressive war in Ukraine, and also emphasized the devotion to the strengthening and application of rigid sanctions against the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent, the Minister of Agrarian Policy of Food of Ukraine Mykola Solsky said on the air of the Teleterna "Unified News".</p>
<p>"If we talk about the quality of Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zerno"></a>, it has long been quite high and has long been a benchmark for other countries. Those who are in the market are well aware of it. Many European countries have been taking Ukrainian grain for the last 5-7 years to mix with their own to raise the quality, "he said.</p>
<p>The minister explained that grain cultivation is a complex technological process that depends on the weather and other factors. In particular, the quality depends on the season.</p>
<p>According to Solsky, this season there are no claims from foreign buyers to the quality of Ukrainian grain. Quality question, he added, was one when Slovakia found remarks not used in Europe in one batch of grain from Ukraine.</p>
<p>However, the head of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy said, the ban on the import of agricultural products of Zvoraina Slovakia introduced not because of claims for grain quality, but on the basis of the rates of trade, which are stipulated by the law of the country.</p>
<p>"Obviously, the motivation for making these decisions is that because of the Ukrainian -seeding in a number that was recently, local farmers cannot sell more expensive. But, from my point of view, it is a debat All prices: both in the Poles, Vrumuns, and Slovaks, have decreased this spring compared to the fact that there were several peasants, " - emphasized Solsky.</p>

<p>This opinion is held as they proved the debate in the German Parliament on Thursday evening, 4 with 6 parties of the German Bundestag in addition to the right -wing and left, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“These <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zbroa"></a>Not aimed at continuing, on the contrary, the purpose is to help Ukraine defend against further attacks and to cause war, to establish peace in the region, ”the Social Democrat Hannneswalter said. He noted that for over a year of the war, Ukrainians proved that they could protect their state, and partners, including Germany, from the very beginning they said that Ukraine could rely on them, that they would provide support until it would be necessary. Such support includes the supply of defense -weapons for the Armed Forces, stated the politician.</p>
<p>Representative of the greatest opposition force, CDU/CSU, Thomas Revekamp agreed. "We are not supplying weapons that kills people, but a weapon that saves people of red -Russian murdered attacks," he said.</p>
<p>His one -party party Bernhardt Loos noted that "reality shows: peace of safe, without effective restraint, without effective defense in the event of an attack by a clear utopia." The Russian war, cruel and inhuman, has to stop, therefore, there is a weapon so that Ukrainians can protect themselves from the aggressor, the deputy said.</p>
<p>Jamila Shefer reminded that her party, the Green, has always been a party of peace, "but unfortunately, not every aggressor and not always can be curved by placifist methods. That is why Ukraine deserve our support, ”said the Parliamentary.</p>
<p>Another representative of the same party Mike Ausendorf emphasized that Putin could at least stop the war, and "the termination of supplies of weapons of the Armed Forces would mean that Ukrainian would be able to protect itself, resulting in not peace, but occupation by a free state that has nothing to do From peace.

In particular, to the Paris Playground - the very city will host the 2024 Olympiad.</p>
<p>He emphasized this in the evening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcfSo0ksxno"></a>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9296"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.</p>
<p>Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.</p>
<p>In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.</p>
<p>We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.</p>
<p>Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.</p>
<p>Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.</p>
<p>It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.</p>
<p>The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.</p>
<p>The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.</p>
<p>Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all its senses.</p>
<p>I would like to point out the help in protecting our energy. It was in the capital of Frank that the format conference was held, as it was called, "Energy Ramstein". Paris has accumulated significantly support for Ukraine with equipment for energy, provides social and humanitarian support.</p>
<p>I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.</p>
<p>That is why it is important that as long as aggression continues, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>She had no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Paris Playground - this city will host the 2024th Olympics.</p>
<p>Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.</p>
<p>It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.</p>

<p>Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.</p>
<p>I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!</p>
<p>Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!</p>

<p>The letter was released on <a href="https://www.lee.senate.gov/services/files/582D6601-A680-45A0-90E4-A92E91B4E2B3"></a>, Senator Mike Lee, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"We are deeply concerned about the fact that the US assistance trajectory with military efforts <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina"></a>It is threatened with further escalation and there is no need for strategic clarity, ”the letter reads.</p>
<p>The text states that the war has been going on for the second year, and still "it is not visible", as well as, they say, there is no clear strategy for its completion.</p>
<p>"Proxy with Russia in Ukraine does not correspond to the strategic interests of the state and risks escalation that can get out of control," the signatories said.</p>
<p>Republicans accused Biden's administration of "a long conflict set" and stated that the current strategy of sanctions against Russia, as well as allocating assistance to Ukraine, would only delay it. They called assistance to "unlimited" and stated that it should be stopped, otherwise, in a word, there is a growing risk of direct conflict between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>"We will strongly oppose all future assistance packages if they are related to a clear diplomatic strategy aimed at rapidly reducing this war," the authors of the letter said.</p>
<p>They called the "provocation" of the decision to transfer to Ukraine the HIMRS system in June year and spoke negatively about the transfer of Ukraine tanks Abrams.Khus, a group of legislators called the transfer of intelligence information to Ukraine as it complicates attempts to deny the Russian arguments about the "complicity" in Ukraine in Ukraine.</p>

<ul>
<li>The enemy does not have those forces today to repeat what was after February 24, but that does not mean that the enemy is broken and not made for Ukraine. They have a large amount of living force, there is a mobilization potential, there is a considerable amount of outdated equipment, which can be dangerous. The most capable part of the Russian army has already been destroyed in Ukraine, - said Andrei Yusov.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Andriy Yusov, security and defense forces are currently preparing and will redeem the Ukrainian territory. The focus of the enemy is observed in the east of Ukraine, including Bakhmut, Slavyansk, Kramatorsk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, their goals were peaceful objects, civilian and energy infrastructure. Today, the tactics are different, because the potential of coming and quality that is already expended, the enemy will not be able, even if you pause until September. However, their propaganda is currently quite effective, - said Andrei Yusov.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Andrei Yusov, the mobilization in Russia continues and will continue. The Volunteers for their part have long been gone, the mobilization there is mostly unsuccessful and the average Russian would not want to be in the temporary and occupied territory of Ukraine. At the same time, they have no resistance and they will humble to fight.</p>

<p>He noted that the United States monitors sanctions, and if it is built that some companies still supply modern double -purpose or tones to the Russian Federation that can be used for production, rigid measures will be implemented in terms of production.</p>

<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>
<p>I am glad to welcome all our country, all of Ukraine are all our beautiful cities, our strong communities, which are presented in the Congress of Local and Regional Power of Ukraine. With this summit, we open a new level of interaction at the Kongres. It is an interaction between our communities, the communities of Ukraine, and the communities of other respectable states - our partners, which we appreciate very high. Those who, like all Ukrainians, appreciate the most important thing - freedom and important, effective self -government.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones!I am very pleased to welcome you, dear representatives and representatives of the European Union, Council of Europe, states, governments and parliamentary partners!Dear mayors of cities, heads of municipalities and associations!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-20T85-00-00-04-00/0b650a99a8fff7b694c216ef2d13118a_1681998160_extra_large.jpeg" />I thank you for your participation in our work format and ask you to fix one important fact - a fact that was confirmed by our defense of the Ed Russian aggression.</p>
<p>The whole Ukrainian people stood up for their state, and it is a manifestation of the experienced people. A people who can act together for the sake of national good, a people who are able to protect their interests, a people whose national safety is to understand that every community should live with dignity ... Such a people have an advantage in the war, namely: it can fight nationally. And I thank each of our people and every Ukrainian community who, in unity with the state and inheritance with each other, help to bring it closer to the most important thing - our jointly!Thank you all, dear ones, who are offline, online!</p>
<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen!</strong></p>
<p>You see that the Russian state is throwing people who do not understand, for the fact that they die on our earth. For them, this land is alien. The invaders carry evil, the Borossian system exists as follows: trying to make the usual mockery of people's depreciation. And trying to take it beyond his borders. It is for this Russia that its weapons - its rockets, bombs, its artillery and shameful terror of the against a normal life.If you consider this war to confront ideas, then with the victory of our states, we will note the victory of the idea that people are important. Everyone and everyone. All of their gromades. Every Ukrainian city, every town, every Ukrainian village. Our state was. And thanks to this approach instead of the ruins that Russia brought to Nesen, we will rebuild true Ukrainian life everywhere - European free life. Such a life that our people are ordinary but free - respect. This is a person respected by everyone.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-20T85-00-00-04-00/02c302ca83ce5473046c15ad33c9efe3_1681998167_extra_large.jpeg" /><strong> Dear, present!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Dear our partners!</strong></p>
<p>I want to turn to you. I invite you all to build direct links with our congress of local and regional authorities and, accordingly, with the help of Congress - with Ukrainian communities to start joint actions as soon as possible, a jointly awakened new system of protection of our lifestyle with you. Open, democratic, the life of free, based on very simple things, too much.</p>
<p>Here and now we see in Ukraine what aggression can bring to any people if you try to repeat it in the other part of the world.</p>
<p>And we see what safety standards are needed today, our sets need. I am sure that in our example we see what safety standards are needed to any country in the world, any towns, villages, communications, transport, energy, all infrastructure(What are we also underwenting this war), schools, education networks, as well as the safety of embankment in general, to guarantee the most important thing-the protection of life ... regions. From bomb shelters in schools to a completely New Standard for all systems of the country, from a new protected infrastructure in each community to a new decentralized power system of Ukraine in general, which cannot be destroyed by rocket terror, which was applied against our state by the Russian Federation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-20T85-00-00-04-00/81aec3f4b7e81981e6594229cd630860_1681998177_extra_large.jpeg" />I am grateful to everyone and everyone who helped us!And especially I would like to be marked today the assistance of Paris, which this winter has become one of the leaders of energy support of Ukraine, who consolidatedly gathered partners in such "Energy Rostein". I thank you very much. This meeting was in Paris, then our partners were supplemented with the appropriate equipment that helped us - absolutely all people, communities - to preserve the light of life.</p>
<p>Ukraine has founded a special distinction for rescuers. You know that many cities in Europe, in Poland, have received this distinction from Ukraine. They were truly aspiring. I am grateful to all our partners. And for me today it will also be a distinction for the great energy support of Mayor Parisapani Ann Idalgo in gratitude for the support of Parisians for Ukraine. Thank you very much, both France, and the President, and thank you to all the priests who support.</p>
<p><strong> Dear present, dear ladies and gentlemen!</strong></p>
<p>Important new Ukrainian protection infrastructure and our cooperation with you for the safety, I am sure, will be an example for countries, cities, communities, for people. Just as Russian aggression has caused global negative, very painful consequences, Ukrainian victory should bring new standard -safety, new experience of joint action and economic potential, new opportunities to build and defend themselves together. Together!At the level of states and companies, communities.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-20T85-00-00-04-00/d22b6f7909ffcf32a65e4b87f2bd2081_1681995766_extra_large.jpeg" />Having carried out a decentralization reform in Ukraine before the war, giving our communities more powers - it is very important - and resources - it is also important - the mate of this congress to provide respect for each community. In order to give each community all the tools for the realization of their interests, the interests of the social community, the interests of communities. Here, in the congress, the central power of our country - both executive power and Izaconaty. We need to work together so that the community does not have to look for offices in the capital. Here is all our local self -government. It was easier for other communities to interact. And faster. Now we add an international component.</p>
<p>I am sure that this component can be fully implemented, to full power - as well as our inner power we use for the full for the protection of Ukraine, our people, for the sake of the victory of Ukraine.<strong>Thank you for your attention!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.</p>
<p>Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.</p>
<p>In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.</p>
<p>We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.</p>
<p>Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.</p>
<p>Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.</p>
<p>It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.</p>
<p>The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.</p>
<p>The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.</p>
<p>I am grateful to anyone who participated in the summit ... representatives of different countries, cities, municipalities. European institutions, the Council of Europe, the President of the EU Committee ... more than one hundred participants from almost forty countries. I am grateful to everyone for the support of Ukraine!</p>
<p>Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.</p>
<p>Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all -persons.I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.</p>
<p>That is why it is important that, while aggression, the Russian state has no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Parisian site - this city will host the 2024 Olympics.</p>
<p>Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.</p>
<p>It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.</p>
<p>I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!</p>
<p>Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for Ukraine!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, about it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcfSo0ksxno"></a> <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/5931"></a>President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky said, informing about the meeting with the mayor of Paris Ms. Ann Idalgo and awarding a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, the honors of the rescuer.</p>

<p>“I thank all the French, all Parisians, French President Macron's attention to Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda. Obviously, a terrorist-state will do everything to justify yourself through sports or to use the International Olympic Movement in support of their aggression. It is the one that, while aggression is ongoing, the Russian state did not have any accessible sports, Olympic sites. In particular, to the Paris Playground - this city will host the 2024 Olympics. Ms. Paris's mayor has confirmed today that she does not see room for representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him, ” - said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zelenskij"></a>.</p>
