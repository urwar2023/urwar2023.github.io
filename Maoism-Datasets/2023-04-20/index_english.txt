It is also the presence of an interdisciplinary team, special equipment, compliance with requirements and standards in the recovery of a person, ”the goose said.
At the same time, a number of hospitals of war veterans are in the territories of active fighting.

In their turn, the Ministry of Veterans informed the desire to take responsibility for providing war veterans with a psychological aid. According to Tatiana Kalita, the Deputy Ministry of Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization, the Ministry has separate funding for psychological assistance. “We ask the MOH to unlock the soullessness to give it.

He emphasized this in the evening President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.
Viso: 
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.
Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.
In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.
We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.
We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.
Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.
Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.
It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.
The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.
The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.
Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all its senses.
I would like to point out the help in protecting our energy. It was in the capital of Frank that the format conference was held, as it was called, "Energy Ramstein". Paris has accumulated significantly support for Ukraine with equipment for energy, provides social and humanitarian support.
I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.
It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.
That is why it is important that as long as aggression continues, She had no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Paris Playground - this city will host the 2024th Olympics.
Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.
It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.
One more.
Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.
I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!
Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!
Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for Ukraine!
Thank you all who help!
Glory to Ukraine!

Such support includes the supply of defense -weapons for the Armed Forces, stated the politician.
Representative of the greatest opposition force, CDU/CSU, Thomas Revekamp agreed. "We are not supplying weapons that kills people, but a weapon that saves people of red -Russian murdered attacks," he said.
His one -party party Bernhardt Loos noted that "reality shows: peace of safe, without effective restraint, without effective defense in the event of an attack by a clear utopia." The Russian war, cruel and inhuman, has to stop, therefore, there is a weapon so that Ukrainians can protect themselves from the aggressor, the deputy said.
Jamila Shefer reminded that her party, the Green, has always been a party of peace, "but unfortunately, not every aggressor and not always can be curved by placifist methods. That is why Ukraine deserve our support, ”said the Parliamentary.
Another representative of the same party Mike Ausendorf emphasized that Putin could at least stop the war, and "the termination of supplies of weapons of the Armed Forces would mean that Ukrainian would be able to protect itself, resulting in not peace, but occupation by a free state that has nothing to do From peace. "

The left, who "do not want to kill Germans," oppose this. "

According to Ukrinform, the agency reports .
It is noted that one cargo, under the new agreement, will be delivered to the port of Karachachezhe in May.
The agreement with Pakistan gives Moscow new opportunities to sell its raw oil, adding to the growing sales of Russian to India and China, as the Kremlin redirects the volumes from the Western Markets, where its oil was forbidden after the start of a full -scale invasion of Ukraine.
The reduced price of oil gives the necessary rest for Pakistan, which is collided with the crisis of payments and the problem of critically low currency reserves. Energy imports are currently most of the country's external payments.
The Agreement stipulates that Pakistan will only buy raw oil, not purified, and it is expected that imports will reach 100,000 barrels a day if the first transaction will be without problems, Reuters reported to the Oil Minister of Pakistan Government Musadik Malik.
"Our orders are, we have already placed them," the official said, confirming the information of the agency's source that Pakistan will buy only raw materials, and non -prepared petroleum products.

Such support includes the supply of defense -weapons for the Armed Forces, stated the politician.
Representative of the greatest opposition force, CDU/CSU, Thomas Revekamp agreed. "We are not supplying weapons that kills people, but a weapon that saves people of red -Russian murdered attacks," he said.
His one -party party Bernhardt Loos noted that "reality shows: peace of safe, without effective restraint, without effective defense in the event of an attack by a clear utopia." The Russian war, cruel and inhuman, has to stop, therefore, there is a weapon so that Ukrainians can protect themselves from the aggressor, the deputy said.

Another representative of the same party Mike Ausendorf emphasized that Putin could at least stop the war, and "the termination of supplies of weapons of the Armed Forces would mean that Ukrainian would be able to protect itself, resulting in not peace, but occupation by a free state that has nothing to do From peace. "

_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.
Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.
In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.
We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.
We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.
Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.
Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.
It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.
The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.
The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.
Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all its senses.
I would like to point out the help in protecting our energy. It was in the capital of Frank that the format conference was held, as it was called, "Energy Ramstein". Paris has accumulated significantly support for Ukraine with equipment for energy, provides social and humanitarian support.
I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.
It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.
That is why it is important that as long as aggression continues, She had no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Paris Playground - this city will host the 2024th Olympics.
Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.
It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.
One more.
Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.
I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!
Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!
Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for Ukraine!
Thank you all who help!
Glory to Ukraine!

Glory to Ukraine! 
I am glad to welcome all our country, all of Ukraine are all our beautiful cities, our strong communities, which are presented in the Congress of Local and Regional Power of Ukraine. With this summit, we open a new level of interaction at the Kongres. It is an interaction between our communities, the communities of Ukraine, and the communities of other respectable states - our partners, which we appreciate very high. Those who, like all Ukrainians, appreciate the most important thing - freedom and important, effective self -government.
Mr. Jones!I am very pleased to welcome you, dear representatives and representatives of the European Union, Council of Europe, states, governments and parliamentary partners!Dear mayors of cities, heads of municipalities and associations!
 I thank you for your participation in our work format and ask you to fix one important fact - a fact that was confirmed by our defense of the Ed Russian aggression.
The whole Ukrainian people stood up for their state, and it is a manifestation of the experienced people. A people who can act together for the sake of national good, a people who are able to protect their interests, a people whose national safety is to understand that every community should live with dignity ... Such a people have an advantage in the war, namely: it can fight nationally. And I thank each of our people and every Ukrainian community who, in unity with the state and inheritance with each other, help to bring it closer to the most important thing - our jointly!Thank you all, dear ones, who are offline, online!
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
You see that the Russian state is throwing people who do not understand, for the fact that they die on our earth. For them, this land is alien. The invaders carry evil, the Borossian system exists as follows: trying to make the usual mockery of people's depreciation. And trying to take it beyond his borders. It is for this Russia that its weapons - its rockets, bombs, its artillery and shameful terror of the against a normal life.If you consider this war to confront ideas, then with the victory of our states, we will note the victory of the idea that people are important. Everyone and everyone. All of their gromades. Every Ukrainian city, every town, every Ukrainian village. Our state was. And thanks to this approach instead of the ruins that Russia brought to Nesen, we will rebuild true Ukrainian life everywhere - European free life. Such a life that our people are ordinary but free - respect. This is a person respected by everyone.
 Dear, present! 
Dear our partners! 
I want to turn to you. I invite you all to build direct links with our congress of local and regional authorities and, accordingly, with the help of Congress - with Ukrainian communities to start joint actions as soon as possible, a jointly awakened new system of protection of our lifestyle with you. Open, democratic, the life of free, based on very simple things, too much.
Here and now we see in Ukraine what aggression can bring to any people if you try to repeat it in the other part of the world.
And we see what safety standards are needed today, our sets need. I am sure that in our example we see what safety standards are needed to any country in the world, any towns, villages, communications, transport, energy, all infrastructure(What are we also underwenting this war), schools, education networks, as well as the safety of embankment in general, to guarantee the most important thing-the protection of life ... regions. From bomb shelters in schools to a completely New Standard for all systems of the country, from a new protected infrastructure in each community to a new decentralized power system of Ukraine in general, which cannot be destroyed by rocket terror, which was applied against our state by the Russian Federation.
 I am grateful to everyone and everyone who helped us!And especially I would like to be marked today the assistance of Paris, which this winter has become one of the leaders of energy support of Ukraine, who consolidatedly gathered partners in such "Energy Rostein". I thank you very much. This meeting was in Paris, then our partners were supplemented with the appropriate equipment that helped us - absolutely all people, communities - to preserve the light of life.
Ukraine has founded a special distinction for rescuers. You know that many cities in Europe, in Poland, have received this distinction from Ukraine. They were truly aspiring. I am grateful to all our partners. And for me today it will also be a distinction for the great energy support of Mayor Parisapani Ann Idalgo in gratitude for the support of Parisians for Ukraine. Thank you very much, both France, and the President, and thank you to all the priests who support.
Dear present, dear ladies and gentlemen! 
Important new Ukrainian protection infrastructure and our cooperation with you for the safety, I am sure, will be an example for countries, cities, communities, for people. Just as Russian aggression has caused global negative, very painful consequences, Ukrainian victory should bring new standard -safety, new experience of joint action and economic potential, new opportunities to build and defend themselves together. Together!At the level of states and companies, communities.
 Having carried out a decentralization reform in Ukraine before the war, giving our communities more powers - it is very important - and resources - it is also important - the mate of this congress to provide respect for each community. In order to give each community all the tools for the realization of their interests, the interests of the social community, the interests of communities. Here, in the congress, the central power of our country - both executive power and Izaconaty. We need to work together so that the community does not have to look for offices in the capital. Here is all our local self -government. It was easier for other communities to interact. And faster. Now we add an international component.
I am sure that this component can be fully implemented, to full power - as well as our inner power we use for the full for the protection of Ukraine, our people, for the sake of the victory of Ukraine. Thank you for your attention! 
Glory to Ukraine!

I wish health, dear Ukrainians! 
He just turned to the Parliament of Mexico, and this is the second such appeal of the pre -region of Latin America. I am grateful to Mexico for his attention to Ukraine and the support of international security, the need for the widest possible unity to protect international law.
Because if the right does not work, life threat will only grow ... The bandits of the Yagresar will become even more arrogant. We should not allow this.
In fact, it was in Kiev that NATO Stoltenberg's NATO Zano Turks were also devoted to Kyiv. Protection of Ukraine. Protection of the entire international order based on the rules. Protection of life.
We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg's position is important. We are preparing for our active action at the front - they are inevitable.
We are also preparing for NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is being processed now. It is at such meetings that in contacts of different levels that we lead with partners.
Neither the majority of Ukrainians nor most Europeans, nor the majority of NATO residents will understand the Alliance's leaders, unless a well -deserved political invitation for Ukraine to the Alliance is sounded at this summit.
Ukraine has done everything in order for our application to be satisfied.
It is difficult even to say whose contribution to European and Euro -Atlantic security is greater than our soldiers ... Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who protect their lives with their lives. I thank all the partners who support us in this.
The international summit of cities and regions took place today in Kyiv. The new formatting of our country with partners.
The Congress of local and regional authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central authority of local leaders, is now gaining international level. In order to actively disappear foreign partners to rebuild in our country, to the development of economic, infrastructure in our communities.
I am grateful to anyone who participated in the summit ... representatives of different countries, cities, municipalities. European institutions, the Council of Europe, the President of the EU Committee ... more than one hundred participants from almost forty countries. I am grateful to everyone for the support of Ukraine!
Today, Ms. Ann Idalgo met with Paris mayor. It was honor to hand over a special distinction of Ukraine for the capital of France, a distinction of the city-rescuer.
Paris has become one of the largest centers for Ukraine in Europe - in all -persons.I thank all the French, all Parisians, President of France Macron for her unchanging for Ukraine, for leadership. And especially I want to mention the absolutely principal and such a consonant Ukrainian position of Ms. Paris on the protection Olympic movement from Russian ideologization, from propaganda.
It is obvious that the terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through the sports to use the International Olympic Movement in support of its aggression.
That is why it is important that, while aggression, the Russian state has no access to the sports, Olympic sites. In particular, the Parisian site - this city will host the 2024 Olympics.
Ms. Paris's mayor has reaffirmed today that she did not see the place for the representatives of the aggressor state in Paris while aggression is ongoing. This is a clear, important signal, thank you for him.
It would be good that such signals may be heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats is dominated by the relevant principles.
One more.
Today, the moon of Ramadan is ends for Muslims ... The bright holiday Ramazan-Bayram deserves the most common conditions. It deserves the peace that we so strive for, we deserve victory, we all go. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with the will for all our territories and all our people.
I wish all our Muslim community and all the Muslims of the peaceful celebration!
Ramazan Bayramıñız Hayırlı ve mubarek olsun!
Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for Ukraine!
Thank you all who help!
Glory to Ukraine!
