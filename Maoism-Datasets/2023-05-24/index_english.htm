Information sites controlled by the aggressor state are replicating messages aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian socialization.</p>

When giving media resources comments or conducting public events, it is worth considering all possible risks and in no way disclose an information that can harm those who are still in Russian captivity.</p>

<p>— Авіаційна коаліція широка, українських пілотів навчатиме низка країн. Наразітриває процес підготовки людей до навчання на F-16. Створено передові групи,які виїхали до тих країн, що надали нам навчальні майданчики. Вивчається, яксаме відбуватиметься дана підготовка, кількість пілотів, часові терміни тощо.У відрядження направлятимуть не лише льотчиків, а й авіаційних інженерів таофіцерів бойових управлінь. Старт навчанню даний — і це головне, — зауваживармієць.</p>
<p>Він уточнив, що всіх військових пілотів одразу ж відправити не можна. Аджекомусь треба забезпечувати дії Сил оборони України. За час війни льотчикиздобули певних професійних висот. Тому поїдуть за кордон підготовленими.</p>
<p>— Кожен курсант Харківського національно університету Повітряних Сил післявипуску у своєму активі вже має по 200 годин нальоту. Далі в бойових бригадахвони вже опановують різні навички пілотування. Наразі ж іде мова про їхнєперенавчання на інший тип літака. Як порівняти з радянським МіГ-29,закордонний F-16 є більш автоматизованим. Але це не означає, що буде легко, —розповів речник Командування Повітряних Сил.</p>
<p>Говорячи про терміни підготовки на F-16, офіцер зауважив, що підготовкукожного льотчика варто розглядати індивідуально, враховуючи ті завдання, щовиконуватиме його авіаційна бригада.</p>

<p>"When I was serving in the army, one of my best comrades was Bashkir.</p>
<p>Thousands of men from Bashkirria were killed or crippled.</p>
<p>The situation impressed me with my absurdity. And she pushed her to write a native to my friend, the whole Bashkir people and his true leaders.</p>
<p>Today's Ufa authorities, taking care of personal gain and working in the interests of Kreml, send its people to death.</p>
<p>Bashkiri is one of the largest peoples of Russia, which is at the same time a uniform situation.</p>
<p>In modern Bashkiria there are three commemorative national groups - Russian, Bashkir and Tatars. The Republic of Bashkortostan has huge natural resources and developed industry. There is everything there to guarantee a high level of pre -production.</p>
<p>The main interest of Bashkir is obvious - to ensure national development in itself in itself, including - through the exercise of the right to self -determination of the truthful distribution of considerable resources in favor of the region.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to concentrate all efforts within Bashkirria and the protection of Moscow.</p>
<p>If you list the problems and threats to the Bashkir people, the cause of them is not Ukraine or Ukrainians. The roots of all reasons - in Moscow and in Ufa.</p>
<p>Instead, Bashkir is sent to die for a thousand kilometers for what.</p>
<p>No one but the Kremlin and its lackeys are interested in it.</p>
<p>This should be stopped as soon as possible.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-23T70-00-00-04-00/20230523-2.jpg" />The emergence of a number of so -called private military companies in the temporarily occupied Crimea is primarily associated with the increase in fear among the Russian occupiers of the hardware of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Chernyak told about it, <a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/strakh-pered-kontrnastupom-zs-ukrainy.html">reports</a>GUR MOU.</p>
<p>"The invaders clearly understand that the fighting in the Crimea will be, and they will build fortifications, defensive lines - not only in the Crimea, but also in the Soviet Farms," - explained Andrey Chernyak.</p>
<p>The representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine added that the leaders of the occupying power to the peninsula will worry because of disappointment by the Russian army: who knows whether it will be waded to protect their families and looted property in Crimea.</p>
<p>“These private armies have been designed to protect occupation administrations because of the realization that Russia's armed forces will be able to protect them. And secondly, they are not sure of the integrity of the Russian Federation. If Russia begins to "fall", then they will have "PVC", which will protect their wealth, families, " - said a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.</p>
<p>According to Andriy Chernyak, the so -called Crimean PECs from various sources are financed: for example, the leader of the occupation administration of Crimea was collected by Aksyonov there and forced money to allocate money for his private army.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, Crimean businessmen are forced to do it, but on the other, they also want to protect themselves and their wealth. The invaders guarantee them that they are evacuated if they are evacuated, and everything will be well, ”Andrey Chernyak said.</p>
<p>The representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the so-called "Aksionovtsi" fighters receive from 200 to 250 thousand rubles a month, train mainly on the bases of preference and temporarily occupied Kherson region, and the instructors for them are professionally trained by Russian military with combat experience: Several times a higher salary - from $ 5,000 or more.</p>
<p>Novens to the Crimean PVC are recruited so as not to compete with his "Wagner": "They are recruited among the mobilized, created double -contraints with PVK and the Ministry of Defense. They are trying to attract the Krym population first, but in addition, they take measures throughout Russia, ” - said the representative of the GUR of Ukraine."In totalitarian Russia, there can be no paramilitary formations that would be subordinate to the power structures," the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence emphasized.</p>

<p>— На Бахмутському напрямку протягом минулої доби було лише три бойовізіткнення. Щоправда, ворог був активний у плані артилерійських ударів — 404рази. Тож про снарядний голод у них не йдеться. У цих боях було знищено 79окупантів, дві самохідні артустановки «Гіацинт» та «Гвоздика», а також 9гармат типу «Мста», Д-20 і Д-30. Окрім цього, знищено 7 БПЛА різних типів, —повідомив офіцер.</p>
<p>Він уточнив, що «вагнерівці» щодня зазнають величезних втрат: до 100 осібвбитими та стільки ж — пораненими. Тому вони давно б відступили, але їхніватажки гонять їх на українські кулі, виставляють за ними «загороджувальнізагони» тощо. Тож усі гучні «заяви» євгена пригожина слід розглядати вконтексті гри на публіку.</p>
<p>— Усі ці місяці ми проводили ефективну оборонну операцію зі сточуванняможливостей ворога, знищували його бойовий потенціал. Не маючи переваги вособовому складі, ми успішно використовували слабкі місця ворога, нестандартнітактичні прийоми. В ході такої активної оборони за найменшої можливості миконтратакували противника. Іноді ми просувалися на 250–1000 метрів, але це бувреальний успіх, а не вигадана пропагандистська брехня, як в окупантів, —зауважив полковник Сергій Череватий.</p>

<p>He emphasized this in the evening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9ipQ0fMj4"></a>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9572"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.</p>
<p>First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.</p>
<p>It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. For only with powerful <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vinisuvac"></a>The air defense system becomes complete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression because of its aggression-it will become even more isolated.</p>
<p>It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.</p>
<p>We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.</p>
<p>The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.</p>
<p>Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.</p>
<p>We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.</p>
<p>Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.</p>
<p>I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.</p>
<p>But today, given that such strokes continue constantly, he wanted to blink directly to the Iran people. To all - to society, Doiran ulma, to every Iranian family, to those people who are able to bring to government decisions in Iran. A simple question: why do you have been the participants of Russian terror? Why are you on the side of the state?</p>
<p>The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.</p>
<p>Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.</p>
<p>When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.</p>
<p>What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.</p>
<p>For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones are what they are and what they give on your behalf.</p>
<p>I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.</p>
<p>Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.</p>
<p>Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.</p>
<p>Glory to all who protect their lives!Let's be strong - we will live!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em> </strong></p>

He emphasized the need to streamline migration, in particular, the digitalization of immigration bodies in federal lands immunicipalities, as well as ensuring the deportation(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina).</p>
<p>"Anyone who is not entitled to stay here must leave Germany," the politician emphasized.</p>

<p>"At this stage, I would like to urge that we do not give up our joint efforts to win Russia in Ukraine, and that they have been a violation of the rules of international order that is taking place in the Neshochi," said Czech President Peter Pavel.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielus Landsbergis at a meeting of foreign ministers was in charge that Ukraine needs more weapons than it receives, and Ukraine's support should be continuous.</p>
<p>The European Commission plans to oblige non-governmental organizations and has established other EU countries to disclose information about any funding obtained from the community.

<p>The cost of goods transported by sea and railway containers from China has fallen from the beginning of the year by 30-35 %.

<p>"Unfortunately, a ban on bathing in the sea in the Black Sea is valid," - said.</p>
<p>Gulyaev stressed that the ban was imposed by the military because there are no waleers on the beaches. Therefore, according to Gulyaev, the city considers the opening of the beaches for bathing, but there is no final decision.</p>
<p>“It can be driven at any time-it is necessary to put nets. There are no walers - it is impossible to put nets, ”Gulyaev explained.</p>
<p>Note that in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-odesa"></a>Such nets are stretched between the traverses on the beach between 13 and 14 large fountain stations. At the entrance there is an information stand with rules of behavior on the coast. The attack is forbidden to be during air anxiety and from 21:00 to 7.00.

<p>This was emphasized by the Head of the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Soviet Saviator Helensky in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>"An important component of this decision(transition <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-pravoslavna-cerkva-ukraini"></a>On the Novoyan calendar from September 1, 2023 -ed.), it is that parishioners who decide to use the old calendar will be able to do so. This circumstance is very important because all transitions to the new Calendar in Orthodox churches were accompanied by a split(For example, in Greece and in a number of countries there are old -calendars). Таким чином, ПЦУ уникнула цього, як іУГКЦ", - сказав він.</p>
<p>На його думку, ухвалене рішення ПЦУ є більш коректним підходом до реалізаціїмісії християнина в світі.</p>
<p>"На мою думку, важливо, щоб календар церкви та календар, за яким ми живемопоза храмовими стінами, були суголосними. Хоча це дискутивна проблема: хтосьвважає, що плин часу у храмі має бути інакшим, аніж у світі, а хтось думає, щочас у церкві та поза нею має бути одним, мовляв, ми не можемо святкувати Новийрік під час посту. Тому рішення ПЦУ, мені здається, є більш адекватнимпідходом до реалізації місії християнина в світі", - зауважив Єленський.</p>
<p>Він також додав, що розмова про перехід на новий церковний календар існуваладавно, але повномасштабне вторгнення стало каталізатором: "релігійні спільнотиУкраїни відокремлюються від усього, пов'язаного з Росією".</p>

<p>He told about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“The situation is difficult. There are federations that have admitted Russians and Belarusians, and regret. For example, the International Judo Federation has done everything on the Olympic Committee. In contrast, it is the Fencing Federation, which was the first to return the Russians, but it works according to the conditions. Now we see as all the first numbers of the Russian national team do not fall into international competitions. The executive committee of the International Federation, in which I enter, works in detail on every sports export: we look at who works in sports clubs "CSKA" or "Dynamo", and we do not allow. Therefore, now the Federation of Fencing Russia wants to refuse a rejection to participate in international competitions. There is a weightlifting Federation that has admitted Russians and Belarusians, but prescribed such criteria that every permit should sign a declaration where he says that against war in Ukraine. We see that Russian athletes do not sign this declaration. I want to dress other federations that do not allow Russians and Belarussians to do in international competitions - these are the Federations of Athletics, Kiorling, Hockey, Basketball, Badminton, Equestrian Sports. Now the situation is difficult, but I am seeing that we are moving properly. It is necessary to work further and do everything for the Russians and Belarusians, ”Gutzait said.</p>
<p>He also thanked the Polish partners who did not allow the Russians and Belarusian to participate in European Games.</p>
<p>“Because the Russians and Belarusians were not allowed to go to European games in Poland, I want to thank our brothers - Poles and the European Olympic Committee, and all of us. This is the work that we do the whole year, ”Gutzait added.</p>

<p>This was where this is during the discussion in the fields of the annual Brussels Forum, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, correspondentation.</p>
<p>“Full security guarantees could be provided in NATO, but it is not something that can happen in the midst of war ... On this issue, Ukraine's membership of Ukraine is different views among the Allies, but the only way to make decisions by VNATO - through consensus is . Consultations are currently underway on how we can respond to the ambition of Ukraine on NATO membership. The Alliances are 31, soon - 32 members, and at this stage I cannot tell what the solution of the Vilnius summit on this issue will be, ”the Secretary General <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jens Stoltenberg again confirmed that all the Alliance countries agree with that. that Ukraine will become a member of NATO in the future. It was very clearly stated by the Madrid Summit last year, and repeated many times from the moment when the Allies first made a Teke decision in 2008 during a summit of Vbuharest.</p>
<p>“We all agree that NATO's doors are open to new members. This is a matter that NATO allies should resolve - when it can join. Moscow has no veto in this matter. At the same time, the most important urgent business now is to ensure that Ukraine wins as a sovereign -dependent country. After all, if Ukraine does not win, then there will not be a question of membership that would be possible to discuss, ”the Alliance head said.</p>
<p>He recalled that the war is by nature unpredictable, so it is contagious to say how it would end and when. But when this war is important, it will be important to ensure that it no longer starts, to stop the trend of aggressive behavior of the Russian Federation and not to allow Putin president to destroy the European Security System.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3713431-reznikov-obgovoriv-z-vollesom-perspektivi-vstupu-ukraini-v-nato.html"><strong> Reznikov </strong></a>It was reported that since the beginning of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine last year, NATO and the Union countries have provided Ukraine with unprecedented political and military assistance, including the supply of modern weapons - machinery, tanks, artillery, air defense and anti -tank.

<p>This was announced today in Brussels during a press conference as a result of the Zprimier Minister of Latvia Krishianis Karinsh, General's Secretary of the Jens Stoltenberg said, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“Over the past days, several allies have announced the start of training for Ukrainian pilots. At some stage, it will also allow us to supply meltis, although when and how it happens, it must still be resolved. I think it would be wise to move forward: to start training, and to depend on the further development of this war and the situation on the ground, to make the steady decisions on the supply of aircraft, ”the Alliance head said.</p>
<p>He noted that this new initiative is another manifestation of the steps of Ukrainian drinking, which the Alliance Allies have taken over for several past months.

Over the past week, the United Kingdom has put modern winged rockets of the Great Radius action to Ukraine, which already bring important changes in the battlefield.</p>
<p>All this, according to Jens Stoltenberg, is a manifestation of long -term obligations. The Allies consider it necessary to provide Ukraine with such militaryity that its armed forces are capable of restraining any further aggression.</p>
<p>“We must ensure that the story does not happen again and deprive Presidentaputin's opportunities to fraud with European security. In this context, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including their air forces, is a very important part of these efforts. Therefore, the 4th generation of NATO aircraft can be part of them. So it will happen, it is difficult to say- after the war, or even during the time, depending on its course- but it will be useful in any case, ”the Secretary General said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>.</p>

<p>This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Solz at the General Assembly of German Association of Cities on Wednesday, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"Everyone who participates, who has joined, deserves our greatest respect and support," Scholt said. Only this year, the Federal Government, according to the head, allocated more than 15 billion euros to federal lands and municipalities on questions related to refugees, which is much more than in 2015, 2016, when the "waves" of refugees were recorded.</p>
<p>However, the chancellor noted, all issues with migration and refugees do not have to be raised. He emphasized the need to streamline migration, in particular, the digitalization of immigration bodies in federal lands immunicipalities, as well as ensuring the deportation(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina).</p>
<p>"Anyone who is not entitled to stay here must leave Germany," the politician emphasized.</p>
<p>At the same time, legal migrants in Germany are welcome, because the country needs working -class.</p>
<p>"We are a developing country and we want more innovations, more renewable energy and more infrastructure," Solz said. To achieve these goals, he noted, immigration of skilled workers is required.</p>
<p>"With the law on qualified immigration, we create one of the most progressive norms in the world and attract talented, motivated and qualified women of icholovik," the Federal Chancellor is convinced.</p>

<p>He emphasized this in the evening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9ipQ0fMj4"></a>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9572"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.</p>
<p>First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.</p>
<p>It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. For only with powerful <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vinisuvac"></a>The air defense system becomes complete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression because of its aggression-it will become even more isolated.</p>
<p>It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.</p>
<p>We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.</p>
<p>The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.</p>
<p>Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.</p>
<p>We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.</p>
<p>Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.</p>
<p>I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.</p>
<p>But today, given that such strokes continue constantly, he wanted to blink directly to the Iran people. To all - to society, Doiran ulma, to every Iranian family, to those people who are able to bring to government decisions in Iran. A simple question: why do you have been the participants of Russian terror? Why are you on the side of the state?</p>
<p>The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.</p>
<p>Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.</p>
<p>When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.</p>
<p>What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.</p>
<p>For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones are what they are and what they give on your behalf.</p>
<p>I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.</p>
<p>Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.</p>
<p>Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.</p>
<p>Glory to all who protect their lives!Let's be strong - we will live!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em> </strong></p>

<p>The NATO Secretary General reminded that the Alliance has supported the Partnership with Georgia for many years, helps in implementing reforms and implements political and practical cooperation. In this case, Georgia is the most vulnerable among countries that are "intervals" of the harmful influence of Russia by the Tesecratic world. It was in Georgia that in 2008 the tendency of Russian aggressive behavior against neighbors was manifested when Russia invaded this country and seized some of its territories.</p>

<p>** From the temporarily occupied Crimean peninsula, Russian invaders export valuable museum exhibits to the Russian Federation. In particular, the propaganda media of the invaders spread information about the export from the National Reserve "Chersonese Tavriysky", located in Sevastopol, artifactivantian period, which were brought to the Gold of Byzantium Golden.</p>
<p><strong> The archeologian, an employee of the Institutearchyology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and an expert of the Crimean Platform Network Evelyn Kravchenko, told about what is happening in the museums of Crimea and in other temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Since the occupation of the Crimean Peninsulas Federation, it is closely monitored by the cultural heritage of the monuments in Crimea. </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-24T53-00-00-04-00/k2udr80a57kk08w84o.jpg" /><strong> - Mrs. Evelyno, who and under what pretext exports exhibits from Ukrainian museums from Crimea to Russia? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is known about the group of employees of the Museum of the Novgorod Kremlin, who go to the proposition to be brought to themselves, to the Novgorod Kremlin, artifacts not only of the Skrym, but also from other temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Actually, there are information from everywhere that there were some people from Novgorod with a proposal to give exhibit for the exhibition in their Kremlin.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, they suggested that collections from the temporarily occupied Kamyanka-Dniprovskaya in Zaporizhzhia region. It is unknown at this time what they planned to take out, but the Russians were chast and sought there.</p>
<p>Then they visited the occupied part of the Kherson region, where they also sought out that it could be taken to Russia everywhere, but almost everything was completely looted there, nothing left. And now this group reached the Crimea again and proposed to remove unique exhibits from Chersonese.</p>
<p>It's an export, it's not an exhibition. Everyone is well aware that the exhibition project is to be anxious for exporting things to Russia with the sight to leave them there forever.</p>

<p><strong> - you said - on one side… </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>About a month ago, a letter was received from Moscow to Sevastopol with a secret "secret", which states that in the case of defense of the city it does not contain hazards to preserve cultural heritage objects, that is, museum bands. Therefore, museums should urgently prepare evacuation, indicate the necessary amount of rail, automobile, aviation, marine transport, which museum exhibits plan to export to Russia.</li>

<p>The headquarters noted that if a person is accounted for in the National Information Bureau, it is involved in exchanges.</p>
<p>“All information from relatives is accounted for. Even if you send us photographers in Balaklava and say that this is your native, we will fix it: loved ones weigh that they are their defender. We also account for information from other structures, ”the staff emphasized.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was reported that a certain number of confirmations of captivity of defenders from the 113rd brigade from the Russian side were received through the ICRC.</p>

During nine occupation in the Donbass and the Crimean Peninsula, Ukrainian identity is destroyed. The creation of an information and educational ghetto occurs - in the occupied territories of Kherson, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhya regions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies in the liberated territories show that it is young people and children, the most vulnerable part of Ukrainian society, have become an instrument of the aggressor of voming actions. Therefore, after the military de -occupation of Crimea, we need to conduct a systemic de -occupation of the Crimean consciousness, and above all children, - said the head of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security Igor Solovey at the beginning of the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the educational space of the occupied Crimea is also undergoing an aggressor. The object of encroachment of Russian propagandists of the Russian Federation was even the least at the age of 5 years, that is, preschoolers.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to official data of the Russian Federation, only 34 children in the whole Crimea have access to the Ukrainian language in the Ukrainian language. Also, the influence of propagandists is spreading at the age of 16-17 years, which are directed to the militarization of the larger recruitment to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, - said Valentin Potapov, the head of the Central Civic Enlightenment of Almena.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-24T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-24-at-12.51.11-2.jpeg" />According to the Almena Center, 230 thousand children in the Crimea and 53.5 thousand in Sevastopol went to the school in the 2022/2023 academic year. Among them are about 2 thousand children from the occupied territories of Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya region. 50,000 children are enrolled in Crimean universities. The educational process of the semi -island is provided by about 30 thousand pedagogical staff, and this is digital to understand the processes of future reintegration.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-24T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-24-at-12.51.11.jpeg" />- For all these children, a whole system of destruction of Ukrainian identity has been created, which intends to turn these children into Russians. Almost all the concepts, which have been introduced since 2014 and intensified since 2022 by the adoption of the law, propatriotic education in the Crimea, aimed at preschoolers, students, students and pupils of boarding schools, - said the expert.- Today there is only one school, near the city of Feodosia, where they currently study up to 9th grade 182 children and another 15 children study in their mother tongue. That is, in total in occupied Crimea, only 197 children are learning a generic language(of 230 thousand), - Valentina Potapova emphasized.</p>
<p>According to the expert, for nine years in the Crimea it is completely prohibited the history of Ukraine: neither in the educational process nor in libraries, nor in Ukrainian cultural centers of access to the history of Ukraine. In the textbook of world history, which is introduced by Russia, Ukraine does not exist, the textbooks on the history of Russia Ukraine have no subjectivity, but presented as part of the Russian Empire. Therefore, children on the peninsula do not understand that the state as Ukraine is such a people as Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Among the tools of propaganda of the racists - special "ideological lessons" - "Exploring about the important", "lessons of courage", which are conducted every Monday are urgent for distortion of history, splashing facts, justification of war. handling weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are now 128 cadet classes in Crimea, where about three thousand children are being prepared. As of today, there are more than 874 unarmies in Crimea, the number of children involved in this organization reaches 30 thousand. Military movements, including "eagles" and "movement of the first" spread to other occupied territories, including22 such movements are now opened in Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, - said Lydroe Expert. This trend leads to tragic consequences for Ukrainian children in the occupied territories-their faces can be seen in the memorial plants of the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war on the side of the Russian Federation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, there is a demographic engineering by the occupier country. Ukrainian citizens with an active position are Crimean, but instead encourages the crossing of Russian citizens from the Russian Federation, in particular through the introduction of special programs "Zemsky Teacher" and "Zemsky Doctor". Discriminatory for ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars is forced to conceal the national identity.</p>
<p>For nine years of occupation, Ukraine has lost a whole generation of Crimean children, but today a strategic vision of demilitarization of the system of education and the return of the Ukrainian components to educational processes is needed in order to return the Ukrainian consciousness to children and young Crimea.</p>

<p>During the ITU Regional Development Forum for Europe - a regional development forum for Europe organized by the International Telecommunication Union(ICE), one of the panels was devoted to consideration of the issue of implementation of the IE1408 council resolution regarding the support of Ukraine in the restoration of telecom infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Head of the State Secretariat, Yuri Shchigol, in an appeal to the participants of the Forum, reminded that Russia continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine, destroying and destroying civilian infrastructure before. In particular, telecommunications, infrastructure and radio. The invaders not only destroyed the equipment into billionatolarists, but also intercepting communication channels, frequencies of broadcasting, etc.</p>
<p>“We are grateful for the support provided by Ukraine. The restoration of infrastructure of Ukraine contributes to the socio-economic development of each of the Member States to denounce the goals of sustainable development. At the same time, we urge partner to accentuate and strengthen support of Ukraine, in particular - through a special fund, created for the implementation of the resolution 1408. This is an important practical tool for restoring the electric telecommunication industry of Ukraine, ”Yuri Shchigol said.</p>
<p>During the event, representatives of Sweden, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Slovenia spoke with the words of support of Ukraine, and also spoke about the assistance provided by the state. Among other things, it is the provision of equipment, humanitarian assistance, facilitating the broadcasting of the Ukrainian radio signal for the fight against Russian propaganda, launching and supporting projects and initiatives aimed at creating a stable digital environment and more.</p>

Before proceeding to the tasks, four -legged assistants pass a cinema school at the center of mine activity, and then start work.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the engineering-sapper battalion Andriy Bogatirenko tells that the personalities help where it is not always possible for a person to find an explosive survey, in particular in hard-to-reach places and under rubble. When the dog is suspicious, it gives a sign: either lies down or sits. Each cynologist knows in detail the habits of his ward. The place of finding is denoted, the adal is on the right.</p>
<p>The working day in Sirius and the Besi is shortened, because the dog is not a robot and it is necessary to take a break from loads. In the hot season, breaks for recreation are larger. The miners use its smell when searching - and this is a large load on its nervous system. Rest, and then again work.</p>
<p>To protect dogs, as well as people are worn by bulletproof vests and protective oceans to avoid injury. And after a busy day, says Andriybogatirenko, their wards take water treatments as a kind of relax. Thanks to the painstaking work of cinema calculations, the area of purified Ukrainian land is gradually increasing.</p>

<p>Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.</p>
<p>First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.</p>
<p>It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. Because with powerful aircraft, the air defense system becomes full.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that, due to its aggression, Russia will only lose it-it will become even more isolated.</p>
<p>It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.</p>
<p>We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.</p>
<p>The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.</p>
<p>Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.</p>
<p>We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.</p>
<p>Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.</p>
<p>I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.</p>
<p>If we take, for example, only one tool of Russian terror - Iranian "Shahda", today in the account of our soldiers almost 900 of these whipped drones. In general, about 1160 "Shahmed" was used against Ukraine. Most - we get.</p>
<p>And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.</p>
<p>Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.</p>
<p>When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.</p>
<p>What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.</p>
<p>For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones - what they are, and what they give on your behalf.</p>
<p>I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.</p>
<p>Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, the confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.</p>
<p>Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.</p>
<p>Glory to all who protect their lives!</p>
<p>Thank you all in the world who helps to strengthen our air defense, our aviation and the rescue people from Russian terror!</p>
<p>Let's be strong - we will live!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>The enormous path of vaccination against Russian info. We learned to cut and feel even between the lines of their insidiousness.</p>
<p>It seemed that this rule already subconsciously works for everyone - we believe in official sources.</p>
<p>We do not believe the impersonal sources of information - when there is neither a name nor a name of the Institution, nor other identifying features. When you just don't know who was the census.</p>
<p>But the larger the beacon, the more they believe.</p>
<p>The Russians write in telegrams that have happened to our Glavcom.</p>
<p>And what? Well, let them write.</p>
<p>We have denied it - repeatedly. He does his job. And it does not bypass fakes, as well as other commander of which enemies write inventions.</p>
<p>We do not substitute doubles.</p>
<p>The Russians just test their IPSO.</p>

We made our research in order to understand how to develop information and Russian society. And we, our experts, reach that the only thing they are afraid of there is real to die in Ukraine, it is not possible to hide it.</p>
<p>Their authorities hid in every possible way that they were dying here and even in such a quantity, but now it is no longer possible to hide. And indeed, the Bakhmut campaign for them is the most expensive not only in the sense of how much they have been armaments of Ivian technology, and it was destroyed by our troops, but it is the most expensive of them - in the sense of human losses.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine as much as they put people there that the state could not protect their people so much. - said in the Ether of the Telelorphone "(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)»Deputy Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>

<ul>
<li>I will remind that our troops began to move forward. Before that, we were in fact in positions that did not allow enemy forces into the depths of the city and its lobbies. Several special military tasks were performed there. The main task was to destroy the enemy, and it was done very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bakhmat itself, our troops have active assault actions, but in the Podomstizarase - it is really the first advancement, and in the last few days it is a specialized square kilometers that we have returned and do not lose, gradually overpowered.</p>
<p>In the very place, the enemy concentrated a huge number of troops, people of and arms-now they again brought there landing and assault detachments, so tamcitation is complicated. But they came here like a mousetrap.</p>
<p>When they lose, they simply destroy all objects, equating them in a Itly way in the land - actually squeeze our armed forces with a stand -alone artillery fire. They did so in Syria. They are their style.</p>
<p>It must be granted that every meter, where our defenders and defenders are in Bakhmut, they are worth ten kilometers of complexity of combat missions. And ours there is moving contrary to the fact that more power is more and in the number of troops and arms.</p>
<p>It speaks of two things - the courage, the indomitability of our warriors, and we all have a grammatically planned command of the Bakhmut direction - Hannamaars noted.</p>
