“The warriors of the three elements - the earth, water and heaven today celebrate their day. A day of night horror in the berets of the color of the storm wave, ”Oleksireznikov wrote.
He recalled that during the years of ATO/OOS, Ukrainian Marines argued every time: where they have a position they are - there will be non -conversations.
“The start of the large -scale war was met at the forefront, where the titanic courage was shown and the enemy was difficult to describe the enemy. And today they are in the release of Ukrainian land from invaders. The enemy should be thoughtful: even at such a difficult time, we form new units of infantry, which will inevitably bring them closer to the Cobzon concert.
It is proud that I have friends among Ukrainian marines, proud that samples of wedge weapons come to them, proud to be Ukrainian near them.
Happy Holidays, Break!Semper fi!” - said Alexei Reznikov.

— Авіаційна коаліція широка, українських пілотів навчатиме низка країн. Наразітриває процес підготовки людей до навчання на F-16. Створено передові групи,які виїхали до тих країн, що надали нам навчальні майданчики. Вивчається, яксаме відбуватиметься дана підготовка, кількість пілотів, часові терміни тощо.У відрядження направлятимуть не лише льотчиків, а й авіаційних інженерів таофіцерів бойових управлінь. Старт навчанню даний — і це головне, — зауваживармієць.
Він уточнив, що всіх військових пілотів одразу ж відправити не можна. Аджекомусь треба забезпечувати дії Сил оборони України. За час війни льотчикиздобули певних професійних висот. Тому поїдуть за кордон підготовленими.
— Кожен курсант Харківського національно університету Повітряних Сил післявипуску у своєму активі вже має по 200 годин нальоту. Далі в бойових бригадахвони вже опановують різні навички пілотування. Наразі ж іде мова про їхнєперенавчання на інший тип літака. Як порівняти з радянським МіГ-29,закордонний F-16 є більш автоматизованим. Але це не означає, що буде легко, —розповів речник Командування Повітряних Сил.
Говорячи про терміни підготовки на F-16, офіцер зауважив, що підготовкукожного льотчика варто розглядати індивідуально, враховуючи ті завдання, щовиконуватиме його авіаційна бригада.

Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov wrote Appeal to the Bashkir people and their true leaders. Next is a quote:
"When I was serving in the army, one of my best comrades was Bashkir.
Thousands of men from Bashkirria were killed or crippled.
The situation impressed me with my absurdity. And she pushed her to write a native to my friend, the whole Bashkir people and his true leaders.
Today's Ufa authorities, taking care of personal gain and working in the interests of Kreml, send its people to death.
Bashkiri is one of the largest peoples of Russia, which is at the same time a uniform situation.
In modern Bashkiria there are three commemorative national groups - Russian, Bashkir and Tatars. The Republic of Bashkortostan has huge natural resources and developed industry. There is everything there to guarantee a high level of pre -production.
The main interest of Bashkir is obvious - to ensure national development in itself in itself, including - through the exercise of the right to self -determination of the truthful distribution of considerable resources in favor of the region.
To do this, you need to concentrate all efforts within Bashkirria and the protection of Moscow.
If you list the problems and threats to the Bashkir people, the cause of them is not Ukraine or Ukrainians. The roots of all reasons - in Moscow and in Ufa.
Instead, Bashkir is sent to die for a thousand kilometers for what.
No one but the Kremlin and its lackeys are interested in it.
This should be stopped as soon as possible.

 The emergence of a number of so -called private military companies in the temporarily occupied Crimea is primarily associated with the increase in fear among the Russian occupiers of the hardware of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Chernyak told about it, reports GUR MOU.
"The invaders clearly understand that the fighting in the Crimea will be, and they will build fortifications, defensive lines - not only in the Crimea, but also in the Soviet Farms," - explained Andrey Chernyak.
The representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine added that the leaders of the occupying power to the peninsula will worry because of disappointment by the Russian army: who knows whether it will be waded to protect their families and looted property in Crimea.
“These private armies have been designed to protect occupation administrations because of the realization that Russia's armed forces will be able to protect them. And secondly, they are not sure of the integrity of the Russian Federation. If Russia begins to "fall", then they will have "PVC", which will protect their wealth, families, " - said a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.
According to Andriy Chernyak, the so -called Crimean PECs from various sources are financed: for example, the leader of the occupation administration of Crimea was collected by Aksyonov there and forced money to allocate money for his private army.
“On the one hand, Crimean businessmen are forced to do it, but on the other, they also want to protect themselves and their wealth. The invaders guarantee them that they are evacuated if they are evacuated, and everything will be well, ”Andrey Chernyak said.
The representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the so-called "Aksionovtsi" fighters receive from 200 to 250 thousand rubles a month, train mainly on the bases of preference and temporarily occupied Kherson region, and the instructors for them are professionally trained by Russian military with combat experience: Several times a higher salary - from $ 5,000 or more.
Novens to the Crimean PVC are recruited so as not to compete with his "Wagner": "They are recruited among the mobilized, created double -contraints with PVK and the Ministry of Defense. They are trying to attract the Krym population first, but in addition, they take measures throughout Russia, ” - said the representative of the GUR of Ukraine."In totalitarian Russia, there can be no paramilitary formations that would be subordinate to the power structures," the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence emphasized.

 The spokesman of the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces Colonel Sergeycheriev on the broadcast of the TEMACHONPON told this "Unin" .
— На Бахмутському напрямку протягом минулої доби було лише три бойовізіткнення. Щоправда, ворог був активний у плані артилерійських ударів — 404рази. Тож про снарядний голод у них не йдеться. У цих боях було знищено 79окупантів, дві самохідні артустановки «Гіацинт» та «Гвоздика», а також 9гармат типу «Мста», Д-20 і Д-30. Окрім цього, знищено 7 БПЛА різних типів, —повідомив офіцер.
Він уточнив, що «вагнерівці» щодня зазнають величезних втрат: до 100 осібвбитими та стільки ж — пораненими. Тому вони давно б відступили, але їхніватажки гонять їх на українські кулі, виставляють за ними «загороджувальнізагони» тощо. Тож усі гучні «заяви» євгена пригожина слід розглядати вконтексті гри на публіку.
— Усі ці місяці ми проводили ефективну оборонну операцію зі сточуванняможливостей ворога, знищували його бойовий потенціал. Не маючи переваги вособовому складі, ми успішно використовували слабкі місця ворога, нестандартнітактичні прийоми. В ході такої активної оборони за найменшої можливості миконтратакували противника. Іноді ми просувалися на 250–1000 метрів, але це бувреальний успіх, а не вигадана пропагандистська брехня, як в окупантів, —зауважив полковник Сергій Череватий.

Is stated. That this procedure is a component of the state policy of the Russian Federation, directed by the genocide of Ukrainians. Thus, the Government of the Russian Federation has allocated more than 1.4 million rubles for "preventive medical examinations" in 2023. The process is managed by Putin for the rights of children Maria Lviv-Belov. On March 17, 2023, the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued a warrant for the arrest of Lviv-Belova and Putin for illegal deportation of Ukrainian children.

 The first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression-it will be weaker, it will become even more isolated.
He emphasized this in the evening President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.
Viso: 
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.
First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.
We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.
It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. For only with powerful The air defense system becomes complete.
On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression because of its aggression-it will become even more isolated.
It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.
We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.
Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.
The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.
Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.
We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.
Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.
I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.
But today, given that such strokes continue constantly, he wanted to blink directly to the Iran people. To all - to society, Doiran ulma, to every Iranian family, to those people who are able to bring to government decisions in Iran. A simple question: why do you have been the participants of Russian terror? Why are you on the side of the state?
The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.
Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.
When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.
What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?
Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.
For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones are what they are and what they give on your behalf.
I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.
Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.
Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.
Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.
Glory to all who protect their lives!Let's be strong - we will live!
Glory to Ukraine!

 The transitional period during the introduction of the newlyan calendar will protect the Orthodox church of Ukraine from internal split.
This was emphasized by the Head of the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Soviet Saviator Helensky in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.
"An important component of this decision(transition On the Novoyan calendar from September 1, 2023 -ed.), it is that parishioners who decide to use the old calendar will be able to do so. This circumstance is very important because all transitions to the new Calendar in Orthodox churches were accompanied by a split(For example, in Greece and in a number of countries there are old -calendars). Таким чином, ПЦУ уникнула цього, як іУГКЦ", - сказав він.
На його думку, ухвалене рішення ПЦУ є більш коректним підходом до реалізаціїмісії християнина в світі.
"На мою думку, важливо, щоб календар церкви та календар, за яким ми живемопоза храмовими стінами, були суголосними. Хоча це дискутивна проблема: хтосьвважає, що плин часу у храмі має бути інакшим, аніж у світі, а хтось думає, щочас у церкві та поза нею має бути одним, мовляв, ми не можемо святкувати Новийрік під час посту. Тому рішення ПЦУ, мені здається, є більш адекватнимпідходом до реалізації місії християнина в світі", - зауважив Єленський.
Він також додав, що розмова про перехід на новий церковний календар існуваладавно, але повномасштабне вторгнення стало каталізатором: "релігійні спільнотиУкраїни відокремлюються від усього, пов'язаного з Росією".

 The Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine and the President of the National Olympic Committee Gutzait assessed the situation with the admission of Russian and Belarussian athletes to international competitions.
He told about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.
“The situation is difficult. There are federations that have admitted Russians and Belarusians, and regret. For example, the International Judo Federation has done everything on the Olympic Committee. In contrast, it is the Fencing Federation, which was the first to return the Russians, but it works according to the conditions. Now we see as all the first numbers of the Russian national team do not fall into international competitions. The executive committee of the International Federation, in which I enter, works in detail on every sports export: we look at who works in sports clubs "CSKA" or "Dynamo", and we do not allow. Therefore, now the Federation of Fencing Russia wants to refuse a rejection to participate in international competitions. There is a weightlifting Federation that has admitted Russians and Belarusians, but prescribed such criteria that every permit should sign a declaration where he says that against war in Ukraine. We see that Russian athletes do not sign this declaration. I want to dress other federations that do not allow Russians and Belarussians to do in international competitions - these are the Federations of Athletics, Kiorling, Hockey, Basketball, Badminton, Equestrian Sports. Now the situation is difficult, but I am seeing that we are moving properly. It is necessary to work further and do everything for the Russians and Belarusians, ”Gutzait said.
He also thanked the Polish partners who did not allow the Russians and Belarusian to participate in European Games.
“Because the Russians and Belarusians were not allowed to go to European games in Poland, I want to thank our brothers - Poles and the European Olympic Committee, and all of us. This is the work that we do the whole year, ”Gutzait added.

 The first Zam-Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression-it will be weaker, it will become even more isolated.
He emphasized this in the evening President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.
Viso: 
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.
First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.
We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.
It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. For only with powerful The air defense system becomes complete.
On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose its aggression because of its aggression-it will become even more isolated.
It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.
We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.
Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.
The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.
Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.
We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.
Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.
I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.
But today, given that such strokes continue constantly, he wanted to blink directly to the Iran people. To all - to society, Doiran ulma, to every Iranian family, to those people who are able to bring to government decisions in Iran. A simple question: why do you have been the participants of Russian terror? Why are you on the side of the state?
The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.
Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.
When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.
What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?
Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.
For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones are what they are and what they give on your behalf.
I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.
Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.
Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.
Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.
Glory to all who protect their lives!Let's be strong - we will live!
Glory to Ukraine!

 This was reported during roundstone "Deoccupation and Reintegration of Crym: Challenges in the Field of Education", which took place in Ukrinform. During nine occupation in the Donbass and the Crimean Peninsula, Ukrainian identity is destroyed. The creation of an information and educational ghetto occurs - in the occupied territories of Kherson, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhya regions.
Currently, the educational space of the occupied Crimea is also undergoing an aggressor. The object of encroachment of Russian propagandists of the Russian Federation was even the least at the age of 5 years, that is, preschoolers.
 According to the Almena Center, 230 thousand children in the Crimea and 53.5 thousand in Sevastopol went to the school in the 2022/2023 academic year. Among them are about 2 thousand children from the occupied territories of Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya region. 50,000 children are enrolled in Crimean universities. The educational process of the semi -island is provided by about 30 thousand pedagogical staff, and this is digital to understand the processes of future reintegration.
 - For all these children, a whole system of destruction of Ukrainian identity has been created, which intends to turn these children into Russians. Almost all the concepts, which have been introduced since 2014 and intensified since 2022 by the adoption of the law, propatriotic education in the Crimea, aimed at preschoolers, students, students and pupils of boarding schools, - said the expert.- Today there is only one school, near the city of Feodosia, where they currently study up to 9th grade 182 children and another 15 children study in their mother tongue. That is, in total in occupied Crimea, only 197 children are learning a generic language(of 230 thousand), - Valentina Potapova emphasized.
According to the expert, for nine years in the Crimea it is completely prohibited the history of Ukraine: neither in the educational process nor in libraries, nor in Ukrainian cultural centers of access to the history of Ukraine. In the textbook of world history, which is introduced by Russia, Ukraine does not exist, the textbooks on the history of Russia Ukraine have no subjectivity, but presented as part of the Russian Empire. Therefore, children on the peninsula do not understand that the state as Ukraine is such a people as Ukrainians.
Among the tools of propaganda of the racists - special "ideological lessons" - "Exploring about the important", "lessons of courage", which are conducted every Monday are urgent for distortion of history, splashing facts, justification of war. handling weapons.
At the same time, there is a demographic engineering by the occupier country. Ukrainian citizens with an active position are Crimean, but instead encourages the crossing of Russian citizens from the Russian Federation, in particular through the introduction of special programs "Zemsky Teacher" and "Zemsky Doctor". Discriminatory for ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars is forced to conceal the national identity.
For nine years of occupation, Ukraine has lost a whole generation of Crimean children, but today a strategic vision of demilitarization of the system of education and the return of the Ukrainian components to educational processes is needed in order to return the Ukrainian consciousness to children and young Crimea.

 Petro Chernyk, a military expert, spoke about this in the live broadcast of the only news.
-The operation of "Freedom of Russia" and the Russian Volunteer Corps has a dualMeta: military and information-psychological. There are several serious strategic conclusions. First and most importantly, it is a very serious blow to Putin's Poimigzja as a guarantor of territorial integrity and inviolability of Cordonovrf. Secondly, the taboo is removed, which can be carried out fighting in territories and it is incredibly good. It turned out that their border is absolutely hole. The third conclusion is that all Russian elites think whether they can feel safe if such raids are already happening, - it is noted.
He also added that such steps can not be broken by the course of war, at least the guerrilla movement should be at times larger. And there are such signs of Nabilhorod region.

During the ITU Regional Development Forum for Europe - a regional development forum for Europe organized by the International Telecommunication Union(ICE), one of the panels was devoted to consideration of the issue of implementation of the IE1408 council resolution regarding the support of Ukraine in the restoration of telecom infrastructure.
The Head of the State Secretariat, Yuri Shchigol, in an appeal to the participants of the Forum, reminded that Russia continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine, destroying and destroying civilian infrastructure before. In particular, telecommunications, infrastructure and radio. The invaders not only destroyed the equipment into billionatolarists, but also intercepting communication channels, frequencies of broadcasting, etc.
“We are grateful for the support provided by Ukraine. The restoration of infrastructure of Ukraine contributes to the socio-economic development of each of the Member States to denounce the goals of sustainable development. At the same time, we urge partner to accentuate and strengthen support of Ukraine, in particular - through a special fund, created for the implementation of the resolution 1408. This is an important practical tool for restoring the electric telecommunication industry of Ukraine, ”Yuri Shchigol said.
During the event, representatives of Sweden, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Slovenia spoke with the words of support of Ukraine, and also spoke about the assistance provided by the state. Among other things, it is the provision of equipment, humanitarian assistance, facilitating the broadcasting of the Ukrainian radio signal for the fight against Russian propaganda, launching and supporting projects and initiatives aimed at creating a stable digital environment and more.

 The three -year -old Belgian shepherd of Malina named Sirius and a two -year -old German blackberg named Besi - not new to the sapper business. Before proceeding to the tasks, four -legged assistants pass a cinema school at the center of mine activity, and then start work.
About it reports DSST.
The headquarters of the engineering-sapper battalion Andriy Bogatirenko tells that the personalities help where it is not always possible for a person to find an explosive survey, in particular in hard-to-reach places and under rubble. When the dog is suspicious, it gives a sign: either lies down or sits. Each cynologist knows in detail the habits of his ward. The place of finding is denoted, the adal is on the right.
The working day in Sirius and the Besi is shortened, because the dog is not a robot and it is necessary to take a break from loads. In the hot season, breaks for recreation are larger. The miners use its smell when searching - and this is a large load on its nervous system. Rest, and then again work.
To protect dogs, as well as people are worn by bulletproof vests and protective oceans to avoid injury. And after a busy day, says Andriybogatirenko, their wards take water treatments as a kind of relax. Thanks to the painstaking work of cinema calculations, the area of purified Ukrainian land is gradually increasing.

 I wish health, dear Ukrainians! 
Today, the first meeting meeting after all important visits, a meeting of decisions - defensive decisions, which we worked for a long time and we have them in cooperation with partners.
First of all, it concerns the aviation coalition - coalitions of modern fighters for Ukraine.
We do our best to reduce the time to the result, before the appearance of Ukrainian pilots in the Ukrainian non -Ukrainian and powerful planes.
It is clear that this global step will enhance our defensiveness. Because with powerful aircraft, the air defense system becomes full.
On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will become one of the strongest signals from the world that, due to its aggression, Russia will only lose it-it will become even more isolated.
It will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on the substitute for independent nations and to the right of peoples to choose their own way, has stood.
We will prepare all the necessary base so that such aircraft transition happens measuresly quickly and efficiently.
Our warriors have already proven that they can capture modern weapons as effective as they did not even expect us. With planes, I'm sure it will be as successful.
The main thing is the speed of training and supply, that is, the time that will pass by the interruptions and the real protection of our sky.
Today, as always, he heard the reports of the commander, the head of the GUR, the head of the GUR about the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier and the quietness that Russia is about to use against us.
We know what to answer. In particular, this applies to the rocket threat and the constant terror Droam-Kamikadze.
Now Russia is increasingly resorting to the so -called combined blows - different types of rockets, different types of drones.
I thank our air forces, all our defenders of the sky, our intelligence - but that our protection is being improved faster than Russia has time to change its tactics of terror.
If we take, for example, only one tool of Russian terror - Iranian "Shahda", today in the account of our soldiers almost 900 of these whipped drones. In general, about 1160 "Shahmed" was used against Ukraine. Most - we get.
And we are constantly looking for tools to make the amount of Iranian drone.The world sees what is happening and you see all in Iran. Support is denying the support.
Although we have learned to knock down most of your Kamikadze drones, which you are transmitting, but there is still a hit.
When the Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl with her husband at home, why is it for you, mothers and parents in Iran? When your "shahad" is a hostel with our students, people die, a fire begins, rescuers are harvested on the location, and in a few minutes the second "Shahped" beats, taking away the life of those who saved the lives Hands of Russia, but yours, your weapon.
What do you get from this, people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or Saccoon, or any other city of your country?
Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world, even greater problems.
For Russia, target is absolutely everything. Housing, schools, hospitals, prayer houses, churches, power plants, markets, even the issuance of humanitarian aid tape stops ... There are already thousands of such examples. Iran people!Russia beats everything without disassembling. Artillery and mortars, rockets and drones - what they are, and what they give on your behalf.
I am sure you have to be on the other side of history - not with evil.
Russia began this war for enslavement. It is the war of the colonizer of the dissequent nation. Russia even steals people - our children!Thousands and thousands ... Only absolute evil can steal children of another people. And, going against Ukrainians, Russian invaders destroy all other national communities that will live on the land of Ukraine for centuries. Therefore, the confirmation is burned by the Russians of the village of Greek-Christians and the systemic repression of Russia against the Crimean Tatar people-our Ukrainian Muslim community.
Iran's people could live quite differently if you were not put on one side with a break like Russian aggression.
Your "chess", which terrorizes Ukraine every night, means only that people are pushing even deeper and deeper on the dark side of history.
Glory to all who protect their lives!
Thank you all in the world who helps to strengthen our air defense, our aviation and the rescue people from Russian terror!
Let's be strong - we will live!
Glory to Ukraine!

 About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar wrote in telegrams.
More than a year of full -scale war.
The enormous path of vaccination against Russian info. We learned to cut and feel even between the lines of their insidiousness.
It seemed that this rule already subconsciously works for everyone - we believe in official sources.
We do not believe the impersonal sources of information - when there is neither a name nor a name of the Institution, nor other identifying features. When you just don't know who was the census.
But the larger the beacon, the more they believe.
The Russians write in telegrams that have happened to our Glavcom.
And what? Well, let them write.
We have denied it - repeatedly. He does his job. And it does not bypass fakes, as well as other commander of which enemies write inventions.
We do not substitute doubles.
The Russians just test their IPSO.

In Bakhmat itself, our troops have active assault actions, but in the Podomstizarase - it is really the first advancement, and in the last few days it is a specialized square kilometers that we have returned and do not lose, gradually overpowered.
In the very place, the enemy concentrated a huge number of troops, people of and arms-now they again brought there landing and assault detachments, so tamcitation is complicated. But they came here like a mousetrap.
When they lose, they simply destroy all objects, equating them in a Itly way in the land - actually squeeze our armed forces with a stand -alone artillery fire. They did so in Syria. They are their style.
It must be granted that every meter, where our defenders and defenders are in Bakhmut, they are worth ten kilometers of complexity of combat missions. And ours there is moving contrary to the fact that more power is more and in the number of troops and arms.
It speaks of two things - the courage, the indomitability of our warriors, and we all have a grammatically planned command of the Bakhmut direction - Hannamaars noted.
