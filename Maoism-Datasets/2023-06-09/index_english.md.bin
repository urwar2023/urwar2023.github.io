They are afraid of the destruction of the Dam of the Kyiv Aquarius. If something happens to her - a large number of people will die. " The Russian propagandist stated in. Solovyov.

The Center for Combating Misinformation on its Official Facebook page [reports](https://www.facebook.com/protydiyadezinformatsiyi.cpd/posts/pfbid028Hb4RHHAGL4DV6kneiqgbqwUXFbCyzKZpez7bauvr1J4NJ9uQv5m9EKokjSxpNG8l)that the inaccuracy of the Russian Federation before the blasting of the Dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant is the main Narrative of Russian propaganda media.

The Putin propagandist also stated that the situation with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station was not common with the interests of the Russian Federation.

"Despite the fact that the hydroelectric power plant has been replaced and undermined by the Russian accumulators, the Kremlin and the media under it continue to promote the narrative of the Russian Federation to blast the dam," the statement said.

In addition, in order to demoralize Ukrainian society and sow fear in the eyes of the people, propagandists began to mention in their conversations about the dam of the Kiev Damage.

Realizing the inevitability of its defeat, the Kremlin regime does not leave the attempt to simulate the Ukrainian authorities before negotiations under the terrorist conditions of the Russian Federation.

About it [reports](https://t.me/Koord_shtab/1194)Coordination headquarters of inquiries for the treatment of prisoners of war.

The aggressor country is constantly working on creating social tension among families. It takes various measures and provocations for this purpose.

‚ÄúFor example, they can be given to the exchange of a guy who is only a month in captivity, when there are people who are already there for more than a year. We do not give up a nivid of whom. We do not have such moral law. We take away everyone, ‚Äùthe representative of the headquarters explained. - When we form a negotiation position, we give preference to the first place seriously wounded, seriously ill, and those who are the longest time. "

The headquarters also stressed that the main principle of work is an uniqueness.

"We will never put any part or unit above, but someone below. More in captivity in one place can be different defenders: there will be sitting in the chamber of both the Marines, the Guards, and the border guards," he said.

Some participants of the meeting were interested in why, when there is an official confirmation of the Polonivida of Russia through the International Committee of the Red Cross, the defenders are still non -existent.

"Unfortunately, confirmation of captivity is not a guarantee that a person is exchanged at the next time," said the headquarters. - The same can be said as a storage. Natives spend a lot of efforts to find the place of keeping their defenders in captivity. Their concern is clear, but while we are looking, they can move the person to another place. Moreover, when such information is in public space in public space. "

The staff representative also warned the scammers who are called volunteers and collect money for captured. The coordination headquarters must be reported about such cases.

‚ÄúI had a conversation with Jens Stoltenberg about the future NATO summit. In general, it makes sense for the Alliance to take a decisive step towards Ukraine's membership.

The Security Service has collected a evidence of another participant in the DNR terrorist organization, which fought on the side of the aggressor country and committed the crimes of the counter-residents of Kherson region.

Together with the Russian troops, he actively participated in the captured kakhovka and robbing of local dwellings in 2022. During robbery, he used weapons and threatened murder in the event of resistance.

In this way, the racists "brought out" from the premises of citizens everything - from household appliances to money and other valuable things.

The attacker was captured by Ukrainian defenders last December during the Kherson direction.

According to the materials of the Ukrainian special service, the court appointed him 15 years in prison.

As the investigation was established, a fighter was a resident of Donetsk, who at the beginning of a full-scale invasion initiatively joined the ranks of the 9th Regiment of the Marine Infantry of the 1st Army Corps of the Russian Federation.

While in the post of Senior Sagittarius of the enemy unit, he fired the defense forces on the Eastern Front.

He was later transferred to a temporarily captured part of Kherson region.

On the basis of the evidence collected, the court found the attacker guilty of three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:

* Part 1 of Art. 438(violation of the laws and customs of war); * h. 2 s. 111(a state betrayal committed in a state of martial law); * h 5 p. 260(Participation in the activities not provided by law of armed formations).

This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the All -Ukrainian Agrarian Council Denis Marchuk during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.

"The South for us has always traditionally grown such oil cultures as a media, rapeseed, soybean, because there was a lot of sunshine even [watering](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voda)\- Ideal conditions to collect much more than in other territories of Ukraine. I think that after the de -occupation of agricultural producers will look for crop rotation and any international technologies, "he said.

Marchuk noted that Ukrainian agrarians can take over US experience, which in some states also work in a similar number.

The expert stressed that agriculture in the southern regions of the country will not stop even in the absence of irrigation. According to Marchuk, all the lands that are in this region use melioration. For example, about 300 thousand hectares of land irrigates in Kherson region, and the acreage is almost 1 million hectares.

"In the conditions without water, it is very difficult to talk about profitability, so those who will turn and want to engage in agriculture will probably simply increase the number of crops. What will give birth, then will give birth," - said Var.

In his opinion, the problem of lack of irrigation can be solved by the use of the use of well technology. Marchuk explained that it will be able to use those entrepreneurs whose business is located near the water, so these will be the case.

The expert noted that the agricultural business in the southern regions will have to support the Ukrainian state at the expense of special programs and subsidies. The most opinion, agricultural producers in the region will be able to reorient the business business, in particular, to engage in greenhouse farms.

According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, water supply of 31 irrigation systems of the fields of Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions will be stopped as a result of the underwriting.

The deputy head of the OP recalled that from April 3 to June 1, President Vladimirzelensky and the team made four visits in ten countries, among those violated in negotiations - the formula of peace.

"More than 20 countries have already chosen the point or points that they are ready to coordinate," he informed.

Zhovkva "with caution" noted that at the formula of peace may be some leaders of the Arab world.

At the same time, he added that the popularity of the formula points depends on the region: someone is interested in food safety, and someone is ecology.

‚ÄúSaudi Arabia, for example, is interesting to coordinate food safety. Taxama to other Gulf countries. There were a meeting with the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Iraq. All of them are interested in food safety, ‚Äùsaid the deputy head OP.

He also hoped that after a Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya hessva, Latin America or Asia will be expressed in interest to the eighth point, which is about ecology.

‚ÄúYes, ideas about some peace plans are being made. Brazilian, African proposals. Recently, Indonesia's Defense Minister suggested something. But formular regarding Ukraine should only be Ukrainian, because the war continues in Ukraine. We are ready to listen to everyone. And if something coincides with our understanding, they are ready to accept it. But there will be no separate, Brazilian or African plane. Only the Ukrainian formula will be the best, most effective plan of peace in Ukraine, ‚Äùsaid the deputy head of the OP.During a speech at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, in May, Zelenky suggested that Ulipna gather an international summit dedicated to the Ukrainian formula of peace.

The deputy head of the OP added that mutually transfers with NATO states on the battlefield, mastering the most modern equipment sometimes better than the Alliance's army member states, according to the Pentagon and other relevant identity.

Zhovkva expects that such an algorithm will be given in Vilnius to Ukraine.

"Otherwise, this will send another very strong but negative signal from the members of the aggressor country: you see, more than a year of war, a year of the aftermaddride summit, and there is no answer to Ukraine," he added."In the decision of the Madrid summit, there was a line:" Invite Finland and Sweden to NATO "and further, after the point:" To date, the household, the security of Sweden and Finland is important for all Member States. " This is not Article 5. We do not require Article 5 until the moment of membership. The best guarantee of our security is NATO membership. However, by the time, clear security security guarantees must be assigned to a multilateral document on paper, in parallel with bilateral agreements, ‚Äù - said.

According to him, it should be a multilateral framework document such as the Yermak-Rusmussen Group, which will be the basis, and then they can "string" bilateral security agreements. states.

"However, the summit needs to adopt such a framework multilateral document with NATO countries that will express your desire," Zhovkva emphasized.

He explained that guarantees are those actions that are already carried out in relation to Ukraine, including through the provision of weapons, macro -financial assistance, preservation and strengthening of sanctions against Russia, but they must be clear and systematic.

So that after the track there is not even the desire of the aggressor to restore aggression. And if the desire suddenly comes up - we can expect everything from Russia - then they understand the price of such aggression, ‚Äù - said the deputy head of the OP.

At the same time, the question whether many countries spoke guarantees, and the nurture: ‚ÄúMany. We work with four: US, UK, Germany, France. Some other countries do not mind joining. But we will not open the picture. "

As reported by Ukrinform, in November 2021, President Vladimir Zelensky signed the Law "On Prevention of Threats of National Security, associated with the impact of persons who have significant economic or political weight of the consuming life(oligarchs)".

The document provides a legal framework to separate the large business of the policy struggle and to limit the destructive influence of the privileged(oligarchic)interests in the economic life of Ukraine. It also establishes criteria for the determination of oligarchs and requirements for transparency of contacts of political actors and officials with oligarchs or their representatives.On June 29, 2022, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy introduced the decision [NSDC](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rnbo)on the register of oligarchs, the procedure for its formation and maintenance, signing the relevant decree.

In March 2023, Mart3 stated that the only barrier to the implementation of the law on oligarchs is the requirement of the European Commission to wait for the conclusion of the Venice Commission after the analysis of this law.

According to her, to talk about the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, more information is needed directly from the place. But referring to Olenukravchenko, who is the executive director, the board of the Board of the Organization "Ecology-Right-human"(Apple), Mehta noted that "this" ecocide "threatens" unprecedented [ecological](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekologia)consequences. "

In particular, it is about garbage contamination, dangerous chemicals, mass death of fish, shellfish and other aquatic species.

‚ÄúThe use of the term‚Äú ecocide ‚Äùis important because very often the environmental damage caused during armed conflicts is not given due attention. It is clear that both the media and the legal authorities are often focused on the direct harm to people, the harm of infrastructure, etc. many years or decades after the conflict is completed. Therefore, the name of the environmental harm of ecocide reflects this seriousness and means that it is perceived as seriously as it should be, ‚Äù - said themechta.

"First of all, the destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam indicates that the time has come to an international level of ecocide to solve the most serious cases of ecological destruction, where and if they would not be unacceptable," Mehta stressed.

According to Ukrinform, this is reported on the website of the Iceland Government.

Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the Russian ambassador to inform him about this decision.

"This is a difficult decision because Iceland has maintained rich relations with people from the moment of independence in 1944. However, the current -state simply does not allow the small diplomatic service of Iceland in Russia," the Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs Bridis Hilfadottir said.

Iceland has eighteen bilateral embassies in foreign capitals, determining the priority of their location in accordance with the scale of economic, political and cultural ties or cooperation for development.

Thus, the preservation of the work of the Embassy of Iceland in Moscow is not justified.

The decision to suspend the work of the Embassy of Iceland in Moscow is not a breakdiplomatic relations. As soon as the conditions are allowed, Iceland will prioritize the work of the embassy in Moscow.

Foreign Minister of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleb [called on](http://nofollow)Other states to follow the example of Iceland, which suspended the work of the Embassy of Vomskwa and requested the restriction of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Iceland.

‚ÄúI am grateful to Bordis Gilfadotur for the decision of Iceland to suspend the work of the Posson in Moscow and to ask Russia for restriction of the work of its police in Reykjavik. Russia should see that barbarism leads to complete isolation. I urge other states to follow the example of Iceland, ‚Äù - said Kubuleba.

This was reported by the chairman of the company Vladimir Kudrytsky in the essential telephony "The only news", Ukrinform reports.

‚ÄúIt seems to me that the liberalization of the market will lead to the fact that in some hours the price can rise higher than it is now, in others - below. And we can get to a situation where such liberalization is a change or abolition of these limits - it may not lead to a significant increase in value. In any case, the population does not feel it. It is a question of wholesale price, which is paid by small, medium and big business. We do not expect price shocks, ‚Äùhe said.

Kudrytsky added that such liberalization is likely to adjust the flow of imports [electricity](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-elektroenergia)From Europe to Ukraine, that it takes place at the time, when the Ukrainian power system needs it most.

According to Ukrinform, it reports [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/world/europe/ukraine-dam-collapse-explosion.html).

According to the official, [satellites](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-suputnik), equipped with infrared sensors, found signs of heat that corresponds to a severing explosion just before the rowing collapse.

The official, on the face of anonymity, said that analysts of American intelligence are subordinating that Russia is the destruction of the dam. However, he added that US intelligence still does not have any convincing evidence of responsible strokes.

"Experts on equipment and ammunition have stated that a deliberate explosion at the Kakhovskaya Gundle, which is controlled by Russia, was likely to have caused its collapse of insertion," the statement said.

Experts added that a structural failure or an attack from the outside of the dam is also possible, and Alesla would take many times more explosives.

This is stated in the message of the organization Greenpeace transmitted by Ukrinform.

‚ÄúThe long-term occupation of the ZPPC is jeopardizing nuclear safety with any emergency intervention, if a crisis is caused by damage to the Dambielectrostation. Such damage can be both inadant, due to increased water pressure and the consequence of criminal acting on the part of Russian troops. The Russian occupation should be immediately attracted, and Ukrainian control over the station is restored, ‚Äù - said UGRENEENPEACE.

As it is noted, the greatest concern is the fact that the cooler of Nazaposhzhzhza nuclear power plant is under threat of the leakage of a hypotentive collapse, if the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir is drawn. The Ukrainian authorities said it was expected to fall up to 3 meters of the week from 17.4 meters, as it was before the destruction of the Kakhovska Damba as a result of Russia's actions. Such a fall in water levels increases the pressure [water](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voda)On the walls of the dam- the pond- cooler electricity.

The soreness of the cooler pond will significantly complicate the supply of necessary coolant for six reactors and the waste nuclear fuel of the assignment, emphasized in Greenpeace.

According to Greenpeace, the Russian occupation of the Zaporozhye atomic power, in particular by military forces and Rosatom, seriously interferes with Ukrainian nuclear staff to perform their important safety functions. They work in extremely difficult conditions.

The invaders wanted to blackmail Ukraine with the blasting of the dam and staged a technogenic crash in the south of our country.

He also describes the consequences of this catastrophe that try to hide in the Russian Federation: increasing water levels, flooding of territories and destruction.

‚ÄúHaving undermined the dam of Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, the Russian Federation has finally proved that it is a thug for the entire civilized world. After all, only a real state-terrorist can arrange a man-made and environmental disaster of this level. And it will be necessary to answer it - both on the battlefield and in international courts. Agenda - to hold not only the top of the Putin regime, but also ordinary perpetrators of crimes, ‚Äùsaid SBU chairman Vasyl Malyuk.

We would like to remind you that the Security Service of Ukraine opened criminal proceedings with a pocketing of the Russian Crime of the Russian Federation. The investigation was launched under two articles of the Criminal Code - violations of the laws and customs of war and ecocide.

The war is not without loss. The worst but inevitable losses are humans. And unfortunately, they have not yet created military equipment that cannot be destroyed. And current wars are giving in two dimensions - real and informational.

This [noted](https://t.me/annamaliar/824)Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in Telegrams.

‚ÄúIn the information fight are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, the rules of Izacon, ‚Äùshe said.

For example, any side of the armed conflict seeks to show the loss of the opponent and classes its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Because the more information about the enemy is opened, the easier it is to calculate his or her disability and plans.

‚ÄúIn addition to intelligence, and the Russians are now very complicated in our territory, there are shrubs to extract the necessary information through throwing in infostirproproups. In this way, you can make the other side give as much information about yourself as possible. For example, because of the incentive to justify the tricks, ‚Äùthe Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.

To do this, as Anna Malyar summarizes, very high numbers in the hope that the Ukrainians will be indignant will begin to refute and issue any data or indirect orientation on them.

‚ÄúFor example, information about the disappearance of the Glavcom or other commander- in anticipation of comments and denials of demonstration on photo-tavideolocations- where they really are. Therefore, it should be understood that we are fighting information, like the enemy, ‚Äùsaid Anna Malyar.

The basis of these stories, and specifically one of them, which is called "letters of irritation", is organized today's performance. These stories describe my fate, and different people who have been tested by occupation and war ... Izhiv and dead. This is Kherson's manifesto for free Ukraine, to free world, - said Artem Petryk.

### ** Lithuania is the main and consistent ally of Ukraine **

The historian shared that the decision to hold an event on the territory of the Lithuanian Poland is symbolic for him, because he himself lived and worked in Lithuania for a long time and is its researcher.

- Lithuania is the main and consistent ally of Ukraine. Since 2014, it has been continuous assistance to Ukraine, both military and humanitarian. In general, historically, the Lithuanian state has always supported the national liberation movement. I can say that the Lithuanians have gone a similar path. The idea of creating a perfomania in this place belongs to the main chaplain of the forces of TE Sergiudmitriev and director Akhtem Seitablaev, - said Artem Petryk.

![](Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T40-00-00-04-00/foto-3-5.jpg)The main chaplain of the forces TE Sergey Dmitriev told why he decided to organize perfomanias on the basis of the Lithuanian Embassy and how important it is for Kherson.

- My service began with the Kherson region, on March 13, 2014. Therefore, Kherson is a sense for me is a hometown. Once the author of the book, Artem Petrick, was my student - a parishioner. Since I am friends with the Lithuanian police, and Artem is a representative of the University of Klaipeda, the idea of showing this performance was there. Of course, it is also another opportunity to show the real partners and diplomats real stories of real people, - said Sergey Dmitriev.

He also reported that this event is an opportunity to raise funds for the aid of the Churchson suffering from the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Exploanary.

According to Sergius, now two chaplains from Kherson TRO on boats are rescuing people and transporting food in a flooded city.

![](Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T50-00-00-04-00/fuez5wmxsaifrtm.jpg)Today's night air attack was no different from other raids, which is traveled to the territory of Ukraine. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a story of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, about it during the only news.

He noted that from 23:00 the enemy was attacking Kamikadze drone, then winged rockets, and in the morning it can apply balconia. The May attacks were focused on the capital where there are priority goals for the enemy, which is why a larger percentage of goals was destroyed over Kiev. Today's attack is mostly the dispersal of the attention of the Ukrainian air defense system.

-This time, the occupiers sent both Kamikadze drones and reconnaissance UAVs to track the air environment, and rockets that actually flew circles and laid out the course. The purpose of such actions is to sow panic in Ukrainians, as well as to take the attention of our air defense and explain its weaknesses. Shahda uses enemy to be used to exhaust the ammunition and to feel the weaknesses of our anti -missile defense. The rockets that are launched in a single premium, then change this direction, and later return to where they came, the Russians also want to mislead us. Of course, we destroy these rocket routes of their following. Yes, 4 of 6 winged air base missiles-101/X-55 was shot today,-said Yuri Ignat.

The Air Force spokesman pointed out that, in addition to the X-101 missiles, he was a mastery of the X-55 missile, which is the bearer of tactical nuclear charges. These missiles are often used by the enemy as a false target without charge to increase the number of missiles without using the X-101, and in order for the Ukrainian air defense to work.

- Such signs may indicate that the enemy may save his reserve and want to spend anti -aircraft missiles on her, - the officer emphasized.

Colonel Yuri Ignat also noted that lifting into the air to the enemy of the jersey, in particular the MiG-31K, which is the carrier of "daggers", as well as periodic dissemination of strategic aviation is done for training flights, as well as checking the technical condition of aircraft and their systems.

- In addition, the Russians are well aware that, raising aviation into the sky, they panic among Ukrainians and destabilize the situation, - added Yuri Ignat.

Patrushev also stated that "the peoples of Ukraine and Russia are not interested in the conflict."

The power of the terrorist country continues to exist in parallel reality and to submit a narrative, as if Ukrainians and Russians-"brotherly peoples" who want to be in peace.

In addition, this narrative is sometimes transformed into a "single people".

Such statements of the Russian Federation continue to deny the existence of Ukraine as a separate subject and to offset Ukrainian statehood.

About it [informs](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-zdobula-ostatochnu-peremogu-u-spravi-shodo-povernen-83501)Office of the President of Ukraine.

Immediately after the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia launched a campaign from deprivation of Ukraine's national cultural heritage, initiated with the help of substantive "Crimean museums" the trial in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The aggressor country demanded to transfer to the peninsula a collection of so-called Scythian gold, which had previously been at the exhibition at the Alesterdam Museum of Allard Pearson.

For almost nine years, the legal struggle in the courts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has lasted. Russia did not spare resources during attempts to illegally appropriation of Ukraine's cultural values. But all the courts of the Netherlands rejected any "Crimean museums" on the "Scythian gold" and made the decision of the Russian.

Ukraine expresses gratitude to the kingdom of the Netherlands for ensuring unbiased objective justice and for steady support for the international justice.

We are waiting for the return of "Scythian gold" home, to Ukraine!

_ ‚ÄúUkrainians who have unique ideas that could significantly strengthen the domestic defense sector are not always well informed. In combination with bureaucracy, this leads to the use of our resources at a minimum, ‚Äùsaid then the office.

_Pramena stubbornness in the introduction of the latest developments is a problem that exists not only in Ukraine. As a tool for accelerating the corresponding processes, our Western partners have organized in their countries accelerator innovations._

We have to create a Ukrainian accounter for the present challenges and threats. Because we need to accelerate in technological development, __ accelerate the introduction of_orobon innovation._

_ What will work ** accelerator of innovative development of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine **, read in our material.__

### ** "We will convince the skeptics that they broke the bureaucratic barriers of the erection of technical innovation movement to the army" **

![](Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T70-00-00-04-00/0c3185c43dda2e217a41331f22d018fad7a07e33.jpeg)- The accelerator is the process of processes in the Ministry of Defense system. We have a "single entrance window" for anyone who wants to offer an important, useful - new patterns of weapons and military equipment(OVT. - Ed.), interesting technical solutions. We are open not only for OVT-related developments, we are open as a whole for enterprises, specialists, investors, for anyone who is desirable to work with the Ministry of Defense, to strengthen our defense capability, to offer innovative solutions, not only technical, for the victory of Ukraine,-says the coordinator. Initiatives for the creation of the Ministry of Defense accelerator Sergey Loboyko.

According to him, the Ministry of Defense team is ready to cooperate with technical communities, associations of enterprises, clusters, volunteer movements.

- Skeptics who claim that in the current environment it is unrealistic to accelerate: register with us and see how the new system works. There are already twenty enterprises that have passed all the stages - from the submission of the project to the introduction of vexplaination - in fact in record time. A few dozen companies are in the process. All applications are currently being considered very quickly. If the enterprise is prompted by a high degree of readiness, then we fit into the declarationermina, - adds Sergey Loboyko.Representatives of the Ministry of Defense accelerator said that if the enterprise has a certain "mature" development, then you should submit an official letter together with the TTC and the document to submit the previous tests. Also, the accelerator will ask for information in prohibition advantages: technological, economic, combat. The process is then. ** and will last no more than 45 days!**

In some cases, additional tests may need to be conducted, then it will take more time.

For comparison, before this process lasted about 2 years.

### ** "If at least one of the Armed Forces Command is interested in ** ** a certain sample of arms then all processes will happen very quickly" **

The accelerator team states that all stages of the above processes are now on -automated and transparent, easily track the course of documents or at what stage the process has slowed down.

The complete implementation of the concept of the "single window" created by the accelerator will make the revolution in the processes of prompt implementation of new OVT samples for our Army.

- If at least one of the commands of the Armed Forces is interested in a certain model of weapons of a certain enterprise, then all processes will happen very quickly. Handy, we have enough "horizontal" country, and everyone knows each other, communicate. As a rule, those who have already tested some pilot projects on our doors on our doors. Therefore, as a result, all this also gives an opportunity. For if something goes to us(New development. - Ed.), then we immediately send it to commands. And, as a rule, they reagate quite quickly, - said the initiative coordinator to create acceleratoramic enopens Sergey Loboyko.

Sergei adds that with the help of an accelerator the Ministry of Defense plans to attract specialists in his team:

- We will declare a call for anyone who has serious experience in the management of projects, who has serious analytical competencies, perhaps communication competences. We will urge such specialists to submit a resume. If it is a mobilized carrier, then we will consider the possibility of transferring it to our commission. We also consider civilian experts as candidates for cooperation.

It should also be reported that the accelerator of innovative development of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is establishing cooperation with the accelerator of defensive innovations as of the North Atlantic(DIANA).

The Ukrainian team also communicates with the British accelerator(DASA).–í–µ–¥—É—Ç—å—Å—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∏ –∑ –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—ñ—î—é —Ç–∞ —Å–∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω–∞–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞–º–∏. –ü–ª–∞–Ω—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—Å–ø—ñ–≤–ø—Ä–∞—Ü—è –∑ –∞–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∫–æ–ª–µ–≥–∞–º–∏.

About it [stated](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/russias-heinous-and-desperate-actions-demonstrate-that-it-knows-the-invasion-has-failed-uk-statement-to-the-osce)The UK representative in the OSCE, military advisor Stabbs.

According to him, the intellectually bankrupt address of the Kremlin to the grueling war testifies to his horrific willingness to sacrifice the Russian people.

‚ÄúThe long attempts by Russia to break the will and determination of the Ukrainian people with repeated ropes and attacks of drones in cities and settlements throughout Ukraine with pathetic and disgusting actions. These are desperate actions of Russian warlords who have exhausted ideas that constantly overestimate their strength and underestimate the power and determination of the Ukrainian people, ‚ÄùJan Stabbs stressed.

He added that at the beginning of a large-scale offensive of Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 20122, one of the goals was the full capture of the entire Donbass region for 10-14 days. However, after 15 months, the offensive of Russia in eastern Ukraine stopped the value of extremely high losses.

‚ÄúFor more than a year, we have observed how those who make decisions double their other unhappy plan in case of unforeseen circumstances - a meaningless, intellectually bankrupt appeal to a grueling war. This has led to the Kremlin's readiness to sacrifice the Russian people, including his mobilized citizens, thousands in the name of Putin's terrible and super -fetched. Our Russian colleague insists that such a "military special operation" is being conducted that all goals will be achieved. We all know that the war chosen by Putin in Ukraine is built on a lie, but a reality: a slowdrolling invasion of Russia, thousands of losses of Russians and significant deterioration of Russia's capacity clearly demonstrate that this is not true at all, ‚ÄùJanstabbs said.

He just had a bet. The situation on the forefront is the main attention. Reports - teams of operational directions, head, GUR, Ministry of Defense, Minds Strategy, Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Attention is focused on all areas where our actions are needed and where the enemy can be disassembled. Our defensive actions, active actions, our achievements of the front.

They discussed the supply and distribution of ammunition, strengthening of our artillery and air defense.

He spoke today with Japan and the Netherlands. I informed the rescue operation in the southern areas, about our urgent needs. The readiness to help Ukraine is, and I am grateful to partners. There are decisions on humanitarian support.

With Mr. Prime Minister of Japan, they discussed the preparation of the Global Peace Summit Conference in Japan on the reconstruction and transformation of our country of post-fighting.

With Mr. Prime Minister of the Netherlands, we talked about our further defense work, coordinated our positions in front of the next Ramstein. We move by step in strengthening our air shield. They discussed the Petriots coalition, our pilots training.

There is a very important decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the Scythian Gold Collection. Ukrainian collection. Collections stored in our Krym, but which cannot yet be returned to the Crimea for an obvious reason: it can be given to the occupier, a robber.

Of course, it will be in Crimea, when there will be a Ukrainian flag in the Crimea. Actually, such logic was confirmed by the Higher Judiciary of the Netherlands. And this is the alternatives that the Dutch, people, the Dutch society and the state can be the leaders in protecting the rule of law and values of civilization.

I thank everyone who fought for this decision, our team of ministry, who worked for the sake of this result. Justice - step by step - will protect.

There is also a new defense package from the United States for more than $ 2 million. Petriots rockets and other air defense systems, strengthening our defense on Earth, increasing the strength of all our soldiers. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you both parties of Congress and all Americans who want freedom won as well as Ukrainians.A tremendous number of problems. But we work on overcoming them at all possible levels. And most importantly, there is now social potential to do so.

Take care of each other, work in unity, protect people and life. These are our print, the principles of Ukraine. They now act on one hundred percent prices. And I am sure that it would be difficult, we will overcome the consequences of this catastrophe, and all Russian evil.

I thank everyone in the world who already helps and who asks in Ukraine how to help. I thank everyone who is already involved in the rescue operation, who as possible helps people. People, animals, all living things. I thank all who are inducting international organizations, foreign leaders, other states to see what happened, and to name things by their names. Russian terrorists should be in accordance with what they had done.

And separately - for our soldiers, for all who these days are in particularly heavy battles.

We see your heroism, and we are grateful to you for every minute of your life - life is really a life of Ukraine. Because Ukraine is as free as you, our own, are strong. Ukraine is so protected as you, our warriors, are effective.

Everyone and everyone who is fighting is Ukraine that is fighting. Thank you for it!Glory to everyone who is fighting and working for our country!

The protesters demand the resignation of the Interior Minister Serbiibratislav Hashich and the head of the secret service Alexandar Vulin, whom they accuse that they have not been prosecuted by criminal groups.

They also want to deprive national licenses for broadcasting Pinktv and Happy TV and ban some tabloids accused of propaganda.

"I expect the protest to continue because there is no other path," said the protesters who called the police. "I think that one moment will have to give in, it is a large number of people, and in the end they will be less likely to yield to this pressure."

According to Ukrinform correspondent, the Minister of Natural Natural Resources of Canada Jonathan Vilkinson said this in Ottawa.

"The calculations indicate that the area of forest destroyed will double up to 2050, given climate changes that cause longer and more intense seasonal fires, more extreme weather conditions and increased drought," Vilkinson said.

About it reports Ukrinform with reference to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/serbians-take-streets-anti-government-protests-following-mass-shootings-2023-06-09/).

Scingling "Vuchich Down!", Refusing President Serbia, and holding the Great Bainer with the inscription "Students Against Violence", protesters gathered pre -parliament and marched to the government.

The protesters demand the resignation of the Interior Minister Serbiibratislav Hashich and the head of the secret service Alexandar Vulin, whom they accuse that they have not been prosecuted by criminal groups.

They also want to deprive national licenses for broadcasting Pinktv and Happy TV and ban some tabloids accused of propaganda.

"I expect the protest to continue because there is no other path," said the protesters who called the police. "I think that one moment will have to give in, it is a large number of people, and in the end they will be less likely to yield to this pressure."

Prime Minister Ana Brnabich said on Wednesday that she was ready to resign, and resolved opposition parties that supported the protests to the dialogue. But leader stated that they would not communicate with the government until all the requirements are fulfilled.

The Serbian President, however, believes that his government is not responsible for the state. "Is the government guilty of crimes that have happened? I can't agree with it," he said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.
