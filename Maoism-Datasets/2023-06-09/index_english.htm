In this way, they will be able to form an excerpt on the state registration of the birth of the person and his origin.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dmsu.gov.ua/posts/pfbid0384Uu1jp3RxLhKtpX5V3X8NeCqWQJS2vF9LHQzKHDQme5qkv5Lo77rRuwuwu15HM5l">writes</a>On its official Facebook page the State Migration Service of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Therefore, the procedure of obtaining passport documents is greatly simplified for citizens. In addition, it will allow Ukrainians who have left the temporarily occupied territories abroad through the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, faster to apply for their passports.</p>
<p>This innovation will optimize the work of the LCA bodies and allow you to significantly scribble the time of processing requests for passports.</p>

<p>The head of Ukrainian diplomacy <a href="https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1666477407350448141">reported</a>Obliga Twitter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had a conversation with Jens Stoltenberg about the future NATO summit. In general, it makes sense for the Alliance to take a decisive step towards Ukraine's membership. We are not NATO's aspiration on the battlefield to put an end to this war. We strive to get the best guarantees to prevent future wars, ‚Äùhe wrote.</p>
<p>Dmytro Kuleba stressed that in fifteen years the reality has changed dramatically, and NATO's approach should also change.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe difference between 2008 and the present time is that Ukraine is now a valuable asset for the Alliance, not passive. Ukraine will make NATO stronger, ‚Äùhe will be in his post.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine also emphasized the stable provision of nursing ammunition to ensure the effectiveness of the counter -offensive operations of Ukraine, noting that the future of Ukraine but the Euro -Atlantic community is now being solved on the battlefield.</p>
<p>In addition, to mitigate the crisis caused by the destruction of Kakhovskaya Damba, Jens Stoltenberg promised that NATO mechanisms will be used to provide humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>"In this regard, he will head tomorrow the emergency meeting of the Ukraine-Ukraine, called at my request," Dmytro Kuleba added.</p>

<p>This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the All -Ukrainian Agrarian Council Denis Marchuk during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"The South for us has always traditionally grown such oil cultures as a media, rapeseed, soybean, because there was a lot of sunshine even <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voda">watering</a>- Ideal conditions to collect much more than in other territories of Ukraine. I think that after the de -occupation of agricultural producers will look for crop rotation and any international technologies, "he said.</p>
<p>Marchuk noted that Ukrainian agrarians can take over US experience, which in some states also work in a similar number.</p>
<p>The expert stressed that agriculture in the southern regions of the country will not stop even in the absence of irrigation. According to Marchuk, all the lands that are in this region use melioration. For example, about 300 thousand hectares of land irrigates in Kherson region, and the acreage is almost 1 million hectares.</p>
<p>"In the conditions without water, it is very difficult to talk about profitability, so those who will turn and want to engage in agriculture will probably simply increase the number of crops. What will give birth, then will give birth," - said Var.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the problem of lack of irrigation can be solved by the use of the use of well technology. Marchuk explained that it will be able to use those entrepreneurs whose business is located near the water, so these will be the case.</p>
<p>The expert noted that the agricultural business in the southern regions will have to support the Ukrainian state at the expense of special programs and subsidies. The most opinion, agricultural producers in the region will be able to reorient the business business, in particular, to engage in greenhouse farms.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, water supply of 31 irrigation systems of the fields of Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions will be stopped as a result of the underwriting. In 2021, these systems provided for 584 thousand hectares, of which farmers harvested about 4 million tonnes of grain and grain crops worth about $ 1.5 billion.</p>

<p>Zhovkva "with caution" noted that at the formula of peace may be some leaders of the Arab world.</p>
<p>At the same time, he added that the popularity of the formula points depends on the region: someone is interested in food safety, and someone is ecology.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSaudi Arabia, for example, is interesting to coordinate food safety. Taxama to other Gulf countries. There were a meeting with the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Iraq. All of them are interested in food safety, ‚Äùsaid the deputy head OP.</p>
<p>He also hoped that after a Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya hessva, Latin America or Asia will be expressed in interest to the eighth point, which is about ecology.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3719990-ssa-pracuut-iz-partnerami-nad-pidtrimkou-ukrainskoi-formuli-miru-brink.html)At the same time, Zhovkva noted that the Chinese side is still thinking about Ukraine's proposal to formula.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, ideas about some peace plans are being made. Brazilian, African proposals. Recently, Indonesia's Defense Minister suggested something. But formular regarding Ukraine should only be Ukrainian, because the war continues in Ukraine. We are ready to listen to everyone. And if something coincides with our understanding, they are ready to accept it. But there will be no separate, Brazilian or African plane. Only the Ukrainian formula will be the best, most effective plan of peace in Ukraine, ‚Äùsaid the deputy head of the OP.During a speech at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, in May, Zelenky suggested that Ulipna gather an international summit dedicated to the Ukrainian formula of peace.</p>

<p>This opinion was expressed in an exclusive comment to the correspondent of Ukrinform VGAAAZ executive director of the international organization Stop Ecocide International, also known as SEI, Jioje Menht.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam in Ukraine is catastrophic and emphasizes a significant prologue in international criminal law. It is time for, finally, to recognize the ecocid - a serious and large -scale or long -term environmental harm to the environment - an independent crime both in peacetime and during the conflict, ‚Äùshe said.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the international organization Stop Ecocide International seek to identify ecocide international crime. He emphasizes that ecocide is a serious damage to the environment or ecosystem, which threatens living things and can even lead to complete destruction of the long -lived environment. The organization wants to involve lawyers, experts, diplomats and all sectors of civil society to work so that the ecocide is recognized as an international crime.</p>

<p>According to her, according to Art. 441 of the Criminal Code, Ecocide - the mass destruction of the flora of the workpiece, poisoning of the atmosphere or water resources, as well as more actions that can cause environmental catastrophe - is punishable by deprivation for a term of eight to fifteen years.</p>

<p>According to her, to talk about the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, more information is needed directly from the place. But referring to Olenukravchenko, who is the executive director, the board of the Board of the Organization "Ecology-Right-human"(Apple), Mehta noted that "this" ecocide "threatens" unprecedented <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekologia">ecological</a>consequences. "</p>
<p>In particular, it is about garbage contamination, dangerous chemicals, mass death of fish, shellfish and other aquatic species.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe use of the term‚Äú ecocide ‚Äùis important because very often the environmental damage caused during armed conflicts is not given due attention. It is clear that both the media and the legal authorities are often focused on the direct harm to people, the harm of infrastructure, etc. many years or decades after the conflict is completed. Therefore, the name of the environmental harm of ecocide reflects this seriousness and means that it is perceived as seriously as it should be, ‚Äù - said themechta.</p>

<p>"First of all, the destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam indicates that the time has come to an international level of ecocide to solve the most serious cases of ecological destruction, where and if they would not be unacceptable," Mehta stressed.</p>

<p>At the same time, as officials reported, B-FAST staff will not go to Ukraine to participate in rescue operations. Belgium legislation prohibits the deployment of B-Fast staff in the war zone.

<p>This was reported by the chairman of the company Vladimir Kudrytsky in the essential telephony "The only news", Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt seems to me that the liberalization of the market will lead to the fact that in some hours the price can rise higher than it is now, in others - below. And we can get to a situation where such liberalization is a change or abolition of these limits - it may not lead to a significant increase in value. In any case, the population does not feel it. It is a question of wholesale price, which is paid by small, medium and big business. We do not expect price shocks, ‚Äùhe said.</p>
<p>Kudrytsky added that such liberalization is likely to adjust the flow of imports <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-elektroenergia">electricity</a>From Europe to Ukraine, that it takes place at the time, when the Ukrainian power system needs it most.</p>

<p>According to the official, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-suputnik">satellites</a>, equipped with infrared sensors, found signs of heat that corresponds to a severing explosion just before the rowing collapse.</p>
<p>The official, on the face of anonymity, said that analysts of American intelligence are subordinating that Russia is the destruction of the dam. However, he added that US intelligence still does not have any convincing evidence of responsible strokes.</p>

<p>Experts added that a structural failure or an attack from the outside of the dam is also possible, and Alesla would take many times more explosives.</p>

<p>This is stated in the message of the organization Greenpeace transmitted by Ukrinform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe long-term occupation of the ZPPC is jeopardizing nuclear safety with any emergency intervention, if a crisis is caused by damage to the Dambielectrostation. Such damage can be both inadant, due to increased water pressure and the consequence of criminal acting on the part of Russian troops. The Russian occupation should be immediately attracted, and Ukrainian control over the station is restored, ‚Äù - said UGRENEENPEACE.</p>
<p><em>Video: Greenpeace</em></p>
<p>As it is noted, the greatest concern is the fact that the cooler of Nazaposhzhzhza nuclear power plant is under threat of the leakage of a hypotentive collapse, if the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir is drawn. The Ukrainian authorities said it was expected to fall up to 3 meters of the week from 17.4 meters, as it was before the destruction of the Kakhovska Damba as a result of Russia's actions. Such a fall in water levels increases the pressure <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voda">water</a>On the walls of the dam- the pond- cooler electricity.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe topic must be promoted - this is the first step. We have now explained to the people: we have come about what we will work on.

<p>Kuleba expressed his belief that after breaking the topic of stolen children, Ukraine would quickly unpack the topic of civilian prisoners. He added that the authorities have worked out the steps for every international organization.</p>

<p>The war is not without loss. The worst but inevitable losses are humans. And unfortunately, they have not yet created military equipment that cannot be destroyed. And current wars are giving in two dimensions - real and informational.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/824">noted</a>Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in Telegrams.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the information fight are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, the rules of Izacon, ‚Äùshe said.</p>
<p>For example, any side of the armed conflict seeks to show the loss of the opponent and classes its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Because the more information about the enemy is opened, the easier it is to calculate his or her disability and plans.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn addition to intelligence, and the Russians are now very complicated in our territory, there are shrubs to extract the necessary information through throwing in infostirproproups. In this way, you can make the other side give as much information about yourself as possible. For example, because of the incentive to justify the tricks, ‚Äùthe Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.</p>
<p>To do this, as Anna Malyar summarizes, very high numbers in the hope that the Ukrainians will be indignant will begin to refute and issue any data or indirect orientation on them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, information about the disappearance of the Glavcom or other commander- in anticipation of comments and denials of demonstration on photo-tavideolocations- where they really are. Therefore, it should be understood that we are fighting information, like the enemy, ‚Äùsaid Anna Malyar.</p>

<p>"Wheeling Letters" - Perfomance, created on the basis of a book(Klaipeda University, Lithuania)Artem Petrick, who came to his parents in Kherson on the eve of the component component invasion of Russia and found himself in Vokupation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T40-00-00-04-00/foto-1-6.jpg" />Artem Petryk spent 9 months under the Russian occupation, during which he tried to note the Polytiks everything that happened with Kherson and his inhabitants. This is what the book "Dreams of Kherson", which included stories about the lives of ordinary Khrsonans, many of whom are no longer among the living.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortly before the large -scale invasion, I arrived from Lithuania to my parents to Kherson, so I was in occupation. In the spring, when the protesters of the invaders began, I thought that it was necessary to fix it all. Initially, these were ordinary notes that turned into a diary, which was then transformed into stories that were included in the collection "Dreams of Kherson". The basis of these stories, and specifically one of them, which is called "letters of irritation", is organized today's performance. These stories describe my fate, and different people who have been tested by occupation and war ... Izhiv and dead. This is Kherson's manifesto for free Ukraine, to free world, - said Artem Petryk.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> Lithuania is the main and consistent ally of Ukraine </strong></h3>
<p>The historian shared that the decision to hold an event on the territory of the Lithuanian Poland is symbolic for him, because he himself lived and worked in Lithuania for a long time and is its researcher.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lithuania is the main and consistent ally of Ukraine. Since 2014, it has been continuous assistance to Ukraine, both military and humanitarian. In general, historically, the Lithuanian state has always supported the national liberation movement. I can say that the Lithuanians have gone a similar path. The idea of creating a perfomania in this place belongs to the main chaplain of the forces of TE Sergiudmitriev and director Akhtem Seitablaev, - said Artem Petryk.</li>

<ul>
<li>My service began with the Kherson region, on March 13, 2014. Therefore, Kherson is a sense for me is a hometown. Once the author of the book, Artem Petrick, was my student - a parishioner. Since I am friends with the Lithuanian police, and Artem is a representative of the University of Klaipeda, the idea of showing this performance was there. Of course, it is also another opportunity to show the real partners and diplomats real stories of real people, - said Sergey Dmitriev.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also reported that this event is an opportunity to raise funds for the aid of the Churchson suffering from the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Exploanary.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T50-00-00-04-00/fuez5wmxsaifrtm.jpg" />Today's night air attack was no different from other raids, which is traveled to the territory of Ukraine. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a story of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, about it during the only news.</p>
<p>He noted that from 23:00 the enemy was attacking Kamikadze drone, then winged rockets, and in the morning it can apply balconia. The May attacks were focused on the capital where there are priority goals for the enemy, which is why a larger percentage of goals was destroyed over Kiev. Today's attack is mostly the dispersal of the attention of the Ukrainian air defense system.</p>
<p>-This time, the occupiers sent both Kamikadze drones and reconnaissance UAVs to track the air environment, and rockets that actually flew circles and laid out the course. The purpose of such actions is to sow panic in Ukrainians, as well as to take the attention of our air defense and explain its weaknesses. Shahda uses enemy to be used to exhaust the ammunition and to feel the weaknesses of our anti -missile defense. The rockets that are launched in a single premium, then change this direction, and later return to where they came, the Russians also want to mislead us. Of course, we destroy these rocket routes of their following. Yes, 4 of 6 winged air base missiles-101/X-55 was shot today,-said Yuri Ignat.</p>
<p>The Air Force spokesman pointed out that, in addition to the X-101 missiles, he was a mastery of the X-55 missile, which is the bearer of tactical nuclear charges. These missiles are often used by the enemy as a false target without charge to increase the number of missiles without using the X-101, and in order for the Ukrainian air defense to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such signs may indicate that the enemy may save his reserve and want to spend anti -aircraft missiles on her, - the officer emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Colonel Yuri Ignat also noted that lifting into the air to the enemy of the jersey, in particular the MiG-31K, which is the carrier of "daggers", as well as periodic dissemination of strategic aviation is done for training flights, as well as checking the technical condition of aircraft and their systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the Russians are well aware that, raising aviation into the sky, they panic among Ukrainians and destabilize the situation, - added Yuri Ignat.</li>

<p>Immediately after the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia launched a campaign from deprivation of Ukraine's national cultural heritage, initiated with the help of substantive "Crimean museums" the trial in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The aggressor country demanded to transfer to the peninsula a collection of so-called Scythian gold, which had previously been at the exhibition at the Alesterdam Museum of Allard Pearson.</p>
<p>For almost nine years, the legal struggle in the courts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has lasted. Russia did not spare resources during attempts to illegally appropriation of Ukraine's cultural values. But all the courts of the Netherlands rejected any "Crimean museums" on the "Scythian gold" and made the decision of the Russian.</p>
<p>Ukraine expresses gratitude to the kingdom of the Netherlands for ensuring unbiased objective justice and for steady support for the international justice.</p>
<p>We are waiting for the return of "Scythian gold" home, to Ukraine!</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ministry of Defense is now not just a consumer of products, but a partner in the development, production and supply of the best equipment and weapons for the best army in the world - the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

<p>_ ‚ÄúUkrainians who have unique ideas that could significantly strengthen the domestic defense sector are not always well informed. In combination with bureaucracy, this leads to the use of our resources at a minimum, ‚Äùsaid then the office.</p>
<p><em>Pramena stubbornness in the introduction of the latest developments is a problem that exists not only in Ukraine. As a tool for accelerating the corresponding processes, our Western partners have organized in their countries accelerator innovations.</em></p>
<p>We have to create a Ukrainian accounter for the present challenges and threats. Because we need to accelerate in technological development, __ accelerate the introduction of_orobon innovation._</p>
<p>_ What will work <strong> accelerator of innovative development of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine </strong>, read in our material.__</p>
<h3><strong> "We will convince the skeptics that they broke the bureaucratic barriers of the erection of technical innovation movement to the army" </strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-09T70-00-00-04-00/0c3185c43dda2e217a41331f22d018fad7a07e33.jpeg" />- The accelerator is the process of processes in the Ministry of Defense system. We have a "single entrance window" for anyone who wants to offer an important, useful - new patterns of weapons and military equipment(OVT. - Ed.), interesting technical solutions. We are open not only for OVT-related developments, we are open as a whole for enterprises, specialists, investors, for anyone who is desirable to work with the Ministry of Defense, to strengthen our defense capability, to offer innovative solutions, not only technical, for the victory of Ukraine,-says the coordinator. Initiatives for the creation of the Ministry of Defense accelerator Sergey Loboyko.</p>
<p>According to him, the Ministry of Defense team is ready to cooperate with technical communities, associations of enterprises, clusters, volunteer movements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skeptics who claim that in the current environment it is unrealistic to accelerate: register with us and see how the new system works. There are already twenty enterprises that have passed all the stages - from the submission of the project to the introduction of vexplaination - in fact in record time. A few dozen companies are in the process. All applications are currently being considered very quickly. If the enterprise is prompted by a high degree of readiness, then we fit into the declarationermina, - adds Sergey Loboyko.Representatives of the Ministry of Defense accelerator said that if the enterprise has a certain "mature" development, then you should submit an official letter together with the TTC and the document to submit the previous tests. Also, the accelerator will ask for information in prohibition advantages: technological, economic, combat. The process is then. <strong> and will last no more than 45 days!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, additional tests may need to be conducted, then it will take more time.</p>
<p>For comparison, before this process lasted about 2 years.</p>
<h3><strong> "If at least one of the Armed Forces Command is interested in </strong> <strong> a certain sample of arms then all processes will happen very quickly" </strong></h3>
<p>The accelerator team states that all stages of the above processes are now on -automated and transparent, easily track the course of documents or at what stage the process has slowed down.</p>
<p>The complete implementation of the concept of the "single window" created by the accelerator will make the revolution in the processes of prompt implementation of new OVT samples for our Army.</p>
<ul>
<li>If at least one of the commands of the Armed Forces is interested in a certain model of weapons of a certain enterprise, then all processes will happen very quickly. Handy, we have enough "horizontal" country, and everyone knows each other, communicate. As a rule, those who have already tested some pilot projects on our doors on our doors. Therefore, as a result, all this also gives an opportunity. For if something goes to us(New development. - Ed.), then we immediately send it to commands. And, as a rule, they reagate quite quickly, - said the initiative coordinator to create acceleratoramic enopens Sergey Loboyko.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sergei adds that with the help of an accelerator the Ministry of Defense plans to attract specialists in his team:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will declare a call for anyone who has serious experience in the management of projects, who has serious analytical competencies, perhaps communication competences. We will urge such specialists to submit a resume. If it is a mobilized carrier, then we will consider the possibility of transferring it to our commission. We also consider civilian experts as candidates for cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be reported that the accelerator of innovative development of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is establishing cooperation with the accelerator of defensive innovations as of the North Atlantic(DIANA).</p>
<p>The Ukrainian team also communicates with the British accelerator(DASA).–í–µ–¥—É—Ç—å—Å—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∏ –∑ –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü—ñ—î—é —Ç–∞ —Å–∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω–∞–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞–º–∏. –ü–ª–∞–Ω—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—Å–ø—ñ–≤–ø—Ä–∞—Ü—è –∑ –∞–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∫–æ–ª–µ–≥–∞–º–∏.</p>

<p>About it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/russias-heinous-and-desperate-actions-demonstrate-that-it-knows-the-invasion-has-failed-uk-statement-to-the-osce">stated</a>The UK representative in the OSCE, military advisor Stabbs.</p>
<p>According to him, the intellectually bankrupt address of the Kremlin to the grueling war testifies to his horrific willingness to sacrifice the Russian people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe long attempts by Russia to break the will and determination of the Ukrainian people with repeated ropes and attacks of drones in cities and settlements throughout Ukraine with pathetic and disgusting actions. These are desperate actions of Russian warlords who have exhausted ideas that constantly overestimate their strength and underestimate the power and determination of the Ukrainian people, ‚ÄùJan Stabbs stressed.</p>
<p>He added that at the beginning of a large-scale offensive of Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 20122, one of the goals was the full capture of the entire Donbass region for 10-14 days. However, after 15 months, the offensive of Russia in eastern Ukraine stopped the value of extremely high losses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor more than a year, we have observed how those who make decisions double their other unhappy plan in case of unforeseen circumstances - a meaningless, intellectually bankrupt appeal to a grueling war. This has led to the Kremlin's readiness to sacrifice the Russian people, including his mobilized citizens, thousands in the name of Putin's terrible and super -fetched. Our Russian colleague insists that such a "military special operation" is being conducted that all goals will be achieved. We all know that the war chosen by Putin in Ukraine is built on a lie, but a reality: a slowdrolling invasion of Russia, thousands of losses of Russians and significant deterioration of Russia's capacity clearly demonstrate that this is not true at all, ‚ÄùJanstabbs said.</p>

<p>He just had a bet. The situation on the forefront is the main attention. Reports - teams of operational directions, head, GUR, Ministry of Defense, Minds Strategy, Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Attention is focused on all areas where our actions are needed and where the enemy can be disassembled. Our defensive actions, active actions, our achievements of the front.</p>
<p>They discussed the supply and distribution of ammunition, strengthening of our artillery and air defense.</p>
<p>He spoke today with Japan and the Netherlands. I informed the rescue operation in the southern areas, about our urgent needs. The readiness to help Ukraine is, and I am grateful to partners. There are decisions on humanitarian support.</p>
<p>With Mr. Prime Minister of Japan, they discussed the preparation of the Global Peace Summit Conference in Japan on the reconstruction and transformation of our country of post-fighting.</p>
<p>With Mr. Prime Minister of the Netherlands, we talked about our further defense work, coordinated our positions in front of the next Ramstein. We move by step in strengthening our air shield. They discussed the Petriots coalition, our pilots training.</p>
<p>There is a very important decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the Scythian Gold Collection. Ukrainian collection. Collections stored in our Krym, but which cannot yet be returned to the Crimea for an obvious reason: it can be given to the occupier, a robber.</p>
<p>Of course, it will be in Crimea, when there will be a Ukrainian flag in the Crimea. Actually, such logic was confirmed by the Higher Judiciary of the Netherlands. And this is the alternatives that the Dutch, people, the Dutch society and the state can be the leaders in protecting the rule of law and values of civilization.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who fought for this decision, our team of ministry, who worked for the sake of this result. Justice - step by step - will protect.</p>
<p>There is also a new defense package from the United States for more than $ 2 million. Petriots rockets and other air defense systems, strengthening our defense on Earth, increasing the strength of all our soldiers. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you both parties of Congress and all Americans who want freedom won as well as Ukrainians.A tremendous number of problems. But we work on overcoming them at all possible levels. And most importantly, there is now social potential to do so.</p>
<p>Take care of each other, work in unity, protect people and life. These are our print, the principles of Ukraine. They now act on one hundred percent prices. And I am sure that it would be difficult, we will overcome the consequences of this catastrophe, and all Russian evil.</p>
<p>I thank everyone in the world who already helps and who asks in Ukraine how to help. I thank everyone who is already involved in the rescue operation, who as possible helps people. People, animals, all living things. I thank all who are inducting international organizations, foreign leaders, other states to see what happened, and to name things by their names. Russian terrorists should be in accordance with what they had done.</p>
<p>And separately - for our soldiers, for all who these days are in particularly heavy battles.</p>
<p>We see your heroism, and we are grateful to you for every minute of your life - life is really a life of Ukraine. Because Ukraine is as free as you, our own, are strong. Ukraine is so protected as you, our warriors, are effective.</p>
<p>Everyone and everyone who is fighting is Ukraine that is fighting. Thank you for it!Glory to everyone who is fighting and working for our country!</p>
