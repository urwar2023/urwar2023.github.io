 Agrarians of coal regions of Ukraine will change the structure of crops, reoriented to other branches of agriculture due to lack of release due to the blasting of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station by the Russians.
This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the All -Ukrainian Agrarian Council Denis Marchuk during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.
"The South for us has always traditionally grown such oil cultures as a media, rapeseed, soybean, because there was a lot of sunshine even watering - Ideal conditions to collect much more than in other territories of Ukraine. I think that after the de -occupation of agricultural producers will look for crop rotation and any international technologies, "he said.
Marchuk noted that Ukrainian agrarians can take over US experience, which in some states also work in a similar number.
The expert stressed that agriculture in the southern regions of the country will not stop even in the absence of irrigation. According to Marchuk, all the lands that are in this region use melioration. For example, about 300 thousand hectares of land irrigates in Kherson region, and the acreage is almost 1 million hectares.
"In the conditions without water, it is very difficult to talk about profitability, so those who will turn and want to engage in agriculture will probably simply increase the number of crops. What will give birth, then will give birth," - said Var.
In his opinion, the problem of lack of irrigation can be solved by the use of the use of well technology. Marchuk explained that it will be able to use those entrepreneurs whose business is located near the water, so these will be the case.
The expert noted that the agricultural business in the southern regions will have to support the Ukrainian state at the expense of special programs and subsidies. The most opinion, agricultural producers in the region will be able to reorient the business business, in particular, to engage in greenhouse farms.

 Ukraine is amazing for the algorithm of joining NATO at the Vilnius Summit of the Alliance.
The document will not provide for additional requirements for the Ukrainian side, said the deputy head of the Presidential Office Igor Zhovkva in an interview Ukrinform .
“Before the end of the war, before our victory, we will not complete this entry process(Incidentally - order.). Але це не забороняє державам-членам прийняти політичне рішення уВільнюсі про початок процесу. Нам не потрібен жоден План дій щодо членства. Мийого потребували в 2008 році, коли держави-члени НАТО зробили велику помилку,сказавши «А», не сказали «Б». Тепер просто посилання на рішення Бухарестськогосаміту для нас є застарілим, так само як не треба в десятий чи сотий разговорити про «відкриті двері», - зазначив він.
За його словами, алгоритм вступу, на прийнятті якого наполягає українськасторона, не може містити жодних додаткових вимог до України.
Жовква пояснив, що у Північноатлантичному договорі визначено два критерії, заякими країна може стати членом Альянсу. Так, за його словами, першим критеріємє поділ євроатлантичних цінностей, а більше 90% українців підтримують вступ доНАТО, другим – внесок у безпеку євроатлантичного простору.

The deputy head of the OP added that mutually transfers with NATO states on the battlefield, mastering the most modern equipment sometimes better than the Alliance's army member states, according to the Pentagon and other relevant identity.
Zhovkva expects that such an algorithm will be given in Vilnius to Ukraine.
"Otherwise, this will send another very strong but negative signal from the members of the aggressor country: you see, more than a year of war, a year of the aftermaddride summit, and there is no answer to Ukraine," he added."In the decision of the Madrid summit, there was a line:" Invite Finland and Sweden to NATO "and further, after the point:" To date, the household, the security of Sweden and Finland is important for all Member States. " This is not Article 5. We do not require Article 5 until the moment of membership. The best guarantee of our security is NATO membership. However, by the time, clear security security guarantees must be assigned to a multilateral document on paper, in parallel with bilateral agreements, ” - said.
According to him, it should be a multilateral framework document such as the Yermak-Rusmussen Group, which will be the basis, and then they can "string" bilateral security agreements. states.
"However, the summit needs to adopt such a framework multilateral document with NATO countries that will express your desire," Zhovkva emphasized.
He explained that guarantees are those actions that are already carried out in relation to Ukraine, including through the provision of weapons, macro -financial assistance, preservation and strengthening of sanctions against Russia, but they must be clear and systematic.

At the same time, the question whether many countries spoke guarantees, and the nurture: “Many. We work with four: US, UK, Germany, France. Some other countries do not mind joining. But we will not open the picture. "

 The destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam in Ukraine emphasizes a significant gap in international criminal law.
This opinion was expressed in an exclusive comment to the correspondent of Ukrinform VGAAAZ executive director of the international organization Stop Ecocide International, also known as SEI, Jioje Menht.
“The destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam in Ukraine is catastrophic and emphasizes a significant prologue in international criminal law. It is time for, finally, to recognize the ecocid - a serious and large -scale or long -term environmental harm to the environment - an independent crime both in peacetime and during the conflict, ”she said.
It is worth noting that the international organization Stop Ecocide International seek to identify ecocide international crime. He emphasizes that ecocide is a serious damage to the environment or ecosystem, which threatens living things and can even lead to complete destruction of the long -lived environment. The organization wants to involve lawyers, experts, diplomats and all sectors of civil society to work so that the ecocide is recognized as an international crime.

According to her, according to Art. 441 of the Criminal Code, Ecocide - the mass destruction of the flora of the workpiece, poisoning of the atmosphere or water resources, as well as more actions that can cause environmental catastrophe - is punishable by deprivation for a term of eight to fifteen years.

According to her, to talk about the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, more information is needed directly from the place. But referring to Olenukravchenko, who is the executive director, the board of the Board of the Organization "Ecology-Right-human"(Apple), Mehta noted that "this" ecocide "threatens" unprecedented ecological consequences. "
In particular, it is about garbage contamination, dangerous chemicals, mass death of fish, shellfish and other aquatic species.
“The use of the term“ ecocide ”is important because very often the environmental damage caused during armed conflicts is not given due attention. It is clear that both the media and the legal authorities are often focused on the direct harm to people, the harm of infrastructure, etc. many years or decades after the conflict is completed. Therefore, the name of the environmental harm of ecocide reflects this seriousness and means that it is perceived as seriously as it should be, ” - said themechta.

"First of all, the destruction of the Kakhovsky Dam indicates that the time has come to an international level of ecocide to solve the most serious cases of ecological destruction, where and if they would not be unacceptable," Mehta stressed.

This is stated in the message of the organization Greenpeace transmitted by Ukrinform.
“The long-term occupation of the ZPPC is jeopardizing nuclear safety with any emergency intervention, if a crisis is caused by damage to the Dambielectrostation. Such damage can be both inadant, due to increased water pressure and the consequence of criminal acting on the part of Russian troops. The Russian occupation should be immediately attracted, and Ukrainian control over the station is restored, ” - said UGRENEENPEACE.

As it is noted, the greatest concern is the fact that the cooler of Nazaposhzhzhza nuclear power plant is under threat of the leakage of a hypotentive collapse, if the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir is drawn. The Ukrainian authorities said it was expected to fall up to 3 meters of the week from 17.4 meters, as it was before the destruction of the Kakhovska Damba as a result of Russia's actions. Such a fall in water levels increases the pressure water On the walls of the dam- the pond- cooler electricity.

The war is not without loss. The worst but inevitable losses are humans. And unfortunately, they have not yet created military equipment that cannot be destroyed. And current wars are giving in two dimensions - real and informational.
This noted Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in Telegrams.
“In the information fight are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, the rules of Izacon, ”she said.
For example, any side of the armed conflict seeks to show the loss of the opponent and classes its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Because the more information about the enemy is opened, the easier it is to calculate his or her disability and plans.
“In addition to intelligence, and the Russians are now very complicated in our territory, there are shrubs to extract the necessary information through throwing in infostirproproups. In this way, you can make the other side give as much information about yourself as possible. For example, because of the incentive to justify the tricks, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.
To do this, as Anna Malyar summarizes, very high numbers in the hope that the Ukrainians will be indignant will begin to refute and issue any data or indirect orientation on them.
“For example, information about the disappearance of the Glavcom or other commander- in anticipation of comments and denials of demonstration on photo-tavideolocations- where they really are. Therefore, it should be understood that we are fighting information, like the enemy, ”said Anna Malyar.

Patrushev also stated that "the peoples of Ukraine and Russia are not interested in the conflict."
The power of the terrorist country continues to exist in parallel reality and to submit a narrative, as if Ukrainians and Russians-"brotherly peoples" who want to be in peace.

Immediately after the illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia launched a campaign from deprivation of Ukraine's national cultural heritage, initiated with the help of substantive "Crimean museums" the trial in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The aggressor country demanded to transfer to the peninsula a collection of so-called Scythian gold, which had previously been at the exhibition at the Alesterdam Museum of Allard Pearson.
For almost nine years, the legal struggle in the courts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has lasted. Russia did not spare resources during attempts to illegally appropriation of Ukraine's cultural values. But all the courts of the Netherlands rejected any "Crimean museums" on the "Scythian gold" and made the decision of the Russian.
Ukraine expresses gratitude to the kingdom of the Netherlands for ensuring unbiased objective justice and for steady support for the international justice.

 The nasty and desperate actions of Russia show that it recognizes failure to Ukraine.
About it stated The UK representative in the OSCE, military advisor Stabbs.
According to him, the intellectually bankrupt address of the Kremlin to the grueling war testifies to his horrific willingness to sacrifice the Russian people.
“The long attempts by Russia to break the will and determination of the Ukrainian people with repeated ropes and attacks of drones in cities and settlements throughout Ukraine with pathetic and disgusting actions. These are desperate actions of Russian warlords who have exhausted ideas that constantly overestimate their strength and underestimate the power and determination of the Ukrainian people, ”Jan Stabbs stressed.
He added that at the beginning of a large-scale offensive of Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 20122, one of the goals was the full capture of the entire Donbass region for 10-14 days. However, after 15 months, the offensive of Russia in eastern Ukraine stopped the value of extremely high losses.
“For more than a year, we have observed how those who make decisions double their other unhappy plan in case of unforeseen circumstances - a meaningless, intellectually bankrupt appeal to a grueling war. This has led to the Kremlin's readiness to sacrifice the Russian people, including his mobilized citizens, thousands in the name of Putin's terrible and super -fetched. Our Russian colleague insists that such a "military special operation" is being conducted that all goals will be achieved. We all know that the war chosen by Putin in Ukraine is built on a lie, but a reality: a slowdrolling invasion of Russia, thousands of losses of Russians and significant deterioration of Russia's capacity clearly demonstrate that this is not true at all, ”Janstabbs said.
