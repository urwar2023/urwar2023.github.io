President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the third meeting of the round table World Bank on Ukraine's support.
_Text of the speech: _
_ President Malass, thank you for your support. Ms. Director-Managor Crystalina, Mr. Vice president Dombrovskis ._ 
_ ladies and gentlemen ministers, secretaries, heads of international financial institutions… _ 
Thank you all for this meeting, for your work in this format.
Now Ukraine is experiencing special emotions. Yesterday, Russian sources were widespread on the Internet video of the animal murder of our soldier by the occupiers.
They, in the video, boast about their ability to kill. Apparently, you have all seen what is being said. And you know that this level of violence, this level of destruction, the Russian army tries to make a routine everywhere on Ukrainian lands.
You cannot get used to it. Every time shock as they first do something.
The death of Russia should not become a routine!The long history of Russian freeness should finally stop.
I thank everyone in the world, thank everyone and every one of you who helps Ukrainian to play!But every day ... Every day we lose our people - men and women, adults and children who die from Russian hands ...
I ask you now to pay a moment of silence to the memory of this Ukrainian, whose death saw yesterday, and the memory of all our people whose lives were worn by Russian invasion.
Thank you. This is very important for all of us.
 _ Dear present!_ 
Ukraine will win this war. Only the question of the time when Russian aggression is illuminated.
But the state-zla should not remain a chance to defeat the ruins.
What is the purpose of the terrorist always? To break life. If you do not kill, then cripple. If it is destroyed, then make it suffer.
Any aggressor that hates life-whether it acts at the state level, Yakovia, whether at the level of terrorist group, or at the level of one degraded personality ... The aggressor always enjoys when it destroys. And when the ruins of after aggression have to overcome for decades.Supporting rapid recovery is literally part of the anti -terrorist work. Cleaning what has been destroyed, we win the main target - we return a normal life.
The second point is assets of the state.
For the first time in history, the world has such a large -scale opportunity to harvest losses from an uncontrollable and illegal war on the aggressor - to be guilty of war.
For example, the World Bank has given a new estimate of the losses and needs of Ukraine with a volume of $ 411 million. Every day Russia increases this account. The world has Russian jacobes of different species that cover this level of losses!
Potential aggressors in the world are now looking at whether you are doing the right one. Conflicting Russian assets, as well as assets of persons related to the governing building of the state, real. Confiscate and direct that the life of in Ukraine could recover. Russia should feel the full price of its aggression.
 Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Ukraine appeals to you with two calls. The first: priority needs.
I thank you for the new IMF cooperation program, which is a significant stabilization process for Ukraine. This will help us to fight. But in order for people to turn to Ukraine so that the aggressor will lose not only on the battlefield, but literally, we need the approval of the support program to cover the first -time prosets of rapid recovery. The total volume of such projects is $ 14.1 billion. Our government officials, who are now in Washington, are presenting.
And second. It is already necessary to work on specific mechanisms of directing the frozen Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by Russia. Treachitko declare that assets, including the assets of the Russian Central Bank, will be confiscated. It will be the peacekeeping act - an inflammatory scale. Potential aggressors should see it. And remember that the world can be strong.
There may be different formats of decisions, but the faster and more effective decisions will be, the more to the more will be peace after this war.
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
There are no minor fronts in the war. Everyone needs attention and strength. Financial front - especially. We do our part of the work and I am grateful to everyone who helps. But fundamental solutions depend on you.
I believe they will be approved!
Thank you for your attention!Glory to all who are now in battle for life and freedom for our people!
Glory to Ukraine!

The enemy exports documentation from pension funds on temporarily occupied territories(THAT).
Про це повідомляє The Center for National Resistance to Special Forces.
“In particular, from Donetsk to the Russian Federation, pension affairs are taken from all major populated points that are temporarily captured by the enemy. At the same time, Moscow set the task to take all the cases by August.
At the same time, this is presented, as if because of the technical inability to process the information on the Tot, as well as to "facilitate the evacuation of" retirement age ", - the message reads.
The National Resistance Center reminds that since March 1, the payment of pensions for Tott is available in the presence of an enemy passport. At the same time, the certification in the region is slow, and a large number of population ignores the receipt of the passport.

 Under the cover of the conscription in the Russian Federation is gaining momentum. In addition, unlike the first part of partial mobilization, even Moscow and St. Petersburg joined the necessary indicators, in addition to depressive regions of the Russian Federation.
On March 30, Putin signed a decree on the six -year spring conscription military service from April 1 to July 15, during which 147,000 Russians between the ages of 18 and 27 will be drafted. Russia conducts two cylm a year, during the spring call is usually called 134 thousand Russians. At the same time, according to British intelligence, the Russian authorities are preparing to develop a large campaign for a set of additional 400 thousand servicemen.
And in order for the Russians to be left with a chance to avoid conscription, the State Duma would accept a series of laws on the creation of a Unified Register of Military Treatment of Electronic Tales on April 11.
The adopted package of laws is as rigid as possible and actually introduces the preinterrestation of guilt. It equates electronic reports to paper and a closing visit abroad to citizens who will fall into the register. The introduced electronic statement will be considered as prescribed from the moment of placement in the personal office of the state service "State Services"(The only platform of public and municipal services of the Russian Federation).Тобто чоловік може не знати, що йому виписана повістка, але через 7 днів післяїї формування він автоматично стає злочинцем. Нові правила торкнуться якстроковиків, так і всіх військовозобов’язаних, а за їх ігнорування ухилянтамзагрожує низка покарань. Серед обмежень: заборона на реєстраціюіндивідуального підприємця, на державну реєстрацію транспортних засобів,водіння, відмова в укладенні кредитного договору та договору позики.
Звичні схеми ухилення за такого механізму неможливі, як неможливо і легальнозмінити військову службу на альтернативну, тобто росіян поставили у безвихідь,якої не було з часів радянського союзу.
Характерно, що влада продовжує наполягати, що нововведення не пов’язані змобілізацією, а лише поліпшують процедуру вручення повісток і військовогообліку, а проведення мобілізації зараз в країні нібито не планується.
До чого може призвести новий призов і чи посилить він військовий потенціал зсрф?
Secondly, Putin is unlikely to decide to use the recently called troops in Ukraine. In addition, the chairman of the State Duma Committee of Rfartpolov emphasized that during the spring conscript cycle of 2023, the prisoners will not go to Ukraine. Against the backdrop of social tension of tamas protest shares due to the departure to the front of recruits, the winter and spring prison of 2022, it is doubtful that Putin will risk repeating a mistake due to the stability of his regime.
Third, the use of innovations will predict a sharp burst and provokes a new wave of emigration and other methods of boycotters. The Levada survey shows an increase in the "request for peace" in Russian society. If in the first months for the "war before victory" and for "peaceful interpretations" was expressed an equal number of citizens(approximately 44%), then after the first wave of mobilization - already 60% for peace, and only a third - for the continuation. In the Russian segment of the Steam Game Platform, even the viral distribution of the computer game "Simulator Escape from the military enlistment office", the character of which the youth Russian is doing everything to avoid the call.
Therefore, conducting hidden mobilization under the guise of "Putin's call" of Taurus of digital authoritarian tools will not help the Kremlin achieved goals in Ukraine and consolidate power within Russia.

 The same "Neptune" rockets of Ukrainian missiles were affected by the same "Russian ship" - the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Moscow missile cruiser, which drown the next day.
Mood of annual antiquity remembered Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov.
“The event was so inspiring and incredible at the same time that many seemed to be true. After all, Russia has lost its flagship of overpayment ago, ”he said.
Our warriors, according to Alexei Reznikov, made it seemingly impossible. It changed the course of history. Because the chain reaction began. It was the last day of the Russian fleet on the Black Sea.
" first , the successful use of Ukrainian missiles at such a distance has convinced partners that there is no point in delaying the transfer of Harpoon missiles.
*!As a result, this led to the escape invaders from the island of Snake, which they called "a gesture of goodwill."
Third , the release of the snake made it possible to open a "grain corridor". Our products were worldly supported, Ukraine has received resources for defense. If it was not possible to make Moscow, it would be impossible to achieve this result.
As a result, the Russian fleet is forced to hide south and east of the Crimea. Kremliv's dreams of landing in Odessa remained in the past. Now the Russians can be cowardly firing civilians from the air, ” - said the Glava of the Defense Office of Ukraine.
Alexei Reznikov summed up: the main conclusion from this story is our country and to decide how to protect it. Even if someone still cares about Kreml's face.
“It is proven in combat that Made in Ukraine weapons are able to cope with more acquired tasks and protect on level with the best partner development. The development of the Ukrainian MIC is a priority because it is an element of our respectiveness.
Our success on the battlefield is the key to what they will support us, ” - he is convinced.
So now the most important thing, as the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine noted, is to support our defenders and defenders, to maintain unity, step by step to the goal. Victory is inevitable.

 Ukraine should take advantage of the opportunities of international courts, because for the first time Russia is not the first time the Ukrainian nation is destroyed. It is also important that the Russian Federation is international criminal liability for the omnipotence that it commits in our territory.
About it during briefing The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said VMILITARY Media Center.
The charter provides for four crimes that are subject to the jurisdiction of the international court: war crimes, crimes against humanity, aggression and genocide.
“But the first and key crime is aggression. All other crimes are derivatives of depression. And the world must, on the example of the Russo-Ukrainian War, realize that all the instruments that were created before this to counteract such wars are not working, ”said Anna Malyar.
She recalled that since the Nuremberg process in the world, no sentence for aggression, where wars are constantly being constantly, have been announced.
“Therefore, the Russian-Ukrainian war should become the point from which the political will to punish aggressors in the world for such difficult, internationalist, in particular for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. And it is a one tool for all other aggressors that may have the same immibitions as Putin. If he and Russia are not punished, then it will solve it to all others, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.

-In addition to the "new" relay, the servicemen of the center found in the UAV Shahd 136 so-called GSM transverse. The main feature of this device is to accept and transmit information by the 3G, 4G GSM-standard channels. As it turned out, there is nothing Russian in it - no chip or chip. Even there are no Russian markings. There is also no traditional "brand" equipment for such equipment. Hence the conclusion that such a device was prepared and installed quickly. Although the marking of the central microprocessor is completely destroyed, and therefore not established origin. However, we can state that it is not Russian production, - says Andrei Rudyk.
-You can see some foreign components in Zala 421-16e. This processor, RAM, Internet Commercial and Audio Codek of Field Controller, Global Navigation Satellite Satellite Receiver, Air Value Sensor, Barometric High meter of Inertocial Navigation System, etc. It is worth noting that each of these components is not new. It is possible that they were used somewhere, before getting into this drone.The words of the speaker, found in both modifications, are evidenced by the prodigal facts. First of all, the Russian MIC is in principle not capable of providing a full cycle of production of own and maintenance of UAVs. Not only the basic components, but even the latest "modifications" are of foreign origin. It is obvious that the Russian MIC in the production of bplassically dependent on foreign components.

Sociologists claim that UOC -MP support has decreased with 15%(to a large -scale invasion)Do4%(As of April 2022), - he said.
According to him, at the same time in Ukraine significantly increased supporters of the idea of connection of the UOC -MP with the Moscow Patriarchate. Thus, in March 2022 it was supported by 63% of respondents, and in April this year-already 74%(Sociological Research of the Rating Group).
