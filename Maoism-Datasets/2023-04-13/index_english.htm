<p>It was very emotionally and honorable to me today to congratulate our young police and rescuers of the SES with completion of study. More than 3 thousand youth - professional and patriotic - are now joining those who want to protect the safety and normality of life. They will also work in the Quaregions, where it is most dangerous. The distribution will be served in frontlines, in the border - in Kharkiv, Sumy region. There are those who will fight the new assault teams.I believe that today's graduates of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are justifying human hopes.</p>
<p>By the way, I would like to celebrate such defenders now - such rescuers, in particular from Nikopol. SES of Major Artem Shuldyakova, Lieutenant Fyodor Zaykina, Senior Sergeant Vasyl Muzychenko, Junior Satistant Vitaliy Bulkin. Thank you guys for the rescue of the Ukrainians of post -Russian rocket strokes!</p>
<p>I will also note the police crews - "White Angels" who save our people in the home, evacuate, send humanitarian aid, resuscitated ...</p>
<p>I thank the police Gennady Yudin from Avdiivka for the salvation of children, Paramedic Popi, one of the White Angels in the Mariinsky Front. They have already rescued hundreds of our people, including seriously wounded.</p>
<p>I also thank today especially the explosion of the National Police Vladimir Perepelytsya, who works for mine in Kherson region, works very effectively.</p>
<p>And one more.</p>
<p>Today in our country traditionally celebrates the Day of employees of the rocket and space industry. The industry that always made glory to Ukraine. And I'm sure he will do!</p>
<p>Thank you all who have retained our potential. Our current level of integration is international relations, our level of power - both the state and society - for which Ukraine deserves, the level of our people - all this will allow Ukraine to take in the development of outer space along with the advanced states, and our business - along with advanced companies.</p>
<p>But first - we will win!In particular, thanks to Ukrainian rockets.</p>

<p>According to him, the PCU did not allow the PCA to continue to make a sebellist or participant in the party struggle.</p>
<p>“For years, the structure of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine has been built by a false model of shadow control. Derkach, Novinsky, Medvedchuk and other -like figures considered themselves as participants of the "joint -stock company", which were releasing behind the back of "hired managers" in the ranks all key issues. It has largely led to the current public catastrofiomoskovsky Patriarchate in Ukraine, ”the PCU Primate.</p>

<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the third meeting of the round table <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/uk/country/ukraine">World Bank</a>on Ukraine's support.</p>
<p>_Text of the speech: _</p>
<p><strong> _ President Malass, thank you for your support. Ms. Director-Managor Crystalina, Mr. Vice president Dombrovskis ._ </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ ladies and gentlemen ministers, secretaries, heads of international financial institutions… _ </strong></p>
<p>Thank you all for this meeting, for your work in this format.</p>
<p>Now Ukraine is experiencing special emotions. Yesterday, Russian sources were widespread on the Internet video of the animal murder of our soldier by the occupiers.</p>
<p>They, in the video, boast about their ability to kill. Apparently, you have all seen what is being said. And you know that this level of violence, this level of destruction, the Russian army tries to make a routine everywhere on Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>You cannot get used to it. Every time shock as they first do something.</p>
<p>The death of Russia should not become a routine!The long history of Russian freeness should finally stop.</p>
<p>I thank everyone in the world, thank everyone and every one of you who helps Ukrainian to play!But every day ... Every day we lose our people - men and women, adults and children who die from Russian hands ...</p>
<p>I ask you now to pay a moment of silence to the memory of this Ukrainian, whose death saw yesterday, and the memory of all our people whose lives were worn by Russian invasion.</p>
<p>Thank you. This is very important for all of us.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T01-00-00-04-00/12-4.jpg" /><strong> _ Dear present!_ </strong></p>
<p>Ukraine will win this war. Only the question of the time when Russian aggression is illuminated.</p>
<p>But the state-zla should not remain a chance to defeat the ruins.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the terrorist always? To break life. If you do not kill, then cripple. If it is destroyed, then make it suffer.</p>
<p>Any aggressor that hates life-whether it acts at the state level, Yakovia, whether at the level of terrorist group, or at the level of one degraded personality ... The aggressor always enjoys when it destroys. And when the ruins of after aggression have to overcome for decades.Supporting rapid recovery is literally part of the anti -terrorist work. Cleaning what has been destroyed, we win the main target - we return a normal life.</p>
<p>The second point is assets of the state.</p>
<p>For the first time in history, the world has such a large -scale opportunity to harvest losses from an uncontrollable and illegal war on the aggressor - to be guilty of war.</p>
<p>For example, the World Bank has given a new estimate of the losses and needs of Ukraine with a volume of $ 411 million. Every day Russia increases this account. The world has Russian jacobes of different species that cover this level of losses!</p>
<p>Potential aggressors in the world are now looking at whether you are doing the right one. Conflicting Russian assets, as well as assets of persons related to the governing building of the state, real. Confiscate and direct that the life of in Ukraine could recover. Russia should feel the full price of its aggression.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T01-00-00-04-00/13-4.jpg" /><strong><em>Ladies and Gentlemen!</em></strong></p>
<p>Ukraine appeals to you with two calls. The first: priority needs.</p>
<p>I thank you for the new IMF cooperation program, which is a significant stabilization process for Ukraine. This will help us to fight. But in order for people to turn to Ukraine so that the aggressor will lose not only on the battlefield, but literally, we need the approval of the support program to cover the first -time prosets of rapid recovery. The total volume of such projects is $ 14.1 billion. Our government officials, who are now in Washington, are presenting.</p>
<p>And second. It is already necessary to work on specific mechanisms of directing the frozen Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by Russia. Treachitko declare that assets, including the assets of the Russian Central Bank, will be confiscated. It will be the peacekeeping act - an inflammatory scale. Potential aggressors should see it. And remember that the world can be strong.</p>
<p>There may be different formats of decisions, but the faster and more effective decisions will be, the more to the more will be peace after this war.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ladies and Gentlemen!</em></strong></p>
<p>There are no minor fronts in the war. Everyone needs attention and strength. Financial front - especially. We do our part of the work and I am grateful to everyone who helps. But fundamental solutions depend on you.</p>
<p>I believe they will be approved!</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention!Glory to all who are now in battle for life and freedom for our people!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

<p>The National Resistance Center reminds that since March 1, the payment of pensions for Tott is available in the presence of an enemy passport. At the same time, the certification in the region is slow, and a large number of population ignores the receipt of the passport.</p>

In addition, unlike the first part of partial mobilization, even Moscow and St. Petersburg joined the necessary indicators, in addition to depressive regions of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>On March 30, Putin signed a decree on the six -year spring conscription military service from April 1 to July 15, during which 147,000 Russians between the ages of 18 and 27 will be drafted. Russia conducts two cylm a year, during the spring call is usually called 134 thousand Russians. At the same time, according to British intelligence, the Russian authorities are preparing to develop a large campaign for a set of additional 400 thousand servicemen.</p>
<p>And in order for the Russians to be left with a chance to avoid conscription, the State Duma would accept a series of laws on the creation of a Unified Register of Military Treatment of Electronic Tales on April 11.</p>
<p>The adopted package of laws is as rigid as possible and actually introduces the preinterrestation of guilt. It equates electronic reports to paper and a closing visit abroad to citizens who will fall into the register. The introduced electronic statement will be considered as prescribed from the moment of placement in the personal office of the state service "State Services"(The only platform of public and municipal services of the Russian Federation).Тобто чоловік може не знати, що йому виписана повістка, але через 7 днів післяїї формування він автоматично стає злочинцем. Нові правила торкнуться якстроковиків, так і всіх військовозобов’язаних, а за їх ігнорування ухилянтамзагрожує низка покарань. Серед обмежень: заборона на реєстраціюіндивідуального підприємця, на державну реєстрацію транспортних засобів,водіння, відмова в укладенні кредитного договору та договору позики.</p>
<p>Звичні схеми ухилення за такого механізму неможливі, як неможливо і легальнозмінити військову службу на альтернативну, тобто росіян поставили у безвихідь,якої не було з часів радянського союзу.</p>
<p>Характерно, що влада продовжує наполягати, що нововведення не пов’язані змобілізацією, а лише поліпшують процедуру вручення повісток і військовогообліку, а проведення мобілізації зараз в країні нібито не планується.</p>
<p>До чого може призвести новий призов і чи посилить він військовий потенціал зсрф?</p>
<p>Secondly, Putin is unlikely to decide to use the recently called troops in Ukraine. In addition, the chairman of the State Duma Committee of Rfartpolov emphasized that during the spring conscript cycle of 2023, the prisoners will not go to Ukraine. Against the backdrop of social tension of tamas protest shares due to the departure to the front of recruits, the winter and spring prison of 2022, it is doubtful that Putin will risk repeating a mistake due to the stability of his regime.</p>
<p>Third, the use of innovations will predict a sharp burst and provokes a new wave of emigration and other methods of boycotters. The Levada survey shows an increase in the "request for peace" in Russian society. If in the first months for the "war before victory" and for "peaceful interpretations" was expressed an equal number of citizens(approximately 44%), then after the first wave of mobilization - already 60% for peace, and only a third - for the continuation. In the Russian segment of the Steam Game Platform, even the viral distribution of the computer game "Simulator Escape from the military enlistment office", the character of which the youth Russian is doing everything to avoid the call.</p>
<p>Therefore, conducting hidden mobilization under the guise of "Putin's call" of Taurus of digital authoritarian tools will not help the Kremlin achieved goals in Ukraine and consolidate power within Russia.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports with reference to <a href="https://ugcc.ua/data/glava-ugkts-pro-podiy-navkolo-kyevo-pecherskoy-lavry-nam-bolyache-za-tsym-sposterigaty-2532/"></a>The head of the UGCC announced his position in an interview with Maria Radio.</p>
<p>“It is very painful for us to watch everything around the Lavra. There are several reasons for this. First, it is very painful to look at the shameful behavior of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which sometimes resembles the behavior of the oligarchs. And this is a certain challenge for public morality, ”the head said.</p>
<p>"I do not want to condemn anyone, but it beats everyone, causes the moral loss of the church as such," said His Beatitude Sviatoslav.</p>
<p>It is also unfortunate that the Ukrainian state has disordered its relations as the owner of this national historical reserve with tenants for over 30 years.</p>

The one for whom the law was unwritten, as for many oligarchs, feels insulting when he is forced to comply with this law, ”the bishop said.</p>
<p>His Beatitude Svyatoslav noted that sometimes the state lacks a clear policy while <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-upc-mp"></a>. “And in order to be truly seeing the light around this great pain and scandal, you need to adhere to the law to both parties. We will be very careful about the actions, because today they are not fully understood, in particular the international community, ”the UGCC head said.The head of the UGCC also told about other pain on this. “Today, we can ever hear that there is a danger with water to splash the baby. Such a title of Lavra forms a very radical attitude towards church spiritual life in general ... We have heard a statement by Metropolitan Epiphany with a negative evaluation The scandalous behavior of the clergy, trying to eliminate the public discourse, discredit any church religious life, ”he said.</p>

Here the state is punished by collaborators and traitors. But we understand that if any church loses trust, it can cause powerful wavesecularization. That is why it hurts me, ”the UGCC head said.</p>
<p>“Still, I believe in the wisdom of the Ukrainian people. I believe that we are a Christian, believing people, and that our spiritual criteria of evaluations of dramatic situations will help to find the right solution to even those problems that have not been solved for a while and have intensified now, during the war, ”Svyatoslav summed up.</p>

<p>This was stated by Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar on the broadcasting of the only news, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"Options why this video appeared now can be different. The first is what maybe they want to intimidate us, although it is very difficult to imagine what we can do we have passed after we have passed this year. The second is Perhaps the struggle within the Russian power elites. Now there is an assumption that representatives of the unit could do it. Perhaps this is the same and there is an internal -proof in the Russian Federation.</p>

One of them, she said, is the report of the unit that the task was completed, and the second option is the people who implemented it, apparently, did not do it for the first time some pleasure and self -affirmation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the painter noted that it is very good that these crimes did not remain heated, because if it were not for this video, we would not have been learned with very likely and the guilty would not be punished.</p>
<p>"Thanks to this video there is an international level to condemn the people who have done this. It is very important how the world evaluates it. It is about aggression, crimes against humanity and genocide of the Ukrainian people. .</p>

We have seen recently the execution of the Ukrainian bark for the slogan "Glory to Ukraine!" And in general, every few weeks-months, similar content appears. It is a purposeful state policy of the Russian Federation of highlighting the atrocities of their army against the Ukrainian military. The goal is to try to admitize and sow panic in the Ukrainian defense forces that they are not faded, ”Andrei Yusov explained.</p>
<p>He added that another purpose is also to intimidate the military.</p>
<p>"They say," Do not think to be captured, because in the Ukrainian captivity will be the same as we do with Ukrainian prisoners, " - said the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.</p>

<p>The war in Ukraine is ongoing, and the state must take care of Ukrainian children who are suffering from the consequences of armed aggression of the Russian Federation. On the eve of the summer season, the Social Policy made changes to the system of providing children with health services.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a separate program aimed at improving and resting children of confident categories of citizens. We have reformatted the help for children to recreate this season, including significantly increased its size(This is the installment of 5 subsistence minimums, about 14 thousand hryvnias). Крім того,відтепер батьки самі зможуть обрати кількість днів, коли дитина будеоздоровлюватись. Тож можна буде отримати дорожчу путівку на меншу кількістьднів або дешевшу путівку на більшу кількість днів, — зазначила ОксанаЖолнович.</li>
</ul>
<p>Батьки зможуть обрати путівку з переліку закладів, що внесені до реєстру йвідповідають усім вимогам щодо оздоровлення дітей. На сайті Національноїсоціальної служби буде опубліковано профайл кожного з таких закладів.</p>
<p>— Цього року ми обираємо дітей саме з прифронтових територій, дітей зінвалідністю, дітей з багатодітних родин, тобто тих, яким найскладнішезабезпечити оздоровлення. Кожному з них через портал «Дія», смс-повідомленнячи електронну пошту буде надіслана інформація про те, що вони мають право натаке оздоровлення. Все, що вимагається — це відкрити у ПриватБанку спеціальнийрахунок, куди надійдуть кошти, якими можна буде скористатися в одному зобраних оздоровчих закладів, — пояснила Міністр соцполітики.</p>
<p>За її словами, з міркувань безпеки цього року до запропонованого перелікувходять лише заклади Карпатського регіону: Чернівецька, Івано-Франківська,Львівська, Закарпатська області. Всі заклади вищої категорії, що тамрозташовані, мають право подавати заявки та укладати договори з Нацсоцслужбоюна надання таких послуг.</p>
<p>Крім того, Мінсоцполітики активно працює з міжнародними партнерами. Зокрема єдомовленість з Португалією, яка готова приймати окремі категорії українськихгромадян для оздоровлення.</p>

<p>“I sincerely regret that I have not joined you today because of the events that held in Kiev. I started my work day with the fact that my dear colleague of Reznikov - from calls and sms about accelerating the supply of weapons in Ukraine. This is what we do with him every day twenty -four to seven to prepare for the counter -offensive of Ukraine. And, of course, we were all released by horrible videos yesterday, and carried out yesterday, mobilizing an international reaction to this terrible crime, ”the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said.</p>

<li>It united peaceful countries that oppose aggression and occupation. The Charter and Principles of the UN and the common conviction are united that Crimea is Ukraine, and it must return to its control. And every time you hear someone from any corner of the world says that Crimea is something special and it is not worthwhile to regulate Ukraine as any other part of our territory, you must know: Ukraine is strongly disagreed with it. There is no difference between Simferopol, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson or any other city of Ukraine. They all have to be and will be with Ukraine again, as Kherson has done, - the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine emphasized.</li>

<ul>
<li>More than 400 days ago, Russia launched a large -scale invasion, and thousands of people were killed. The invasion has forced millions of Ukrainians of the abandoned home, destroyed entire cities, caused a military conflict of such a nogoviphsta, which Europe has not seen in the last 80 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has become apparent to European countries as weapons are used as weapons, energy is used as weapons, - the Reznikov emphasis.</p>
<p>The Minister of Defense also noted that exactly a year ago the Ukrainian Navy destroyed the Russian military cruiser "Moscow", and this became a very important known place for diving in the Black Sea.</p>
<p>It was also said that due to the violation of international humanitarian law and their commission of war crimes, it was necessary to unite in the creation of peace in the Black Sea region.</p>
<ul>
<li>violation of all existing principles of international law enforcement by the aggressor is a revision of the critical aspects of regional security.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in the interests of each country in the region. We cannot rely on the practice we have used - it did not produce. Ukraine is open, because the unity of efforts of the free world we will ensure the luminaries of law, not the rule of power. And we will make the Black Sea of space, - Alexei Reznikov summarized in his introductory speech.</p>

<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba announced this during the first Black Sea Security Conference of the International Crimean Platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we all agree today that Russian aggression has broken the security of the region into many pieces that need to be collected again. Many of us thought that the XXI century would be the century of peace and cooperation. Unfortunately, Russia went the opposite route and returned to the XIX century of the Caucasus, - said Dmytro Kuleba.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine thanked everyone and everyone in attendance for being close to Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>For those who support Ukraine around the world, so much light, courage, strength. I want to thank everyone and every one of you, attendees here, and that you were with us at the darkest hour. We are a community, united not by the values, but also by common sense and common sea. We all wanted it to be a peace and prosperity area, not a war zone. The Black Sea is a CEI tooling to make all Europe peaceful and peace -oriented. Unfortunately, the Black Sea is also an example of how quickly everything can get worse if you get threatened, - Dmytro Kuleba said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine noted that Russia has always been preparing a proven imperialist war to hold another Yalta Conference to divide Europe into spheres of influence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, I believed that the West did not have a consistent Black Sea strategy, then Russia always had it: aggressive, revenge. I would like to mention everyone that Russia's first proposal for territorial integrity of Ukraine: to place on the island of Tuzla in the Black Sea, located in the inter -red sea and other sea, - said Dmytro Kuleba.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T53-00-00-04-00/1-75.jpg" />Ukraine should take advantage of the opportunities of international courts, because for the first time Russia is not the first time the Ukrainian nation is destroyed. It is also important that the Russian Federation is international criminal liability for the omnipotence that it commits in our territory.</p>
<p>About it during <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/13/bryfing-predstavnykiv-syl-bezpeky-ta-oborony-ukrayiny-u-military-media-center-4/">briefing</a>The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said VMILITARY Media Center.</p>
<p>The charter provides for four crimes that are subject to the jurisdiction of the international court: war crimes, crimes against humanity, aggression and genocide.</p>
<p>“But the first and key crime is aggression. All other crimes are derivatives of depression. And the world must, on the example of the Russo-Ukrainian War, realize that all the instruments that were created before this to counteract such wars are not working, ”said Anna Malyar.</p>
<p>She recalled that since the Nuremberg process in the world, no sentence for aggression, where wars are constantly being constantly, have been announced.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the Russian-Ukrainian war should become the point from which the political will to punish aggressors in the world for such difficult, internationalist, in particular for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. And it is a one tool for all other aggressors that may have the same immibitions as Putin. If he and Russia are not punished, then it will solve it to all others, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.</p>

<h1>The enemy had to "modernize" Shahd 136 relay 30 years ago-Andrey Rudyk</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T56-00-00-04-00/5f6a3284-scaled.jpg" />The "import substitution" of the Russian Security Service of Ukraine now remains even at the level of individual parts of spare parts, but at the level of propaganda imagination of the Kremlin. This is especially true in the production and modernization of unmanned aerial vehicles. During a briefing at the Military Media Center, a representative of the Tropician Center for Perspective Weapons and Military equipment of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Rudyk said that it "combines" the scattered Iranianhad 136 and the less famous Russian Zala 421-16e.</p>
<p>_ <strong> Reference. </strong> Shahd 136 is a barrow ammunition known as Dron Kamikadze, which the Russian Federation has tried considerably to reduce civilian and critical infrastructure and continues the killing civilian population.__</p>
<p>Zala 421-16e is a reconnaissance drone, by which the aggressor cites a firearterleria into the position of our soldiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are two completely different UAVs. There is almost nothing in common in them - different buildings, types of engines, functionality. Our studies have shown that the last SHahd 136 and Zala 421-16e have a number of "modifications", which certify the constructive degradation and significant problems of the Russian MIC in the industry, modernization and maintenance of unmanned aerial vehicles,-Andrei Rudyk is told. - Unlike chips and chips, Russian federation is able to produce simple parts on its own - transistors, resonators, resistors and relays. The technologies of their production have been known for a long time inherited from the USSR. However, after all, the aggressor state faced the problem at this level. In the course of research of later specimens of Iranian wreck, Shahd 136 revealed relays of 30 years ago of non-Russian receipt. Equally eloquent is the fact that the enemy had to "modernize" the Iranian aircraft by adding this detail.</li>

<ul>
<li>In addition to the Russian "manipulations" from the UAV Shahd 136, it was found that Iran stopped denying his involvement in him. It is likely that the name "Geran-2" was chosen by the Russian Federation not only from the logic of the nomenclature of weapons, but also for the cover and issuance of this Ublaak of its development. It should be recalled that the Iranian origin of individual parts of the tsy drones was deliberately hidden. However, in recent months, the situation has changed, ”the officer said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present during the event showed a photo of a super -labeled Mado company - the first similar case.</p>
<p>-In addition to the "new" relay, the servicemen of the center found in the UAV Shahd 136 so-called GSM transverse. The main feature of this device is to accept and transmit information by the 3G, 4G GSM-standard channels. As it turned out, there is nothing Russian in it - no chip or chip. Even there are no Russian markings. There is also no traditional "brand" equipment for such equipment. Hence the conclusion that such a device was prepared and installed quickly. Although the marking of the central microprocessor is completely destroyed, and therefore not established origin. However, we can state that it is not Russian production, - says Andrei Rudyk.</p>
<p>-You can see some foreign components in Zala 421-16e. This processor, RAM, Internet Commercial and Audio Codek of Field Controller, Global Navigation Satellite Satellite Receiver, Air Value Sensor, Barometric High meter of Inertocial Navigation System, etc. It is worth noting that each of these components is not new. It is possible that they were used somewhere, before getting into this drone.The words of the speaker, found in both modifications, are evidenced by the prodigal facts. First of all, the Russian MIC is in principle not capable of providing a full cycle of production of own and maintenance of UAVs. Not only the basic components, but even the latest "modifications" are of foreign origin. It is obvious that the Russian MIC in the production of bplassically dependent on foreign components.</p>

<p>Emphasis on why this video was widespread right now, although it was clear that they were doing it in the summer, the Deputy of Ukraine emphasized that the authors or customers probably intended to intimidate us, Ukrainians.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although it is difficult to imagine what we can still be intimidated after a year of large -scale interruption of Russia in Ukraine. It can also be a struggle in the middle of Russian power elites. And now we have an assumption whose representatives have been united. In this way, they just heat each other, giving out such atrocities. Apparently, the people who did it did not do it for the first time. Maybe I will name terrible things, and they have some pleasure from it. They can shoot it to then look and assert themselves, or to report the commanders in the form of a report on the work done, - said the painter.</li>
</ul>
<p>She also stressed that it is good when such crimes did not remain heated. Because if it were not this video, we would have never been aware of what it could have happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a very big chance to condemn the people they committed. Of course, we can do it at our own national level, our courts and law enforcement agencies are able to do so professionally. Tap here is different as the world evaluates it. The fact is that this was not a crime in the middle of our country, our citizens. The main thing here is that there is an aggression of the Russian Federation in our territory - which is an international crime derived from it - war crimes, crimes against humanity. In the end, it is necessary to speak about genocide, which is carried out today by the Russian Federation of Revening to the Ukrainian People.</li>

Instead, foreign experts have been surprised and studied for a year how the Ukrainian military has been able to send Moscow to the bottom.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy and rainy day, the cruiser was 120 kilometers from Odessa, when he appeared on the radar of the operator PKR R-360 "Neptune".

As they lied to the prose, the very cause of flooding is an element of lies. In the example of history, we want to show how Moscow lies, how it does. We have Efacts and evidence. We say today that Muscovy cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>In May, shows will be shown to Ukrainians. After that, the residents of Belgium, Germany, Britain and America are only previous arrangements.</p>
