“Even before the full -scale invasion, it was part of the pool of political pioneers who worked for Medvedchuk. It was found that the person involved in the "reutation of" the media image of the Kremlin's associate as a "peacemaker", which is "heard" in Moscow. For this purpose he regularly published his posts on propaganda pre-platforms, ”the message reads.

In addition, in early 2020, he voluntarily began to work for the Russian Information "News-Front", which was registered in the temporarily occupied Crimea.

After the commencement of full -scale aggression of the Russian Federation, the person involved in Khmelnytsky has repeatedly spread publications, which called into question the existence of Ukrainian statehood in internationally recognized borders.

He also disseminated the defense forces and spread fakes with a proportional policy situation in Ukraine. The Linguistic Experts initiated by the SBU confirmed the facts of the subversive activity of the person.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the third meeting of the round table [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/uk/country/ukraine)on Ukraine's support.

_Text of the speech: _

** _ President Malass, thank you for your support. Ms. Director-Managor Crystalina, Mr. Vice president Dombrovskis ._ **

** _ ladies and gentlemen ministers, secretaries, heads of international financial institutions… _ **

Thank you all for this meeting, for your work in this format.

Now Ukraine is experiencing special emotions. Yesterday, Russian sources were widespread on the Internet video of the animal murder of our soldier by the occupiers.

They, in the video, boast about their ability to kill. Apparently, you have all seen what is being said. And you know that this level of violence, this level of destruction, the Russian army tries to make a routine everywhere on Ukrainian lands.

You cannot get used to it. Every time shock as they first do something.

The death of Russia should not become a routine!The long history of Russian freeness should finally stop.

I thank everyone in the world, thank everyone and every one of you who helps Ukrainian to play!But every day ... Every day we lose our people - men and women, adults and children who die from Russian hands ...

I ask you now to pay a moment of silence to the memory of this Ukrainian, whose death saw yesterday, and the memory of all our people whose lives were worn by Russian invasion.

Thank you. This is very important for all of us.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T02-00-00-04-00/12-4.jpg)** _ Dear present!_ **

Ukraine will win this war. Only the question of the time when Russian aggression is illuminated.

But the state-zla should not remain a chance to defeat the ruins.

What is the purpose of the terrorist always? To break life. If you do not kill, then cripple. If it is destroyed, then make it suffer.

Any aggressor that hates life-whether it acts at the state level, Yakovia, whether at the level of terrorist group, or at the level of one degraded personality ... The aggressor always enjoys when it destroys. And when the ruins of after aggression have to overcome for decades.Supporting rapid recovery is literally part of the anti -terrorist work. Cleaning what has been destroyed, we win the main target - we return a normal life.

The second point is assets of the state.

For the first time in history, the world has such a large -scale opportunity to harvest losses from an uncontrollable and illegal war on the aggressor - to be guilty of war.

For example, the World Bank has given a new estimate of the losses and needs of Ukraine with a volume of $ 411 million. Every day Russia increases this account. The world has Russian jacobes of different species that cover this level of losses!

Potential aggressors in the world are now looking at whether you are doing the right one. Conflicting Russian assets, as well as assets of persons related to the governing building of the state, real. Confiscate and direct that the life of in Ukraine could recover. Russia should feel the full price of its aggression.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-13T02-00-00-04-00/13-4.jpg)**_Ladies and Gentlemen!_**

Ukraine appeals to you with two calls. The first: priority needs.

I thank you for the new IMF cooperation program, which is a significant stabilization process for Ukraine. This will help us to fight. But in order for people to turn to Ukraine so that the aggressor will lose not only on the battlefield, but literally, we need the approval of the support program to cover the first -time prosets of rapid recovery. The total volume of such projects is $ 14.1 billion. Our government officials, who are now in Washington, are presenting.

And second. It is already necessary to work on specific mechanisms of directing the frozen Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by Russia. Treachitko declare that assets, including the assets of the Russian Central Bank, will be confiscated. It will be the peacekeeping act - an inflammatory scale. Potential aggressors should see it. And remember that the world can be strong.

There may be different formats of decisions, but the faster and more effective decisions will be, the more to the more will be peace after this war.

**_Ladies and Gentlemen!_**

There are no minor fronts in the war. Everyone needs attention and strength. Financial front - especially. We do our part of the work and I am grateful to everyone who helps. But fundamental solutions depend on you.

I believe they will be approved!

Thank you for your attention!Glory to all who are now in battle for life and freedom for our people!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

In addition, unlike the first part of partial mobilization, even Moscow and St. Petersburg joined the necessary indicators, in addition to depressive regions of the Russian Federation.

On March 30, Putin signed a decree on the six -year spring conscription military service from April 1 to July 15, during which 147,000 Russians between the ages of 18 and 27 will be drafted. Russia conducts two cylm a year, during the spring call is usually called 134 thousand Russians. At the same time, according to British intelligence, the Russian authorities are preparing to develop a large campaign for a set of additional 400 thousand servicemen.

And in order for the Russians to be left with a chance to avoid conscription, the State Duma would accept a series of laws on the creation of a Unified Register of Military Treatment of Electronic Tales on April 11.

The adopted package of laws is as rigid as possible and actually introduces the preinterrestation of guilt. It equates electronic reports to paper and a closing visit abroad to citizens who will fall into the register. The introduced electronic statement will be considered as prescribed from the moment of placement in the personal office of the state service "State Services"(The only platform of public and municipal services of the Russian Federation).Тобто чоловік може не знати, що йому виписана повістка, але через 7 днів післяїї формування він автоматично стає злочинцем. Нові правила торкнуться якстроковиків, так і всіх військовозобов’язаних, а за їх ігнорування ухилянтамзагрожує низка покарань. Серед обмежень: заборона на реєстраціюіндивідуального підприємця, на державну реєстрацію транспортних засобів,водіння, відмова в укладенні кредитного договору та договору позики.

Звичні схеми ухилення за такого механізму неможливі, як неможливо і легальнозмінити військову службу на альтернативну, тобто росіян поставили у безвихідь,якої не було з часів радянського союзу.

Характерно, що влада продовжує наполягати, що нововведення не пов’язані змобілізацією, а лише поліпшують процедуру вручення повісток і військовогообліку, а проведення мобілізації зараз в країні нібито не планується.

До чого може призвести новий призов і чи посилить він військовий потенціал зсрф?

Secondly, Putin is unlikely to decide to use the recently called troops in Ukraine. In addition, the chairman of the State Duma Committee of Rfartpolov emphasized that during the spring conscript cycle of 2023, the prisoners will not go to Ukraine. Against the backdrop of social tension of tamas protest shares due to the departure to the front of recruits, the winter and spring prison of 2022, it is doubtful that Putin will risk repeating a mistake due to the stability of his regime.

Third, the use of innovations will predict a sharp burst and provokes a new wave of emigration and other methods of boycotters. The Levada survey shows an increase in the "request for peace" in Russian society. If in the first months for the "war before victory" and for "peaceful interpretations" was expressed an equal number of citizens(approximately 44%), then after the first wave of mobilization - already 60% for peace, and only a third - for the continuation. In the Russian segment of the Steam Game Platform, even the viral distribution of the computer game "Simulator Escape from the military enlistment office", the character of which the youth Russian is doing everything to avoid the call.

Therefore, conducting hidden mobilization under the guise of "Putin's call" of Taurus of digital authoritarian tools will not help the Kremlin achieved goals in Ukraine and consolidate power within Russia.

“The event was so inspiring and incredible at the same time that many seemed to be true. After all, Russia has lost its flagship of overpayment ago, ”he said.

Our warriors, according to Alexei Reznikov, made it seemingly impossible. It changed the course of history. Because the chain reaction began. It was the last day of the Russian fleet on the Black Sea.

"** first **, the successful use of Ukrainian missiles at such a distance has convinced partners that there is no point in delaying the transfer of Harpoon missiles.

*!As a result, this led to the escape invaders from the island of Snake, which they called "a gesture of goodwill."

** Third **, the release of the snake made it possible to open a "grain corridor". Our products were worldly supported, Ukraine has received resources for defense. If it was not possible to make Moscow, it would be impossible to achieve this result.

As a result, the Russian fleet is forced to hide south and east of the Crimea. Kremliv's dreams of landing in Odessa remained in the past. Now the Russians can be cowardly firing civilians from the air, ” - said the Glava of the Defense Office of Ukraine.

Alexei Reznikov summed up: the main conclusion from this story is our country and to decide how to protect it. Even if someone still cares about Kreml's face.

“It is proven in combat that Made in Ukraine weapons are able to cope with more acquired tasks and protect on level with the best partner development. The development of the Ukrainian MIC is a priority because it is an element of our respectiveness.

Our success on the battlefield is the key to what they will support us, ” - he is convinced.

So now the most important thing, as the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine noted, is to support our defenders and defenders, to maintain unity, step by step to the goal. Victory is inevitable.

And for all these crimes, there is an international legal assessment, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar on the united information telephone today, commenting on the terrible execution of the Ukrainian serviceman of the Russian serviceman.

Emphasis on why this video was widespread right now, although it was clear that they were doing it in the summer, the Deputy of Ukraine emphasized that the authors or customers probably intended to intimidate us, Ukrainians.

- Although it is difficult to imagine what we can still be intimidated after a year of large -scale interruption of Russia in Ukraine. It can also be a struggle in the middle of Russian power elites. And now we have an assumption whose representatives have been united. In this way, they just heat each other, giving out such atrocities. Apparently, the people who did it did not do it for the first time. Maybe I will name terrible things, and they have some pleasure from it. They can shoot it to then look and assert themselves, or to report the commanders in the form of a report on the work done, - said the painter.

She also stressed that it is good when such crimes did not remain heated. Because if it were not this video, we would have never been aware of what it could have happened.

- We have a very big chance to condemn the people they committed. Of course, we can do it at our own national level, our courts and law enforcement agencies are able to do so professionally. Tap here is different as the world evaluates it. The fact is that this was not a crime in the middle of our country, our citizens. The main thing here is that there is an aggression of the Russian Federation in our territory - which is an international crime derived from it - war crimes, crimes against humanity. In the end, it is necessary to speak about genocide, which is carried out today by the Russian Federation of Revening to the Ukrainian People.

He stated this on the national telephone "Unified News".

"Today we are getting more and more help from our partners. But what is enough or not enough of these weapons, I will tell you that it will never be enough. There is no such phrase as "sufficient arms" in the war. Our military has a great desire to have weapons as soon as possible in order to destroy those terrorists who have invaded our territory as soon as possible, ”the NSDC secretary stressed.

He also noted that there were "certain delays" in the supply of weapons, which partners of Ukraine were referred to.

“I want to pay attention to the President's words that we are waiting for the promised help of our partners. I can note that, unfortunately, not all partners have gone over. Supply is going now - I cannot say that it is not - but they are delays on certain issues. We will assume that this is a temporary -maturity that will be worked out, ”Alexei Danilov said.

He also stressed that Ukraine rests not only on partners, but also on "many other channels" that allow you to buy weapons for defense forces, the process continues daily.

At the same time, the NSDC secretary did not specify what kind of weapons it was.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said this in Vienna, answering questions of journalists during a press conference with Austrian leader Alexander Vander Bellen, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“I'm not afraid of that. We are trying to intimidate, to cause psychosis. Putinama is frightening, first of all, Western Europe, that he will unfold nuclear Ararsenal, to bring nuclear warheads closer to the borders of Western Europe, ”he said [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-duda).

The President of the RP expressed his belief that the presence of NATO and the increased presence of US army in Eastern Europe, including Poland, "weaken the possibility of aggressive Russia."

Duda emphasized that he has more concern for the fate of Ukrainian NPPs, which are now in danger, including the captured by the Russians of Zaporizhzhya.

He stressed that this kind of nuclear threat from the Russians is more concern than, allegedly, the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus.

“If the Allies decide that in the question of NATO membership, they simply confirmed the 130th time of the open door policy, then for Ukraine it is an unacceptable result of the Vilnius summit. If they try to offer us some positive things about deepening NATO cooperation, but will not take any step towards Ukraine's membership in NATO, then it is an unacceptable one for us, ”the Foreign Minister said.

Kuleba explained that the position of Ukraine is that in Vilnius NATO should take a step towards Ukraine's membership and resolve the issue of safety for Ukraine between the current and the moment when Ukraine becomes the Alliance.

"But we will in no way make surrogate decisions ... This is the same as a candidate:" But let's not candidate, give some alternative, special ..., half -measures. " No need to repeat the same game at the level [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato). It is necessary to provide what is in line with the interests of both NATO and Ukraine, ”the minister emphasized.

Only 6% of respondents believe that relations between the interior and Ukraine will not change.

This is evidenced by the survey "Military Refugees from Ukraine. Year in Poland ”, conducted by the EWL migration platform and the center of Eastern European Studio University at the request of the office of the Prime Minister of Poland, Ukrinform reports.

The authors of the study assure that such a vision is a consequence of support for taolidarity with Ukraine of Polish society in the first days of Russian tinigence. These are specific measures for assistance to Ukraine and Ukrainians on the side of the central authorities of the RP, local self -government bodies, entrepreneurs and public organizations.

Many Poles still live with Ukraine from Ukraine. For example, large women who are difficult to rent a housing expense, ” - Chairman of the Board of EWL Migration Platform Andrzej Korkus.

He noted that he was known for examples when women from the north or south of Ukraine had already returned home, when it became more or less safe, but in the winter, the enhanced shelling and the exclusion of light went to Polish families again, who had already taken them and invited them to wait for a difficult time. In his opinion, all this strengthens relations between countries at the human level.

“Of course, Ukrainian refugees see how active Poland is fighting for Ukraine at the same level - political, military, diplomatic. In turn, they hear the Poles with the fascination with the heroic struggle and endurance of Ukrainians, ”Corcus said.

This was emphasized by the Expremy Minister of Ukraine, the chairman of the Kiev Security Forum Arseniy Yatsenyuk, commenting on the words of Le Pen that "the victory of Russia is BUDGASTrophe, and the victory of Ukraine will mean entering the NATO war and solving the world", Ukrinform reports with reference to [](http://ksf.openukraine.org/ua/news/2608-vstup-ukrajini-v-natobude-peremogoju-dlya-vsih-i-katastrofoju-dlya-rosijsykoji-imperijiarsenij-jacenyuk-pro-zajavu-le-pen?fbclid=IwAR0Bp7o7ZIL7_4hWFYo4kVtK5ObP5Ltufd0nNMxgLzzfD0opRiR07Wv4Doo)KBF.

"What Le Pen says is the modern repetition of the Munich conspiracy's logic with a nickname in 1938. They also thought: if Hitler wins, it will be all-in-catastrophe. But if Czechoslovakia repels, then the Great War will. The conspiracy was signed. The war began. One of the first inpalafranation, ”he emphasized.

Yatsenyuk stated that “the victory of Ukraine is the liberation of our land from the enemy of the enemy in [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)”.

“Want peace? Support Ukraine with all possible forces and, without spending time, take to the North Atlantic Alliance. Stop throwing empty words in the second year of a full -scale invasion and spreading the world of imagination. Showing a common enemy that you have a true force to protect the just wick system, ”the CBF chairman said.

He is convinced that the war will end when the Ukrainian flag will rise as a flag of a full member of the Alliance before NATO's headquarters. And it will be a victory for everyone. And the catastrophe is for the Russian Imperia, ”Yatsenyuk said.

She told about it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent after the trainery at the Ukrainian Fencing Championship.

“We cannot participate in competitions with athletes from Russia and Belarus, so if they come, we will not compete. The decision of the Ministry of Sports of Sports is very difficult, which is probably both the President of Ukraine and the Ministry of Justice. I cannot say that it will all be supported by 100 percent. We have one enemy, Russia, which is now on our earth, to do everything that is not allowed. If they are allowed, for sports, including fencing, very difficult times will come, ”she said.

Harlan also emphasized that it was necessary to do everything to keep Russians and Belarus not to the Olympics.

“I would say a lot(President and Mok Thomasu Bachu - Red.), but, I think, all athletes, in particular I, we make comments to foreign media, in which we express my opinion. It is very difficult to hold back emotions, but we need to convey to the world what is happening, and why the Russians should not be at the Olympics, ” - said.

Today, on April 14, Olga Harlan took part in the Ukrainian Failure Championship in Kiev, where she took first place.

“I missed Kiev very much, for Ukraine. At home is always good. It is even better. I evaluate my physical condition well. It is more difficult about psychological, moral state to speak. I train regularly, get ready for the Olympic selection. Since the situation is very difficult with everything, the big question is whether we can get to the competition, ”the Olympic fencing champion said.

Precautionary measures were also taken against the suspect - he must appear in court and pass the passport so that he could not leave Spain.

The judge stated that such a decision was made because it was no longer risky that the suspect could destroy the evidence and there is no evidence that he would repeat the crimes he was accused of.

If the suspect is found guilty, he may be threatened with up to 20 years of imprisonment for terrorist crimes.

“Since the full -scale Russian invasion [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna)It has been going on for over a year. Not able to interfere on the battlefield, Russia does not leave attempts to impose the world by the power of what is happening in Ukraine and Ukraine.

In particular, compilers [](https://spravdi.gov.ua/slovnyk-terminologiyi-shhodo-podij-v-ukrayini/)It is noted that it is wrong to write and speak Ukrainian. Correct formulations: "Russian invasion of Ukraine", "Russian-Ukrainian war".

Ukrinform provides the full text of the President of Ukraine.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He spoke with Rice Sunak today, Prime Minister of Great Britain.

First of all, I am grateful to him and all the leaders of the world who have condemned the brutal murder of a more soldier, the murder to whom the invaders swayed.

The invaders feel what it means when the world is condemned.

We discussed with Prime Minister Sunak's weapons for our soldiers-we were about to speak with Britain, what will help our active actions, quite fair actions. Discussed the acceleration of supply…

The more farm the Ukrainian actions, the faster the Russian relations will end.

Of course, we continue our work on the aviation coalition for Ukraine, the preparation of various international events that will give us all in Europe more and protection.It is obvious that the place of Ukraine is in NATO, a legitimate place. And we do not want to have the same illusions, which still held back our accession to the Alliance, and also aumed time to take time from Ukraine and partners. We develop correspondence.

Today, however, he held a meeting on the restoration of our country - the restoration of post -fighting. First Vice Prime Minister Yulia Sviridenko, Vice Prime Minister and Ministry of Recovery ...

They discussed what is concerned with infrastructure, economy and many other questions that need answers, very costly answers. We work in the countries of the country, and with partners for the sake of the systematic restoration, for the kind, that the result meets the expectations of our society - quite highly. I am sure we will do everything.

During the day he was in touch with the military, held a meeting with the head of the Service of Ukraine of Ukraine, he held a meeting with the head of GUR Budanov.

The key is the constant destruction of the invaders, it is the "minus" of their logistics and any potential in the occupied territories, it is the preparation of our active events, it is countercurrent work. And I thank all our warrior soldiers, who remember that for every Russian blow to our cities, in our positions, for every murder of Ukrainians, the occupier must suggest their maximum loss. Each meter of Ukrainian land should be determined for the occupier by the inevitability of the loss of Russia in this war, the inevitable that there will be no prospect for the enemy on the land of Ukraine.

The 14th Brigade and the 1st Presidential Brigade of Operations Guard-Thank you guys for sustainability!54th Separate Mechanical Oblast named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, 5th Separate Storm Brigade, 77-MOROCE APPRY BRANCE-Well done, warriors!Keeping defense on Donetskinarase is the hardest. But it gives life to Ukraine.

Rescue work is now underway in the Slovian Donetsk region. Another strike of terrorists. C-300 rockets in residential quarters, on ordinary civilian. There are people under the rubble. Everything is done to save them, everything is done to save the wounded. There are first data on the dead. My condolences to the herself, he wrapped my relatives.

One hour this week was not without Russian murder of Irotera. This is a state-zlo, and it is program _a_. To win is our duty as a pre -person. And we will win!Thank you all who oppose evil with Ukraine!Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for the state and people!

This is evidenced by the data of the international energy agency(May), reports Ukrinform with reference to [](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/russia-sanctions-work-as-designed-with-oil-flow-up-revenue-down).

As it is noted, daily exports of Russian oil on average amounted to 8.1 million in the day of last month, which is the highest indicator since April 2020. The Mea emphasized that the discounts made by Russia, attract traders, prepare.

Western countries and their allies have approved several waves of sanctions to reduce Russia's exports from oil exports, a key source of income for its national budget. Restrictions are aimed at limiting the opportunity to finance his war in Ukraine.

This forced Russia to look for alternative markets in the Middle East and Latin amite, as well as to expand supply to Asia, but price restrictions on countries G made these new clients have the opportunity to negotiate discounts. Restrictions are predicted that buyers from third countries can access Western services, such as insurance and delivery, only if they are maintained.

According to Mea, last month Russian crude oil and petroleum products were sold much cheaper than price limits. The average export price for Russian oil was $ 50.67 per barrel compared to the ceiling of $ 60, calculated by the IEA based on Argus Media Group and Kpler data. According to this agency, it is also almost $ 2 a barrel below the average price for February.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-14T21-51-00-03-00/630_360_1670682428-944.jpg)For Ukraine, it will be unacceptable if the NATO Allies in Vilnius have a lot of open doors and do not take a single step of the dawn.

This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleb during a location in [](http://www.instagram.com/p/CrBfvJ-gTlB/), reports Ukrinform.

“If the Allies decide that in the question of NATO membership, they simply confirmed the 130th time of the open door policy, then for Ukraine it is an unacceptable result of the Vilnius summit. If they try to offer us some positive things about deepening NATO cooperation, but will not take any step towards Ukraine's membership in NATO, then it is an unacceptable one for us, ”the Foreign Minister said.

Kuleba explained that the position of Ukraine is that in Vilnius NATO should take a step towards Ukraine's membership and resolve the issue of safety for Ukraine between the current and the moment when Ukraine becomes the Alliance.

"But we will in no way make surrogate decisions ... This is the same as a candidate:" But let's not candidate, give some alternative, special ..., half -measures. " No need to repeat the same game at the level [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato). It is necessary to provide what is in line with the interests of both NATO and Ukraine, ”the minister emphasized.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said this in Vienna, answering questions of journalists during a press conference with Austrian leader Alexander Vander Bellen, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“I'm not afraid of that. We are trying to intimidate, to cause psychosis. Putinama is frightening, first of all, Western Europe, that he will unfold nuclear Ararsenal, to bring nuclear warheads closer to the borders of Western Europe, ”he said [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-duda).

The President of the RP expressed his belief that the presence of NATO and the increased presence of US army in Eastern Europe, including Poland, "weaken the possibility of aggressive Russia."

Duda emphasized that he has more concern for the fate of Ukrainian NPPs, which are now in danger, including the captured by the Russians of Zaporizhzhya.

He stressed that this kind of nuclear threat from the Russians is more concern than, allegedly, the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus.

I hope that these practices will soon become a nation in the entire prosecutor's office. Despite all the challenges of the war, we work on this day, - said Andrei Kostin.

The competition for the positions of such coordinators will begin in the near future.

- ensuring the connection between the victims/witnesses and prosecutors in the proceedings;

Thus, they are to deprive our defenders of the opportunity to keep positions in the city community, ”said Anna Malyar, on the air of the Unified Information Teleterna of Ukraine.

- It's their style, otherwise they lose. You look at what they do. The enemy has now concentrated there, in addition to the Wagnets, his elite units, landing units and special forces. In order to stop them, IIU answer must concentrate more of their efforts. It is important to understand here - why we stop them and why we stand in Bakhmut!First, Bakhmut is important for the Russians, if they concentrate such forces and means there.

Secondly-if we do not defend Bakhmut, and in fact his defense continues in August, then the enemy will move on. Therefore, this issue, discussion, and discussions are some kind of narrative. For Ukrainians, there can be no land more important. For us, every meter of land is strategically important, - said the deputy of Ukraine.

Anna Malyar also noted that in these 8 months of defense of Bakhmut the forces of defense of Ukraine, our courageous warriors destroyed thousands of Russian the most professional fighters, a huge number of their equipment, and reduced essentially their offensive potential. And focusing the efforts of the enemy, where we do not allow him to overcome these forces and means to another area of the front.

- At the same time, I remind that the enemy today comes not only on the Bakhmut Napryamka, but on four at the same time - it is also Avdiivsky, Marinski, Lymansky. The enemy still seeks to go to administrative bordondone and Luhansk regions. Their ultimate goal is to capture and destroy all Ukraine. But after the defense forces were liberated Kyiv, North Ukraine, Kharkiv, Kherson, they decided to move in stages, so now they have a first -line task - our East.

Colonel Yuriy Ignat, spokeswoman for the United Nations Air Force forces of Ukraine, told this on the only news.

-Using this technique, we can restore our own fighter-mmig-29 park,-he stressed. - add a certain amount of modern weapons to them. And it will improve our capabilities in the current tasks. But to win, to achieve the preference in the air, we need fighters, which are now all over-F-16 planes. That is why we are waiting for a modern weapon that can be able to reconnect the course of the war.

With regard to the possible mass production of Russia, the winged rockets of the type X-50, Colonel Yuri Ignat noted:

- The Russians have used their main stock of missiles to strikes in critical infrastructure of Ukraine. Since the fall of last year, or more precisely since September 11, they have used more than 850 winged missiles of different types. This is very significant for them.

According to the officer, the statement of the Russian leadership to restore the production of vascular missiles X-50, which were developed in the Soviet Union, is due to the fact that our enemy has more resources to produce this kind of preference.

"This is a rush rocket winged at a speed of 850-900 kilometers per hour," he said. - And the fact that Russia has declared the intentions of its production, only a blank statement. Because it is not so easy to start such production in the conditions of sanctions.

However, Ukrainians should not relax and neglect airy.

Now the pilot is studying English in depth, so that after making a decision on the transmission of Ukraine F-16, the faster to move to a 4+ multi-purpose fighter.

While it is necessary to fight on aircraft development of the 70-80s. Then, for example, the Russian aircraft, for example, SU-30, SU-34, SU-35, were deep-gauge.

- Consider not the number of aircraft, though it is clear that it is not a parity, namely technological capabilities. The main indicator of the efficient work of a fighter aircraft is the destruction of air goals. In order to allow the effectiveness of this work, the following key components are required - a parole radar station and a means of damage. Unfortunately, the enemy is dominated by both criteria. Their RLS-ki see at times farther than ours. And the range of Russian rocket P-77 is twice as high as our means. In addition, they have new R-37 missiles with a range of up to two hundred kilometers, which we cannot counteract. Therefore, our pilots have to more rise at times.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-14T83-00-00-04-00/img-20230212-wa0001-1.jpg)Vadim Voroshilov explains another important point that concerns controlled Iviation missiles: if we have - with semi -active heads of homing, then the enemy - with active ones.

- What does it mean? If I have to continue the flight and illuminate the enemy air target after starting, then the Russians perform many more distance. After capture, the active head of the self -esteem directs the rocket to it, meanwhile, the aircraft leaves the battlefield, it flies home, without entering the area of lesions of our system -prototype defense.

Karaya summarized: to move to the de -occupation of territories and win in this, we critically need a technique that is able to counteract the Russians. It is needed once, and now!And first of all, multi -purpose fighters of the 4+ tadotal amount of long -range air defense.

Насправді ж, цифри і факти говорять самі за себе. Втрати ворога у Бахмуті врази вищі. Бувають дні коли різниця сягає 10-ти разів.

Не шкодують людей ті, хто дає команду наступати на нашу землю і хтосконцентрував у Бахмуті найбільші свої зусилля аби будь-якою ціною взяти містопід контроль.

Ми ж натомість обороняємось і зупиняємо ворога від просування вглиб території.На жаль — це війна, і без втрат оборона неможлива.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/kozhen-metr-ukrayinskoyi-zemli-maye-oznachati-dlya-okupanta-82273)During his video address:

“I wish health, dear Ukrainians!

He spoke with Rice Sunak today, Prime Minister of Great Britain.

First of all, I am grateful to him and all the leaders of the world who have condemned the brutal murder of a more soldier, the murder to whom the invaders swayed.

The invaders feel what it means when the world is condemned.

We discussed with Prime Minister Sunak's weapons for our soldiers-we were about to speak with Britain, what will help our active actions, quite fair actions. Discussed the acceleration of supply…

The more farm the Ukrainian actions, the faster the Russian relations will end.

Of course, we continue our work on the aviation coalition for Ukraine, the preparation of various international events that will give us all in Europe more and protection.

He held a meeting today on Euro -Atlantic integration, on the inevitability of building potentials of Ukraine and NATO. Substantive meeting: Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, officials-profile Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister,-Outdoor Political Block of the Office, Head of the Office.

It is obvious that the place of Ukraine is in NATO, a legitimate place. And we do not want to have the same illusions, which still held back our accession to the Alliance, and also aumed time to take time from Ukraine and partners. We develop correspondence.

Today, however, he held a meeting on the restoration of our country - the restoration of post -combat actions. First Vice Prime Minister Yulia Sviridenko, Vice Prime Minister and Ministry of Recovery ...

They discussed what is concerned with infrastructure, economy and many other questions that need answers, very costly answers. We work in the countries of the country, and with partners for the sake of the systematic restoration, for the kind, that the result meets the expectations of our society - quite highly. I am sure we will do everything.

During the day he was in touch with the military, held a meeting with the head of the Service of Ukraine of Ukraine, he held a meeting with the head of GUR Budanov.The 14th Brigade and the 1st Presidential Brigade of Operations Guard-Thank you guys for stability!54th Separate Mechanical Variat named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, 5th Separate Storm Brigade, 77-MOROCE APPRY BRANCE-Well done, warriors!Keeping defense on Donetskinarase is the hardest. But it gives life to Ukraine.

Rescue work is now underway in the Slovian Donetsk region. Another strike of terrorists. C-300 rockets in residential quarters, on ordinary civilian. There are people under the rubble. Everything is done to save them, everything is done to save the wounded. There are first data on the dead. My condolences to the herself, he wrapped my relatives.

One hour this week was not without Russian murder of Irotera. This is a zlo state, and it loses. To win is our duty as a pre -humanity as such. And we will win!

And one more. What has long been needed for a solution for a long time. The life of Mikhail Saakashvilism does not depend now not on the political, not a personal but purely devastated solution ... which has a clean and significant legal framework. If a person is needed for help, if life depends on it, then this step is needed. I know that Michael's lawyers have now submitted an urgent appeal to the ECtHR to ensure that he or she has proper treatment. And it seems to be the only way to keep life.

Thank you all who oppose evil with Ukraine!Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle for the state and people!

Glory to Ukraine!".

🔶 Manipulation

❌ The American edition of Politico believes that Ukraine does not suit the United States of Ukraine: “States and Ukraine are not as synchronous as they declare… It can make a decrease in trust between Washington and Kiev before the decisive months of war that will dictate the course of war with Russia”

NATO headed by Sysha is a classic example of a "paper tiger": it is only dangerous to the first review, but in the event of a real threat is not able to do anything serious.
