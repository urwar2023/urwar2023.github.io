 Today in a straight ether The only news of the Air Force Air Forces spokesman Yuri Ignat told how Russians try to resuscitate their old weapons production.
-Nowadays, various media and publications are discussing the issue of production of the X-50 missiles by the Russian Federation,-the officer said. -It is not a new project, it was recognized as inappropriate, and instead of these missiles the Russians produced rates of type X-101. Now they are trying to run in production X-50. These missiles can also fly far, affecting different points of Ukraine. However, it is not the fact that the Russian industry is still capable of conducting such a project.
Now, according to Colonel Yuri Ignat, the greatest attention of the enemy is paid to the question of the increase in the use of managed aviation bombs. Moreover, the ultimate publication is actively discussing the possibility of processing all the insecution of aviation bombs from free fall ammunition in managed airplaces. It is not easy to do so in such volumes, because Russia is still in high reserves of Soviet aviation means. It will show how much the Russian "defense" will be able to cope with this task.
While the Russians are increasing the rate of production of unmanned aerial vehicles, because the experience of hostilities has shown the prospects for their use. Some enterprises of the Russian defense industry are even re -profiled by the production of UAV of different types.
Answering the questions of journalists to reduce the intensity of the Iranian Shahaneda's enemy, Colonel Yuriy Ignat noted that, as we know, a week ago, a cargo aircraft from Iran flew to Russia - could just brought a new batch of these barrading ammunition. Therefore, such an increase in hostile activity should be expected. However, not the "shahads" are the only ones. Today, the Russians are increasingly used by percussion UAVs, such as Lancet. Our experts have already developed tactics for counteracting these defeat, and they are increasingly being knocked down by Ukrainian defenders.

“News of Russian IPSO.
Today, the enemy was emphasized on our losses, including Bakhmut Boyachz and in the suburbs.
▪️ METTER
use an emotionally sensitive topic to:
✔️ to form distrust of military leadership decisions
✔️Wone blame for killed Ukrainians from themselves on us
They and the figures of the fake spread, and our cemeteries showed, and in our words they were told as if we were indifferent to the bodies of the dead.
Another Russian narrative was created.
The fact is that such flashy facts of war cannot be interrupted by a misrepresentation in social networks or media.
The facts are too obvious:
“Each death of Ukrainian military or civilian is a direct consequence
➖ In the enemy there is a choice - it can be taken from our land. We do not have a choice - we misery our state
➖The enemy losses are disorderly higher
Unfortunately, the price of freedom of our country is high - these are the dead heroes. We will finish that they have not had time - we will destroy the enemy and liberate our lands.
Eternal respect and memory of every fallen defender. "

At the same time, the Avdiivsky and Marinsky Napryamka remain very hot. However, despite the high intensity of assault actions, it does not use equipment here. This, according to the chief of the united Press Center of Defense Forces of Tavriysk, is associated not only with weather conditions, but also with problems of logistics.
Commenting on the appearance in the area of responsibility of the so-called assault units of Z, Colonel Alexei Dmitrashkivsky noted that they changed at the positions the units of two airborne regiments, which were significant losses. The infantry of the enemy who are currently on the recovery may not recover from losses. So now, instead of these regular troops, Ukrainian positions storm yesterday's prisoners, which belong not to the Private Naval Company "Wagner", but to Rosarmia.
According to Colonel Alexei Dmitrashkivsky, these Z's units have their own -refined recommendations other than Rosarmia's statutes. They got into the hand of Ukrainian defenders together with 15 captured storms. Methods and data obtained from captives indicate a low moral and psychological state in these units. In particular, the disrespectful attitude of the commanders to the subordinates, as well as the name and even imitation of shootings for refusing to participate in the fighting.

With such The Polish-Ukrainian Commercial Chamber was performed(Pugp)In Warsaw, it was amazing that the “struck” disposal of the Minister of Development and Technology in this case, Ukrinform reports.
“We ask the government to check the decision and initiate terminal consultations with the business community and the public. Only through the dialogue it is possible to make more balanced decisions, taking into account the interests of Polish agricultural producers and the dramatic situation in Ukraine, ”the Chamber reads.
Read also: As it is noted, PUGP appealed to its members to express their thoughts, on the basis of which the minister will be presented with conclusions and recommendations.
"The introduction of a ban on imports of goods was not preceded by consultations, and it hits the Polish entrepreneurs who import products, which is then exported to other markets," - emphasized the PUGP president, former ministry [] Jacek Naphot.
An example is honey imported from Ukraine and is one of the products specified in the resolution. It is noted that the import of honey from Ukraine to the EU in 2020 amounted to 54.8 thousand tons, in 2021 - 53.8 thousand tons, while in the row this figure fell sharply and amounted to 43.9 thousand tons. As of April 1, 20123, it was 10.5 thousand tons, which is 2.8 thousand tons less than the previous year.

The lack of access to this raw material for many plant and soybean feeds and products will mean that the production cyl will be stopped. It is emphasized that unilateral actions on trade from the EU Member of the EU must receive a response from the European Commission.
"Problems that have not been noticed before, today mean disproportionate solutions. We urge the government for subject consultations. As a logistics hub for Ukraine, Poland has become its largest window in the world after the Black Sea port blockade. This means the need for optimization The joint and several conditions of trade, not the introduction of Zaboron into Ukrainian goods, which at the same time can be imported from Russia, " - emphasizes in the statement Vice president Pugp Dariusz Shimchikha.
As reported by the agency, on April 15, the order of the Minister of Development and Technologies of Poland on the ban on the importation into the RP of agricultural products from Ukraine came into force. The document introduces a ban by June 30 on the import of a wide list of Ukrainian products, including grain, fruits, vegetables, meat, sugar, honey, wine and more.

“The propagandist Keoosyan stated that with the phrase of the“ brotherly people ”about the Ukrainians to“ tie ”. She seems to confuse people.
He also added that the Russians were fighting in the fields of "their" Ukraine with "Ecumenical Evil".
In these words, Keosan destroyed the long -standing narrative of Rospropaganda about the "brother -in -law of Ukraine".
The disgraced propagandist also began to justify the murders of peaceful Ukrainian terrorists of the Wagner PEC, although earlier all Putin media stated that Russian was not able to commit such crimes
The birth of new narratives indicates that all the previous ones are not justified by the Kremlin. Also, it is likely to be evidence that Russia is trying to create a new occasion for large -scale mobilization of Russia. "

 The Russian -specific services have set up numerous Radio intelligence systems in Europe that served Russian diplomats from these countries.
According to Ukrinform, this is stated in the investigation .
It is noted that most of these antennas are installed on the building The Russian Federation in Brussels is 17. At the Dakhakh Russian embassies in Madrid, Belgrade, Lisbon, Sofia and Nicosia, 10 of them are 10 and more. In total, at least 182 antennas have been drawn up on 39 Russian embassies and consulates in Europe. However, as the investigators point out, not all of them are externally, so their real number is probably even greater.
 As noted in the material, nominally these antennas are used for inter -communication. In fact, many of them are easy to adapt for radio interceptions, such as conversations with satellite phones. On the roofs of some embassies, including Warsaw, devices that can listen to mobile communications.
 Such antennas for satellite radio interception and listening to mobile liaison were used by Russian embassies. Many of the 400 Russian diplomats who have been suspected of intelligence, the acquisition in the field of radio communications and computer equipment. Only in Belgium, the first five expelled employees of the embassy had education in branchadio communication or computer technology and served in intelligence. Similar examples of investigators were found in Estonia and Sweden.
 As it is noted, the embassies are monitored not only for special services and political countries, but also for protests against the Kremlin's policy. "When rallies are nearby, Russians can track telephone traffic and collect data and identifiers, such as IMEI numbers of mobile phones," - said Hungarian counterintelligence officer.
 According to him, at least in this country, Russians use this technology full capacity. By checking the interception of electronic communications from the cameras of the embassies, they observe protests and collect information about local critics and Ukrainian groups.According to the expert, it is practically impossible to fight such listening. "In fact, you can't do anything, it is Russian territory. Maximum is to turn off or leave your phone at home if you see that the roof of the Embassy on Baikonur," he advised.
One of the experts told investigators that the equipment of radio electronic intelligence of Russian diplomatic missions is included in the FSB responsibility zone. And the powerful staff serve the equipment, even if the specific task is not the benefits of the CZR or GRU. The FSB technical staff, he said, supports Jesuto intelligence operations.
As reported , the day before in Norway, they stated that 15 Russian diplomats, expelled in the Nanorvegia last week, tried to recruit informants, intercepts messages and buy advanced technologies.
