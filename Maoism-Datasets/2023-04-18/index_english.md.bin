"The helicopter is striking with its reliability, ease of operation and combat," the Borticenter says. According to him, Ukrainian crewed black hawk was extremely fast - in a matter of hours. “Having experienced Mi-8 and Mi-24, on the Black Hawk, we flew on the first day we got. They just sat down and made a flight, ”the pilot says.

According to the defenders, Black Hawk is more maneuverable than Mi-8, much better handling, wins at the speed of horizontal flight. The helicopter is capable of trampling in flight continuously for about three hours, can easily overcome the distance of more than 600 kilometers.

This type of helicopter is designed for firing managed and unmanaged hellfire rocket launchers, as well as designed to maintain infantry and transportation of various cargoes. It takes 3-4 seconds to unload a group of 12 fighters and evacuate another helicopter battlefield.

“Over the last year, the level of our pilots has grown tremendously. Now Ukraine can lightly take about a hundred multi-purpose Blackhawk helicopters, about 50 Apache helicopters, as well as about 40-60 loading helicopters like Chinok. We could take so many changes in the relocation of our pilots, ”assures the first pilot contractor with a maestro call sign.

According to Maestro, this Black Hawk is already actively involved in hostilities, including in the enemy.

-Nowadays, various media and publications are discussing the issue of production of the X-50 missiles by the Russian Federation,-the officer said. -It is not a new project, it was recognized as inappropriate, and instead of these missiles the Russians produced rates of type X-101. Now they are trying to run in production X-50. These missiles can also fly far, affecting different points of Ukraine. However, it is not the fact that the Russian industry is still capable of conducting such a project.

Now, according to Colonel Yuri Ignat, the greatest attention of the enemy is paid to the question of the increase in the use of managed aviation bombs. Moreover, the ultimate publication is actively discussing the possibility of processing all the insecution of aviation bombs from free fall ammunition in managed airplaces. It is not easy to do so in such volumes, because Russia is still in high reserves of Soviet aviation means. It will show how much the Russian "defense" will be able to cope with this task.

While the Russians are increasing the rate of production of unmanned aerial vehicles, because the experience of hostilities has shown the prospects for their use. Some enterprises of the Russian defense industry are even re -profiled by the production of UAV of different types.

Answering the questions of journalists to reduce the intensity of the Iranian Shahaneda's enemy, Colonel Yuriy Ignat noted that, as we know, a week ago, a cargo aircraft from Iran flew to Russia - could just brought a new batch of these barrading ammunition. Therefore, such an increase in hostile activity should be expected. However, not the "shahads" are the only ones. Today, the Russians are increasingly used by percussion UAVs, such as Lancet. Our experts have already developed tactics for counteracting these defeat, and they are increasingly being knocked down by Ukrainian defenders.

The legislation provides for the mandatory selection of biological material of intense services, as well as members of volunteer formations of territorial communities. The procedure for the selection of human genome information has already been developed to implement the relevant law. The document is currently agreed by the central organs of the executive power.

According to this Procedure of human DNA, the military will be digitized and stored in the military. Currently, the appropriate equipment for the selection, digitization and storage of DNA problems has been purchased.

“I wish health, dear Ukrainians!

He started today with a rate meeting. Many questions.

Advanced - the actions of our defense forces, what is possible, and what we have to achieve.

Commanders of the directions - "Khortytsia", "Tavriya", "Odessa", "North" - the Main Commodity - everyone reported about the current situation.

Separately on the rate - supply of ammunition to our soldiers. Today, it was more in detail about this: not only supply, but also all that concerns the production - both the state and private companies. There were reports of the Minister of Research of Strategic Industry Kamyshin, Minister of Defense, Commander of the Gulyak Logistics Forces.

He held a meeting with the head of the Government Shmigal on the results of his trip to Canada Tasadian States, meetings - primarily for the financial support of Ukraine by partners. The results are significant. This also applies to relations with the IMF and other international institutions, bilateral relations with Canada and America.

Thank you to all our partners who invariably help!

By the way, we are already preparing for the next meeting in Ramstein format. Held preparatory meetings. And we expect thorough decisions that will match the vans on the battlefield. Quite ambitious prospects that we all overwhelm. And we bring not only for ourselves, not only for Ukraine, but also for our anti -war coalition.

The aggressor must lose. And this is our joint responsibility with partners - to take more time for peace, that is, to be the most active income of weapons and shells to accelerate our joint victory.

He signed a decree on the awarding of our warriors by the state awards. 127 fighters ... 68 of them are posthumous.

It is very important to understand: every time we hear that the promised supply of weapons is, every time there are doubts about the type of weapons for Ukraine, distinguishing with other qualitative characteristics - every time it means that Ukrainian soldiers give their lives to be this time ... which is spent to convince and to supply the necessary weapons.

I would like to note today to note our soldiers from the 5th Separate Storm Brigade and the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade-for active and successful grave actions in Bakhmut. Thank you to the 214th Rifle Battalion for the powerful blows of the enemy under Bakhmut!Donetsk direction ... fighters of the 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines, the 55th Correct Artillery Brigade. Seventystyevika paratroopers. Warriors of the 74-grade reconnaissance, the 59th separate infantry brigade named after Yakov Gandziuk ... Thank you all!

In Zaporozhye there is something to celebrate the soldiers of the 128th separate assault Transcarpathian Brigade. Well done!

Every destroyed enemy is now a released meter of Ukrainian land tomorrow.

And one more.

Yesterday, a search and rescue operation was completed in Sloviansk after the impact of terrorists on residential buildings. I want to point out our people, the anchor with colleagues on the spot did everything possible… Despite the threat of repeated blows, despite all the difficulties did everything possible to save as much lives as possible.

Thank you to Sergeant Yaroslav Plek, senior sergeant Victor Gergel, senior lelitenant Bohdan Gavrilov and Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Zagnitka, to all who bravden in this operation.

Thank you to everyone and everyone in the Great Collective of the SES of Ukraine who works for the people!

Today, the enemy was emphasized on our losses, including Bakhmut Boyachz and in the suburbs.

▪️ METTER

use an emotionally sensitive topic to:

✔️ to form distrust of military leadership decisions

✔️Wone blame for killed Ukrainians from themselves on us

They and the figures of the fake spread, and our cemeteries showed, and in our words they were told as if we were indifferent to the bodies of the dead.

Another Russian narrative was created.

The fact is that such flashy facts of war cannot be interrupted by a misrepresentation in social networks or media.

The facts are too obvious:

“Each death of Ukrainian military or civilian is a direct consequence

➖ In the enemy there is a choice - it can be taken from our land. We do not have a choice - we misery our state

➖The enemy losses are disorderly higher

Unfortunately, the price of freedom of our country is high - these are the dead heroes. We will finish that they have not had time - we will destroy the enemy and liberate our lands.

Eternal respect and memory of every fallen defender. "

At the same time, the Avdiivsky and Marinsky Napryamka remain very hot. However, despite the high intensity of assault actions, it does not use equipment here. This, according to the chief of the united Press Center of Defense Forces of Tavriysk, is associated not only with weather conditions, but also with problems of logistics.

Commenting on the appearance in the area of responsibility of the so-called assault units of Z, Colonel Alexei Dmitrashkivsky noted that they changed at the positions the units of two airborne regiments, which were significant losses. The infantry of the enemy who are currently on the recovery may not recover from losses. So now, instead of these regular troops, Ukrainian positions storm yesterday's prisoners, which belong not to the Private Naval Company "Wagner", but to Rosarmia.

- It is an army of cowards and Zecs in the literal sense of these words, - the statements, - Shoigu now picks bread from Prigogine, attributing the criminality to the Russian army.

According to Colonel Alexei Dmitrashkivsky, these Z's units have their own -refined recommendations other than Rosarmia's statutes. They got into the hand of Ukrainian defenders together with 15 captured storms. Methods and data obtained from captives indicate a low moral and psychological state in these units. In particular, the disrespectful attitude of the commanders to the subordinates, as well as the name and even imitation of shootings for refusing to participate in the fighting.

“We were struck by the tone of yesterday's press conference of the Minister of Foreign Affairs(Brazil - ed.), who did not match the tone of neutrality and hinted at the fact that the states and Europe _ ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3696326-prezident-brazilii-zaklikav-ssa-pripiniti-zaohocuvati-vijnu-v-ukraini.html)** _ And we think, in fact, that this is a clearly incorrect position, ”the representative of the administration said.

This was stated by the President of the Swiss Confederation Alan Berce during a common German Chancellor Olaf by a Press Conference in Berlin, Correspondenttukinform reports.

“We have decided to support Ukraine in the next years at least 1.8 billion francs, of which 300 million this year ... Switzerland has become very much involved in Ukraine,… in providing humanitarian aid… to… to(plans - ed.)Recovery, ”the President of Switzerland emphasized, mentioning the international conference in Lugano in 2022.

Berce also recalled that Switzerland has joined the EU sanctions, treats them "very seriously and does everything that is possible to actually be realized." But he said, this is a very difficult task because there are "multicators", the exchange of large amounts of information is needed. President [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-svejcaria)At the same time, his country should "adjust some of the moments" that the parliament must approve.

Currently, the Swiss authorities have blocked Russian assets in the amount of € 7.5 billion, which Berce called "a significant amount."

Answering questions about the possibility of transfer of weapons, ammunition to Ukraine, or at least granting permission to other countries to transfer to Vshvazeria military materials, Berse reappeared to the neutrality of his country.

"Neutrality means not providing military support for any party ... We make all parties to comply with the rules and respect international law ... At the same time we cannot violate our own laws, no one can require us," Berse said. At the same time, he did not rule out the continuation of a serious and open discussion on this topic.

The Swiss politician repeated that his country condemned the war and demands the departure of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine.

Scholt confirmed that he had discussed this topic with his guest.

"We know that Ukraine needs help, including weapons and ammunition," the politician stated. He added that in Germany, they closely monitor the very long debates in Switzerland to grant re -export permission and hope for a positive decision.

“We ask the government to check the decision and initiate terminal consultations with the business community and the public. Only through the dialogue it is possible to make more balanced decisions, taking into account the interests of Polish agricultural producers and the dramatic situation in Ukraine, ”the Chamber reads.

** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3697514-eksport-ukrainskoi-agroprodukcii-dozvoliv-strimati-inflaciu-v-es-visockij.html)As it is noted, PUGP appealed to its members to express their thoughts, on the basis of which the minister will be presented with conclusions and recommendations.

"The introduction of a ban on imports of goods was not preceded by consultations, and it hits the Polish entrepreneurs who import products, which is then exported to other markets," - emphasized the PUGP president, former ministry [] [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-polsa)Jacek Naphot.

An example is honey imported from Ukraine and is one of the products specified in the resolution. It is noted that the import of honey from Ukraine to the EU in 2020 amounted to 54.8 thousand tons, in 2021 - 53.8 thousand tons, while in the row this figure fell sharply and amounted to 43.9 thousand tons. As of April 1, 20123, it was 10.5 thousand tons, which is 2.8 thousand tons less than the previous year.

"The key in this context is the fact that honey imports from Russia are not prohibited," the Chamber said in the statement.

Polish entrepreneurs also express concern for the prohibition of the import of soybean in Ukraine, given the significant deficit of this raw material in the Polish market, which was compensated by the import from Ukraine and further processing of the Napolsky market. It is estimated that the scale of imported deliveries is 500,000 tons. The lack of access to this raw material for many plant and soybean feeds and products will mean that the production cyl will be stopped. It is emphasized that unilateral actions on trade from the EU Member of the EU must receive a response from the European Commission.

"Problems that have not been noticed before, today mean disproportionate solutions. We urge the government for subject consultations.

“Some projects, such as the development of the Road Code, were made without clear payment obligations. As a result, in fact, it happened, and we did not receive payments for these.

“The propagandist Keoosyan stated that with the phrase of the“ brotherly people ”about the Ukrainians to“ tie ”. She seems to confuse people.

He also added that the Russians were fighting in the fields of "their" Ukraine with "Ecumenical Evil".

In these words, Keosan destroyed the long -standing narrative of Rospropaganda about the "brother -in -law of Ukraine".

The disgraced propagandist also began to justify the murders of peaceful Ukrainian terrorists of the Wagner PEC, although earlier all Putin media stated that Russian was not able to commit such crimes

The birth of new narratives indicates that all the previous ones are not justified by the Kremlin. Also, it is likely to be evidence that Russia is trying to create a new occasion for large -scale mobilization of Russia. "

“This is another clear signal of unchanged support from the US. Launching this international center is an important prerequisite for creating a special tidus for a crime of aggression, ”he added.

At the same time, as [reported](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-following-meeting-ukrainian-prosecutor-general-andriy)In the press service of the US Ministry of Justice, the prosecutor will be based on the HAZEV Euras - the Agency of the European Union for cooperation in the field of justice.

The Ministry of Justice also plans to send a permanent legal advisor to the US Embassy in Kiev this summer. This adviser will work with Ukrainian partners on a number of difficult issues of the justice sector.

Prosecutors who work with a group of investigation of the US Department of Justice, continue to cooperate closely with colleagues at the Office Prosecutor of Ukraine to investigate specific crimes committed by Russian troops, including illegal attacks on civilians.

The US Congress has recently expanded the powers of the Ministry of Justice on judicial reversal of likely war criminals, which were found in the United States. This means that in the coming years and decades, Russian warriors who have been in the United States should expect that they will find themselves in the USA.

In addition, the US Ministry of Justice applies new powers given to the US Congress to transfer certain assets that have confiscated from Russian oligarchs to use Ukraine.

“We will do our best to help Ukraine achieve justice for their people. And we will work as much as we need to be held responsible for those who are responsible for the cruel crimes of the Russian regime, ”said US Attorney General Merrick Garland.

According to Ukrinform, this is stated in the investigation [](https://fsb.dossier.center/antenna/).

It is noted that most of these antennas are installed on the building [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-posolstvo)The Russian Federation in Brussels is 17. At the Dakhakh Russian embassies in Madrid, Belgrade, Lisbon, Sofia and Nicosia, 10 of them are 10 and more. In total, at least 182 antennas have been drawn up on 39 Russian embassies and consulates in Europe. However, as the investigators point out, not all of them are externally, so their real number is probably even greater.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-19T-31-13-00-03-00/1681823878-697.jpg)As noted in the material, nominally these antennas are used for inter -communication. In fact, many of them are easy to adapt for radio interceptions, such as conversations with satellite phones. On the roofs of some embassies, including Warsaw, devices that can listen to mobile communications.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-19T-31-13-00-03-00/1681823878-594.jpg)Such antennas for satellite radio interception and listening to mobile liaison were used by Russian embassies. Many of the 400 Russian diplomats who have been suspected of intelligence, the acquisition in the field of radio communications and computer equipment. Only in Belgium, the first five expelled employees of the embassy had education in branchadio communication or computer technology and served in intelligence. Similar examples of investigators were found in Estonia and Sweden.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-19T-31-13-00-03-00/1681823878-738.jpg)As it is noted, the embassies are monitored not only for special services and political countries, but also for protests against the Kremlin's policy. "When rallies are nearby, Russians can track telephone traffic and collect data and identifiers, such as IMEI numbers of mobile phones," - said Hungarian counterintelligence officer.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-19T-31-13-00-03-00/1681823878-119.jpg)According to him, at least in this country, Russians use this technology full capacity. By checking the interception of electronic communications from the cameras of the embassies, they observe protests and collect information about local critics and Ukrainian groups.According to the expert, it is practically impossible to fight such listening. "In fact, you can't do anything, it is Russian territory. Maximum is to turn off or leave your phone at home if you see that the roof of the Embassy on Baikonur," he advised.

One of the experts told investigators that the equipment of radio electronic intelligence of Russian diplomatic missions is included in the FSB responsibility zone. And the powerful staff serve the equipment, even if the specific task is not the benefits of the CZR or GRU. The FSB technical staff, he said, supports Jesuto intelligence operations.
