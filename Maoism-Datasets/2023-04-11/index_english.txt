 About it told Secretaries of National Security and Defense Alexey Danilov during the discussion "Ukraine before the face of external challenges".
He is convinced that Russia's fragmentation has already begun, and the decision of a full -scale invasion of February 24, 2022 only accelerated this process.
“This fragmentation occurs regardless of the desire of some countries, including Western countries. Everything will start with the Caucasus. And it will continue or not, it depends on us, ”the NSDC secretary emphasized.
If the fragmentation process does not complete, the issue of stability of Ukraine will constantly interrupt on the agenda.
“The country that is in the risk zone does not attract investors. It is not necessary to vitrate that money will be used, regardless of the safety situation. There is a great deal of countries in the world where you can invest without risk. Therefore, if we are not abandoned by Russia's issues, then all other issues will be extremely difficult for us, ”Alexei Danilov said.
In his opinion, new unions and tasks of Ukraine will be formed in the world and the region to make them protect themselves from Russia with their help.
The NSDC Secretary also shared a forecast for the development of the world. The National Security Council has developed five basic scenarios, among them:
1 . revival of democracies and a one -pole world accompanied by the United States
2 . a variable world under the influence of China
3 . a two -pole world in which the US and China will rule
4 . Multipolar world, or the world fragmented into several economic and safety blocks
5 . EU and China coalition that will have the greatest impact
Alexei Danilov is convinced that the most likely is the scenario of the transition of the additive world, or the competitive coexistence of the two countries.

Despite the fact that the army of the Russian Federation is fighting along the entire front line, its advancement is approaching the climax, so the occupiers use artillery to compensate for reduced offensive potential.
About it in your report reports the Institute of War Study(Isw).
Зазначається, що 8 квітня голова Ради резервістів Сухопутних військ УкраїниІван Тимочко повідомив, що російські війська ведуть бої на всій лінії фронту,але наступальний потенціал росії продовжує знижуватися і що нинішні російськіатаки спрямовані на відволікання і розпорошення українських військ вочікуванні контрнаступальних операцій.
Також повідомляється, що Іван Тимочко оцінив атаки рф, зокрема в районіБахмута та Авдіївки. Зазначається, що за його словами російські війська недосягають серйозних успіхів на жодній ділянці фронту, зазначивши, що темпиобстрілів у Бахмуті та навколо нього дещо знизилися на одних ділянках, а наінших — повністю зупинилися.
А російський наступ на Авдіївку, за оцінкою Тимочка — «захлинувся». Вінпідкреслив, що рф досі не взяла під контроль Мар’їнку, незважаючи на те, щоперетворила місто на руїни.
Водночас російські війська використовують артилерію, щоб компенсувати зниженийнаступальний потенціал, повідомляють в ISW.
Аналітики вважають, що високий попит на снаряди свідчить, що росія значноюмірою покладається на артилерію, щоб компенсувати ключові недоліки в бойовійспроможності, зокрема погані навички наземного штурму та недоступність авіаціїв Україні.
російські війська використовують важкі артилерійські обстріли, щоб повністюзруйнувати населені пункти, перш ніж захопити їх наземними атаками.
«Триваючий дефіцит артилерійських боєприпасів у росії підірве здатністьросійських військових продовжувати компенсувати інші свої недоліки таобмеження», — йдеться у зведенні.

He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.
They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.
There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.
The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.
SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.
We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.
Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.
We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.
As before, our positions on the front, all our warriors in positions must support Ukrainian positions politically and informally, with the power of weapons by the tribal of our social unity, our inner stability and strength of Ukraine with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state and all the states, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value free life and international rule based on rules.
It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Today I had a very interesting, meaningful meeting with the American Businessman and Philanthropist Howard Buffette. It has long and generously helping Ukraine, our people. Many of the projects are being implemented with its support. For example, the construction of a kitchen factory has begun in Bucha, which will become part of a reform of school nutrition in Ukraine and will provide children in three communities of Kyiv region. This project will also be scaled to different riregions, in particular in Kharkiv region.
And when a person helps when he personally cares for support - which is a total of hundreds of millions of dollars in general - then such a person sees very well, how important everyone to be on the way to victory, how important everyone is active, as important to all become a hero to something in something. To win we all.
I thank you for the support of Mr. Buffett. Thank you to all our partners in the world, who non -traffic in help.
I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.
_ Glory to all our soldiers!_ 
_ Glory to our strong people!_ 
Glory to Ukraine!

 We are contagious about this stage of war, when it is important to both our society and partners of the defect of the path we have to go.
About it in your The president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said, Ukrinform reports.
Viso: 
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.
They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.
There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.
The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.
SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.
We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.
Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.
We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.
As before, our positions on the front, all our warriors in positions must support Ukrainian positions politically and informally, with the power of weapons by the tribal of our social unity, our inner stability and strength of Ukraine with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state and all the states, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value free life and international rule based on rules.
It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Today I had a very interesting, meaningful meeting with the American Businessman and Philanthropist Howard Buffette. It has long and generously helping Ukraine, our people. Many of the projects are being implemented with its support. For example, the construction of a kitchen factory has begun in Bucha, which will become part of a reform of school nutrition in Ukraine and will provide children in three communities of Kyiv region. This project will also be scaled to different riregions, in particular in Kharkiv region.
And when a person helps when he personally cares for support - which is a total of hundreds of millions of dollars in general - then such a person sees very well, how important everyone to be on the way to victory, how important everyone is active, as important to all become a hero to something in something. To win we all.
I thank you for the support of Mr. Buffett. Thank you to all our partners in the world, who non -traffic in help.
I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.
_ Glory to all our soldiers!_ 
_ Glory to our strong people!_ 
Glory to Ukraine!

 Center for Combating Misinformation in NSDC Ukraine Publicated The main narrative that was promoted by the Russian media.
“Russia is on the side of light. And this can be easily proved, because Russia does not seek to be richer, does not seek to capture other countries, does not seek to subdue someone, ”Kirill Gundyaev said boldly.
Gundyayev's cynical statement was supplemented by the words that the war in Ukraine was the "cemetery of God" and only Russia found the strength to withstand evil.
Also, according to Moscow Pop, the reason for the war in Ukraine was the non -imperial desires of Putin, and the conflict of the West and Russia against the background of the absence of "common Christian values".
The statements of religious leaders are aimed at heating the internal conflict in Ukraine against the background of the transition to the PCU.
"Reconciling the war with religion, the Kremlin tries to justify their crimes and unite the Russians around the" Holy War ", which, in their opinion, should contribute to voluntary mobilization," the statement said.

 Polish Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Shchersky to the Russian security council on the Reds of Range through the supply of weapons to Ukraine compared Rosarmia's crimes in Bucha and Irpeniz with a Katyn tragedy and a disaster aircraft near the Russian Smolensk.
This is stated in message Poland's representations to the UN.
“Every year in the first days of April we honor one of the most tragic clergymen of Poland - Katyn Shot .У 1940 році за таємним наказом йосипа сталіна нквс (Soviet secret police),здійснила серію масових страт майже 22 000 польських офіцерів та представниківінтелігенції — військовополонених. Це сталося лише через кілька місяців післятого, як сталінська червона армія приєдналася до гітлерівського Вермахту підчас військового вторгнення до Польщі, що фактично почало Другу світову війну.Польських військовополонених зі зв’язаними руками розстрілювали в потилицю, апотім кидали в ями безіменних братських могил. Один за одним, двадцять двітисячі разів. Тож не дивуйтеся, що фотографії минулорічних подій у Бучі таІрпені повернули ці жахливі спогади з нашого власного минулого», — зазначивКшиштоф Щерський.
Він процитував пророчі слова, сказані польським президентом Лехом Качиньським,який загинув під російським смоленськом у 2010 році під час візиту длявшанування пам'яті польських офіцерів-жертв розстрілів нквс у Катині:
«росія вірить, що повертаються колишні часи імперії, яка розвалилася менше 20років тому. Що знову домінування буде характерною рисою цього регіону. Алецього не буде», — резюмував постійний представник Польщі в ООН.

Наступного дня, 6 березня 2022 року, о 07:30 цивільні жителі м. Ірпіньспробували евакуюватися з міста на власних автомобілях. Люди наклеїли на нихлисти з написами «ДІТИ» та «ЕВАКУАЦІЯ», щоб позначити, що це саме цивільнітранспортні засоби.
Колона рухалася по вулиці Незалежності та повернула на вулицю Олега Кошового унапрямку Житомирської траси.

«Під виглядом проведення стратегічного командно-штабного навчання рф здійснилапідготовку та розпочала широкомасштабну збройну агресію з метою знищення нашоїдержави. Початковий план захоплення Києва був розрахований на короткостроковуоперацію тривалістю в 3-5 діб. Подібний план був використаний СРСР в Угорщинів 1956-му, Чехословаччині в 1968-му та в Афганістані у 1979 році», — повідомиввін.
За його словами, окупанти за звичним для себе принципом планували щонайшвидшевисадити ССО і повітряні десанти на аеродромах Гостомель і Васильків.
«Ракетними та авіаційними ударами — знищити нашу систему ППО, пунктиуправління військових частин ЗСУ та Національної гвардії, обʼєкти критичноїінфраструктури.
Далі, за умов дезорганізації і краху системи управління, — захопити урядовийквартал та встановити свій маріонеточний уряд. Наміри противника було вщентрозбито Силами оборони, як і всі подальші спроби зміни тактики наступу. Ворогнедооцінив наших громадян, і зрештою – був змушений стрімголов тікати», —зазначив Олександр Павлюк.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy applied To the Ukrainians on the 412nd Defense Day:
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.
They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.
There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.
The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.
SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.
We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.
Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.
We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.
As before, our positions at the front, all our warriors in positions are supported by Ukrainian positions politically and informally, forces and power and the power of our social unity, our inner stability of Ukraine's tamitivity with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state, so Ivsih in the state, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value the free life of an international order based on the rules.
It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Thank you to all our partners in the world who does not keep the activity in help.
I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.
_ Glory to all our soldiers!_ 
_ Glory to our strong people!_ 
Glory to Ukraine!
