He is convinced that Russia's fragmentation has already begun, and the decision of a full -scale invasion of February 24, 2022 only accelerated this process.

“This fragmentation occurs regardless of the desire of some countries, including Western countries. Everything will start with the Caucasus. And it will continue or not, it depends on us, ”the NSDC secretary emphasized.

If the fragmentation process does not complete, the issue of stability of Ukraine will constantly interrupt on the agenda.

“The country that is in the risk zone does not attract investors. It is not necessary to vitrate that money will be used, regardless of the safety situation. There is a great deal of countries in the world where you can invest without risk. Therefore, if we are not abandoned by Russia's issues, then all other issues will be extremely difficult for us, ”Alexei Danilov said.

In his opinion, new unions and tasks of Ukraine will be formed in the world and the region to make them protect themselves from Russia with their help.

The NSDC Secretary also shared a forecast for the development of the world. The National Security Council has developed five basic scenarios, among them:

1 \. revival of democracies and a one -pole world accompanied by the United States

2 \. a variable world under the influence of China

3 \. a two -pole world in which the US and China will rule

4 \. Multipolar world, or the world fragmented into several economic and safety blocks

Despite the fact that the army of the Russian Federation is fighting along the entire front line, its advancement is approaching the climax, so the occupiers use artillery to compensate for reduced offensive potential.

About it in your [report](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-8-2023)reports the Institute of War Study(Isw).

Зазначається, що 8 квітня голова Ради резервістів Сухопутних військ УкраїниІван Тимочко повідомив, що російські війська ведуть бої на всій лінії фронту,але наступальний потенціал росії продовжує знижуватися і що нинішні російськіатаки спрямовані на відволікання і розпорошення українських військ вочікуванні контрнаступальних операцій.

Також повідомляється, що Іван Тимочко оцінив атаки рф, зокрема в районіБахмута та Авдіївки. Зазначається, що за його словами російські війська недосягають серйозних успіхів на жодній ділянці фронту, зазначивши, що темпиобстрілів у Бахмуті та навколо нього дещо знизилися на одних ділянках, а наінших — повністю зупинилися.

А російський наступ на Авдіївку, за оцінкою Тимочка — «захлинувся». Вінпідкреслив, що рф досі не взяла під контроль Мар’їнку, незважаючи на те, щоперетворила місто на руїни.

Водночас російські війська використовують артилерію, щоб компенсувати зниженийнаступальний потенціал, повідомляють в ISW.

Аналітики вважають, що високий попит на снаряди свідчить, що росія значноюмірою покладається на артилерію, щоб компенсувати ключові недоліки в бойовійспроможності, зокрема погані навички наземного штурму та недоступність авіаціїв Україні.

російські війська використовують важкі артилерійські обстріли, щоб повністюзруйнувати населені пункти, перш ніж захопити їх наземними атаками.

«Триваючий дефіцит артилерійських боєприпасів у росії підірве здатністьросійських військових продовжувати компенсувати інші свої недоліки таобмеження», — йдеться у зведенні.

About it in your [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEPIZl8KcH8)The president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said, Ukrinform reports.

_Viso: [](https://t.me/OP_UA/9212)_

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.

They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.

There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.

The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.

SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.

We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.

Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.

We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.

As before, our positions on the front, all our warriors in positions must support Ukrainian positions politically and informally, with the power of weapons by the tribal of our social unity, our inner stability and strength of Ukraine with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state and all the states, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value free life and international rule based on rules.

It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Today I had a very interesting, meaningful meeting with the American Businessman and Philanthropist Howard Buffette. It has long and generously helping Ukraine, our people. Many of the projects are being implemented with its support. For example, the construction of a kitchen factory has begun in Bucha, which will become part of a reform of school nutrition in Ukraine and will provide children in three communities of Kyiv region. This project will also be scaled to different riregions, in particular in Kharkiv region.

And when a person helps when he personally cares for support - which is a total of hundreds of millions of dollars in general - then such a person sees very well, how important everyone to be on the way to victory, how important everyone is active, as important to all become a hero to something in something. To win we all.

I thank you for the support of Mr. Buffett. Thank you to all our partners in the world, who non -traffic in help.

I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.

** _ Glory to all our soldiers!_ **

** _ Glory to our strong people!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-11T-8-54-00-03-00/630_360_1668516893-852.jpg)The Presidential Council, Charles Michel, believes that European leaders are becoming more and more involved in the desire of French President Emmanuel Macron to "strategic autonomy" from the United States.

Michel said this in an interview with the French TV show La Faute à L'Erope, Ukrinform reports, citing "[](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2023/04/11/7159637/)".

The leader of the Euro Council suggested that the position of the French leader is not an isolated GPU, and although Macron acted as a President of France, his views reflect increasing changes among European leaders.

"There was a jump forward on strategic autonomy, compared to it, which was a few years ago," Michelle said.

"As for the issue of relations with the United States, it is clear that there may be nuances and delicate issues in the European Council. , He added.

The President of the European Council noted that he supports the development of closer EU and the United States, but not if this process stipulates that "we are blindly, will systematically follow the positions of the United States on all issues."

Recall: French President Emmanuel Macron, after returning from a three -day visit to the PRC, stated that Europe is not interested in the escalation of Kryzanvko Taiwan and should adhere to his own strategy in a relationship of a system, independent of both the United States and China.

Politicians of Germany and the Czech Republic have criticized statements ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-makron)** On Taiwan, as well as the dependence of Europe on the United States.

The Head of the Polish Government Mateusz Moravetsky warned individual European leaders against attempting to promote the policy of "strategic autonomy" in Europe, calling, on the contrary, to the development of Europe's strategic cooperation with a diversion.

She told this exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.

“Thomas Bach shows that he has opened the door in order to return the Russian and Belarusian athletes to the world arena is what he or she has in world sports. We see that more and more federations allow these athletes to participate in competitions. Honestly, I don't know what they think. A year ago, Thomas Bach said that we are solidarity with you, that people are killed in Ukraine. In a year we have lost even more people, we see destroyed infrastructure, and solidarity went somewhere ... They are conditionally solidarity with us, but allow ourselves to do it, do it. The other day, I returned from Donetsk, I was under the time ravine. I saw how the cities are destroying and wrote the post: please come and see what's going on. Our athletes instead of trophy, protect their home country, stand and die for their home. I am scattered Thomas Bach to hear our athletes, ”Saladukha said.

In addition, the former World Champion in a triple jump stressed that the Mipovin is possible to make Russian and Belarussian athletes prevent international competitions, including the Olympic Games.

“The government is now forbidding our athletes to compete in competitions where Russians and Belarus will be released. We need to do everything possible to prevent these athletes, so that our athletes can go, speak to rise in our craft, heard the anthem and hear about our country. The work of the Minister, the Presidential Olympic Committee continues. Recently, there was a meeting of the World Commission of Athlets. We told about our pain there. As a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, I appealed to Thomas Bach from the Committee on the prevention of Russian Tabilor's athletes for international competitions. He says he hears us, but they tell our athletes that if the government does not allow you to do a permit, then the IOC will support you, you will be able to perform in competitions. I even miss out how it will happen, ”Saladukha said.

She also emphasized that Ukrainian athletes now do not understand what to do, because in the future Russians and Belarusians can allow competitions.The IOC recently published recommendations for international federations on the admission of Russians and Belarus to international competitions in neutral status without national symbols.

About it reports [](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-starts-fuel-supplies-iran-by-rail-sources-2023-04-11/)With reference to three sectoral sets and export data, Ukrinform reports.

According to sources, last fall, the Viceremier-Minister of the Russian Federation Alexander Novokalokua about the beginning of swap stations [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nafta)Burning, but the actual deliveries began only this year.

In February and March, Russia put up to 30,000 tons of idyzel fuel gasoline in Iran, two knowledgeable sources reported Reuters. The third source confirmed the fact of trade, but could not confirm the volume.

All volumes were delivered by rail from Russia through Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. One source reported that some gasoline parties were sent from Iran to the neighboring countries, in particular to Iraq, by trucks.

Iran is an oil manufacturer and has its own refinery, but recently its consumption exceeds the internal production of fuel, especially the provinces.

Russia supplied small amounts of fuel to Iran's tankers through Caspian, as it was in 2018, two traders said.

Russian oil companies are currently interested in the export of ibenzine diesel fuel to Iran by rail, as by sea transport is faced with high freight rates and pricing restrictions established by G7 countries.

As it is noted, within the Black Sea initiative, representatives of the Russian Federation, Turkey and the UN inspect ships on the way to and from Ukrainian ports. The joint commission coordinates the names of the ships to be inspected. However, Vaskov's establishments, no checks occurred on Tuesday.

The Ukrainian side gave the names of three dry loads, as provided by the agreement. But the Russians crossed out these names and submitted other vessels from the current queue, which is analyzed by 50 ships. As a result, no vessel has been able to continue their own, which is the actual blockade by Moscow.

About it in your [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEPIZl8KcH8)The president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said, Ukrinform reports.

_Viso: [](https://t.me/OP_UA/9212)_

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.

They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.

There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.

The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.

SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.

We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.

Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.

We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.

As before, our positions on the front, all our warriors in positions must support Ukrainian positions politically and informally, with the power of weapons by the tribal of our social unity, our inner stability and strength of Ukraine with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state and all the states, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value free life and international rule based on rules.

It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Today I had a very interesting, meaningful meeting with the American Businessman and Philanthropist Howard Buffette. It has long and generously helping Ukraine, our people. Many of the projects are being implemented with its support. For example, the construction of a kitchen factory has begun in Bucha, which will become part of a reform of school nutrition in Ukraine and will provide children in three communities of Kyiv region.

The leader of the Euro Council suggested that the position of the French leader is not an isolated GPU, and although Macron acted as a President of France, his views reflect increasing changes among European leaders.

"There was a jump forward on strategic autonomy, compared to it, which was a few years ago," Michelle said.

He noted that the process would consist of several differenties.

- Audit of earth and water will be made after the de -occupation. Today, there are situations where even sea mines fall on the beach, and not only Ukrainian. The second is mine equipment. It is not only identification, installation and fixation, but also the possibility of exchanging elements. And the Kingdom of Denmark can help us in this, - he explains.

According to him, Denmark has specialized drones - submarines that have sessers that are able to detect, record and transmit coordinates to the sappers, which can carry out sapper work underwater. In Ukraine, since 2014, the company has been operating, which is represented by the Kingdom of Denmark. This company has great possible expertise to carry out humanitarian demining, that is, the change in areas that are not in the war zone.

Another institution of demining in Ukraine is the SES. They are interested in the demining of civilian infrastructure.

- The SES is a leader in demining, but they do prompt mine. But this is an operational mine. And the full -scale alteration of the same agrarian sector, when our farmers begging: "Might the pole so that we can sow and grow food" is a huge task, "the minister said.

There is currently an interagency group headed by Yulia Sviridenko, the First Viceremian and the Minister of Economy. It, as an economist, understands which industries are epiorities in this matter. And the experience of the Kingdom of Denmark will be indispensable for the effective work of our sappers.

- In our plans to create our own potential of at least 5 thousand Ukrainian persons who will be demining. And this is the calculation that the experts from other countries will also be involved, - said Alexei Reznikov.- In Croatia, the war ended 28 years ago. By this time, Croatia's territory is not fully unchanged. That is, the Croatian National Center still has a job. They can on average up to 50 square kilometers of land, including rough terrain - rocks, forest huts, etc. - summed up Rennikov.

“Russia is on the side of light. And this can be easily proved, because Russia does not seek to be richer, does not seek to capture other countries, does not seek to subdue someone, ”Kirill Gundyaev said boldly.

Gundyayev's cynical statement was supplemented by the words that the war in Ukraine was the "cemetery of God" and only Russia found the strength to withstand evil.

Also, according to Moscow Pop, the reason for the war in Ukraine was the non -imperial desires of Putin, and the conflict of the West and Russia against the background of the absence of "common Christian values".

The statements of religious leaders are aimed at heating the internal conflict in Ukraine against the background of the transition to the PCU.

"Reconciling the war with religion, the Kremlin tries to justify their crimes and unite the Russians around the" Holy War ", which, in their opinion, should contribute to voluntary mobilization," the statement said.

Це сталося лише через кілька місяців післятого, як сталінська червона армія приєдналася до гітлерівського Вермахту підчас військового вторгнення до Польщі, що фактично почало Другу світову війну.Польських військовополонених зі зв’язаними руками розстрілювали в потилицю, апотім кидали в ями безіменних братських могил. Один за одним, двадцять двітисячі разів. Тож не дивуйтеся, що фотографії минулорічних подій у Бучі таІрпені повернули ці жахливі спогади з нашого власного минулого», — зазначивКшиштоф Щерський.

Він процитував пророчі слова, сказані польським президентом Лехом Качиньським,який загинув під російським смоленськом у 2010 році під час візиту длявшанування пам'яті польських офіцерів-жертв розстрілів нквс у Катині:

«росія вірить, що повертаються колишні часи імперії, яка розвалилася менше 20років тому. Що знову домінування буде характерною рисою цього регіону. Алецього не буде», — резюмував постійний представник Польщі в ООН.

Розслідуванням встановлено, що 5 березня 2022 року російські військові 173-гоокремого розвідувального батальйону та 137-го гвардійського парашутно-десантного полку захопили будівлю в м. Ірпіні по вул. Федора Кричевського.Вони перевіряли людей на блокпосту на виїзді з міста.

Захопивши об’єкти, окупанти встановили вогневий контроль над проїжджоючастиною вул Олега Кошового. На той час це була єдина дорога, якою можна булоевакуюватися на транспорті з міста.

Наступного дня, 6 березня 2022 року, о 07:30 цивільні жителі м. Ірпіньспробували евакуюватися з міста на власних автомобілях. Люди наклеїли на нихлисти з написами «ДІТИ» та «ЕВАКУАЦІЯ», щоб позначити, що це саме цивільнітранспортні засоби.

Колона рухалася по вулиці Незалежності та повернула на вулицю Олега Кошового унапрямку Житомирської траси. Коли автомобілі доїхали до ЖК «Кошовий» по них ізгранатометів та стрілецької зброї відкрили вогонь російські військові. Врезультаті обстрілу шести автівок загинуло п’ять осіб та ще сім, у тому числімалолітня дитина, отримали поранення різного ступеню тяжкості.

Окупанти жорстоко ставилися до поранених та не давали можливості надати їмдопомогу.

За його словами, окупанти за звичним для себе принципом планували щонайшвидшевисадити ССО і повітряні десанти на аеродромах Гостомель і Васильків.

«Ракетними та авіаційними ударами — знищити нашу систему ППО, пунктиуправління військових частин ЗСУ та Національної гвардії, обʼєкти критичноїінфраструктури.

Далі, за умов дезорганізації і краху системи управління, — захопити урядовийквартал та встановити свій маріонеточний уряд. Наміри противника було вщентрозбито Силами оборони, як і всі подальші спроби зміни тактики наступу. Ворогнедооцінив наших громадян, і зрештою – був змушений стрімголов тікати», —зазначив Олександр Павлюк.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.

They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.

There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.

The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.

SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.

We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.

Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.

We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.

As before, our positions at the front, all our warriors in positions are supported by Ukrainian positions politically and informally, forces and power and the power of our social unity, our inner stability of Ukraine's tamitivity with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state, so Ivsih in the state, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value the free life of an international order based on the rules.

It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Thank you to all our partners in the world who does not keep the activity in help.

I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.

** _ Glory to all our soldiers!_ **

** _ Glory to our strong people!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**
