In a conversation with his associate with his associate, a serviceman of the Russian Federation told about the impressiveness of the dead, which everyone is silent:

· The occupier is shared by advice on how to avoid mobilization - through divorce to a friend and the registration of care over the child;

· “We do not pass any communion? NO, I did not pass them*;

· "C*ka, cogd Bahkaet, even squeeze";

"For every military crime committed against Ukraine, there will be a valid payment," the military intelligence officers say.

About it on your Facebook page [writes](https://www.facebook.com/StratcomCentreUA/posts/pfbid0CedsgKQwqktTgzPRiKaQHCoqsdWkc13QvNbhY5sAUBPEU7ipX5xSNnEHW7oUvD7Sl)Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security.

There is also an interesting history with the prevention of the UN to the flooded territories of the occupied Kherson region. Gennady Gatilov, Post-Russian Post-income Headquarters of the UN, stressed that the organization "should not ignore the fact that the Kherson region is part of the Russian Federation, and accordingly, for its certification it is necessary to comply with Russian laws."

Peskov, in turn, put the usual smoke, saying that the Uonians were not allowed to the affected areas through shelling.

In fact, the coordinator of the UN Special Humanities Mission from Ukraine Denizbraun has issued a statement stating that Moscow refuses to organize admission to the left bank under the control of Russia.

Moscow may not like the definition of the UN: "Territories that are underwenting in Russia"(that is quite obvious because the international community does not recognize their "accession"). Тому росія пішла на принцип і не пустилагуманітарну місію, прикриваючись «турботою про її безпеку».

Зараз в українському місті Гола Пристань окупаційна влада оголосила карантин.Тобто нічого нового не відбувається. путін, як і раніше, нехтує життям людейзаради власних цілей. Є що приховувати і кого ховати?

The appropriate decision was [made](https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/111536574)The Supreme Court is a complication of the court chamber for the protection(Case No. 560/8064/22).

Так, вищезгадана колегія суддів, переглядаючи таку справу в касаційномупорядку відносно ветерана війни — особи з інвалідністю ІІ групи внаслідоквійни, дійшла висновку, що положення статті 13 Закону України «Про статусветеранів війни, гарантії їх соціального захисту» необхідно застосовувати щодовиплати у розмірі 8 мінімальних пенсій за віком для даної категорії ветеранів.

Судова палата під час ухвалення рішення звернула увагу на те, що реалізаціяправа на соціальний захист осіб, які перебувають на службі у ЗСУ та іншихвійськових формуваннях, а також членів їхніх сімей потребує запровадженнямеханізмів забезпечення їх державної підтримки. При цьому головну роль вобороні України відіграють саме Збройні Сили України та інші військовіформування, які своєю мужньою боротьбою здійснюють ефективний захистУкраїнської держави та Українського народу. Відтак усебічна підтримкавійськовослужбовців та ветеранів війни є найвищим державним інтересом і однієюз найбільш захищених конституційних цінностей України.

Відповідна постанова суду касаційної інстанції набирає законної сили з дати їїухвалення та не може бути оскаржена.

Раніше Велика Палата Верховного Суду вже розглядала аналогічну справу щодовиплати одноразової грошової допомоги до 5 травня за 2020 рік. Під часрозгляду судді акцентували увагу на тому, що на момент отримання спірноїразової грошової допомоги до 5 травня слід керуватися вимогами Закону України«Про статус ветеранів війни, гарантії їх соціального захисту», що передбачаєвиплату такої допомоги для учасників бойових дій у розмірі 5 мінімальнихпенсій за віком, інвалідам війни 1 групи — 10 мінімальних пенсій за віком, 2групи — 8 мінімальних пенсій за віком, 3 групи — 7 мінімальних пенсій завіком.

Отже, цьогорічним рішенням Верховний Суд підтвердив те, що одноразова грошовадопомога до 5 травня за 2022 рік повинна виплачуватися відповідно до розмірівмінімальних пенсій за віком, навіть в умовах воєнного стану.

In particular, Kosovo should immediately stop a police operation near municipal buildings in northern Kosovo, and allow four mayors to perform their duties with the margins of these municipal buildings. In turn, Serbia should provide all participants in protests from the municipal buildings where they know, at the same time as Kosovo's police are allocated.

This was stated by the President of the Czech Republic Peter Pavel at the International Conference "Media and Ukraine", which is conducted by Czech Radio on June 22, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"It is quite logical that… if the conditions that were used at the initial stage, across the half of the year have changed, then the rules must be reworked," - commented the Pavel Document of Lex Ukraine Vina V, which he signed in the spring.

He called it clear and fair that if one of the refugees found a work, integrated into society, sent children to school, leads such as citizens of the Czech Republic, then the conditions provided by the Czech authorities should be not allowed for those who apply to their own citizens.

About it at the Media Center Ukraine-Ukrinform during a briefing on the topic: "From Bryanskado Irkutsk: what happens to Ukrainian prisoners on the walls of Russian prisoners" said coordinator MIPP Tatiana Katrychenko.

“The Russian Federation now continues to use the places of detention in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don, but they have still been added a huge number of places where citizens of both civilians and servicemen are being held. This is a huge number of citizens - it is about thousands - which have been moved to the territory of the Russian Federation and, obviously, that the Russian Federation lacks places for their maintenance, ” - reported.

She noted that the topic of keeping, moving the prisoners of war is not researched, as it is often very scary. MIPP investigated the places of maintenance in the occupied territories until February 24, 2022. And if the MIPP knows about every location of prisoners of war by the occupied territories of Ukraine, then it is extremely difficult to obtain information in the Russian Federation, it is now collected, based on the testimony of released military -war.

According to the participants of the event, from February 24, 2022 and until June 15, 2023, MIMPP interviewed more than 50 servicemen released during the exchanges(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-poloneni). Analyzing the selected testimony, MIPP saw the systematic politicians and methods of treatment of Ukrainian prisoners used by Rossi. They are common to all places - physical and moral torture, poor and poor nutrition, practically lack of medical care.

All the evidence of the former prisoners is combined by the fact of systematic application of Ukrainian military physical and psychological violence. This is happening around the clock. The intensity of beating increases when eating, visiting shower and checking cameras. There are cases of torture during interrogations, the initiators of the study reported.

Also, according to Katrychenko, if prisoners have injuries or serious chronic domains, he usually does not receive medical care. Almost everyone who was in the afternoon and whom the MIP representatives interviewed claim that the request for medical assistance is ends with beating.

Often, the food is given for 2-3 minutes, and the extremely low quality of nutrition will be given to the fact that most of the released have critical weight loss-from 10 to 30 kg.

MIPP also known cases of captivity. The military reported however that they have seen or heard about the facts of the death of servicemen.

Imp representatives paid special attention to the frequent movements of the erection between different places of maintenance in the Russian Federation. This is how the person is hidden, to confuse his search, and so that the warriors could not subsequently identify the staff involved in the dosage over them. Even the information is carefully hidden from the prisoners of war in which area they were.

Based on the survey of released servicemen, the MIPP has collected about most well -known maintenance sites in the Russian Federation and an interactive map.

Human Media Initiative(Mplex)- is a media team that changes the external and domestic policy to integrate Ukraine into the free world. The main inquiries of MIPP activity: investigation of war crimes committed in connection with the Rabbit Aggression in Ukraine, in particular violent disappearances, deportations and hostages, improper maintenance of prisoners of war, tracking of lawsuits of Ukraine; Analytics of practices, which are implemented by the Russian Federation; Advocacy in the policies of public practices to ensure and respect for human rights and freedoms.

Pavel noted that the war is not only physically but also in the media space, for the minds and thoughts of people. But there is also a battle for partners, the politician added. He recalled that Putin's propaganda had long prepared their social for war, forced the Russians to believe in the existence of a threat to the Russian Federation, Avidak and the right to "defend", to believe that there is no sovereign Ukraine.

Russia also manipulated the measure, conducting misinformation campaigns; The west in the West still believe in Putin propaganda. Such people can be a danger to the societies in which they live, Paul said.

This conclusion, made on the basis of discussion of sectoral problems of the London Conference on Recovery, told at a briefing Vmediacenter Ukraine - Ukrniforor Yurrienkov CEO of Metinvest Group.

The focus of the participants of the discussion, he said, was represented by Ukraine concept of "green" metallurgy, restoration of the country and decarbonization of the industry.

“Now the whole world goes by decarbonization, production of" green "steel. And in Ukraine(Unfortunately because of the war)It is possible to start everything with a "clean sheet" to do everything right. Therefore, metallurgists, equipment manufacturers, as well as their nervants, present at the West, spoke of interest in making such plans more quickly. After all, it is the possibility of real changes that the maintenance, financial and technological support can bring Ukraine to the first places in world metallurgy, ”Ryzhenkov said.

In his opinion, foreign partners also understand that Ukraine will be part of the European Union, so it is necessary to rebuild it immediately as a component of the EU and European products of production. Therefore, they are also interested in taking advantage of the benefits that Ukraine has: significant coats of iron ore, prepared by experts who are able to work, access to renewable electricity sources.

All this, the industrialist said, will help our country become a competitive EU abilities in the production of "green" steel.

This prevents long -term [investments](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-investicii).

"It is necessary to work on both financial institutions and Ukrainian law," Ryzhenkov said.

He considers another challenge to be a personnel problem: many workers have gone by Nafront, and there are not enough specialists in production. After victory, they will return.

“However, this may not be enough. It is very important to return Ukrainians from abroad to successfully implement the projects, ”Ryzhenkov summed up.

“The big problem is that Russia hides most prisoners. We are such a way that at least 10,000, at least prisoners of war, is now a birth, and most of it is not confirmed. Even those who came out of [azovstal](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-azovstal), where the International Committee of the Red Cross was present at the exit, they filled certain questionnaires, now unconfirmed by Russia, ”Epifanova said, adding that there was no information about many -toughened people.

Epifanova reported that there are groups of Ukrainian volunteers who visit colonies in temporarily occupied territories and provide unofficial information about the prisoners. In addition, there are frequent cases of "trade" information by Russian invaders about the stay of Ukrainian -bewildear there.

According to Epifanova, the most reliable source of information about prisoners who returned from Russian prisons.

“The most productive source of finding information about our prisoners is our military prisoners of war. They see, communicate, and then convert, the stories share the stories that have happened to them. And we find people with information from returned prisoners of war, but we still have no official confirmation that Russia holds them. And it turns out that they are officially missing, ”Epifanova said.

According to Ukrinform, clarification on the introduction of the Unified Register was in a comment [Ukrainian Radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101702&fbclid=IwAR3qWylOHkRH6qbMblTo0KAOcMQ3GisVIUSYgHGInYsokvJtV9pe37lovdc)Criminal law expert Gregory Usaty.

As reminded in Ukrainian radio, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is consulted that it will help to automate weapons and make permissions convenient and accessible to ordinary people.

The unified register of weapons will provide for the creation of e -offices. From now on, the Ukrainians will be able to receive the service without leaving home, submitting documents through a "single window of a citizen" or in a weapon sales store.

Commenting on the introduction of a unified register of weapons, the criminal expert has rightly suggested that "a good example of using the" Action "system can be mentioned here.

With regard to the purpose of registration of firearms, the Udaty noted that "it is not only about the accessibility to the register of Ukrainian citizens and the transformation of services is more reliable and more convenient."

"The main goal is to effectively prevent and investigate crimes that weapons can be achieved. expert.

According to him, "regarding the functioning of the Unified Register of Weapons of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is an effective control of the whole cycle of use [weapons](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zbroa)- That is, to make the processes of licensing of permits, acquisition, possession, check, neutralization and other processes concerning weapons, transparent. "

"Automation of such information support for the compression of weapons circulation is also envisaged. That is, the National Police can record the facts of the abduction of weapons, which makes it impossible for the corruption component in this area. Because it will make meters of the official, for example, from the permitting system to the citizen, the That is, when we talk about transparent services, we can mention a good example when I was recommended only on the positive side using the "Action" system. So the Ministry of Internal Affairs trying to direct its efforts approximately in such a way, " - explained the expert.He added that "some notes that weapons can be obtained" one -click. " War click. "

According to the expert, "the creation of a register of weapons is a desperate attempt at the Ministry of Internal Affairs somewhat to order what is exactly the ordering."

He emphasized that "Ukraine is the only state in Europe that still has no Armorable law."

"Bill No. 5708 of June 25, 2021" On the Right to Civilian Occasional Weapons "remained a law, because literally in the day until the full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, Assham on February 23, 2022, but approved as a basis. The year is ongoing, and we have no law, " - said.

Therefore, according to the expert, "the Ministry of Internal Affairs realizes that it is nowhere else to pull. They are required to move and organize the circulation of weapons. Therefore, they take a step that depends on them."

However, the expert stressed that "these processes are independent of each other. After all, the Ministry of Internal Affairs represents the executive branch of power in the state, and the legislator - the legislative. So we very much need a weapons law, but the question is in what form."

He also noted that "today we cannot say that the permission of a firearm is acceptable."

"Therefore, everyone should know that in Ukraine there is free wearing on the streets today.(Pistols and revolvers), trophy weapons, recycled weapons, explosives and grenades. The weapon, which is tuned under the shots, is also outlawed, "the expert emphasized.

He stated that "we also do not have the purchase of weapons for self -defense."

"Therefore, the order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which has existed since the 1990s, allows only the purchase and circulation of the weapons of a corresponding purpose, in particular it is about hunting weapons,"-added.

In addition, the specialist explained what weapons Ukrainians can buy.

He added that "the purchase, storage and use of these weapons is performed under certain conditions."

"The Ministry of Internal Affairs may have gone further, but provided there will be a weapons law. Now, I think it is too early to say," the expert summed up.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-22T18-22-58-03-00/630_360_1687446748-704.jpg)The strike of the Povongar Bridge, which was inflicted this morning, is very complicated by Russian invaders.

The head of the Majlisukhrim Tatar people Refat Chubarov told about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.

“At the level of propagandists, politicians who do not make decisions - I mean colaborators - the occupiers are beginning to scatter themselves with psvodomists, they say, to investigate in the centers of decision -making in Ukraine. But they allegedly forgot that the fucking on [Crimea](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-crimea)They have been harvested from 9th last year. It began with a military airfield in Novofedorivka, then the destroyed ammunition depots near Jankoy, drowning on the headquarters in the Black Sea. The shot on the Chongar Bridge is one of the strokes that gives a powerful signal that in the field of view of the Armed Forces - the other, perhaps, more important are the Bus in the temporarily occupied Crimea. I mean the Cherkch Strait of the Kerch Strait, ”Chubarov said.

He noted that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people monitors the situation of the occupied Crimea.

I think there, detachment, there and despair. Logistics was very complicated for the invaders. And now this artery is blocked, at least on departure from Crimean Kherson, ”Chubarov said.

According to him, the invaders began to direct transport columns to Bikkrasnopekopskaya, Armenian, through Kalanchak and Chaplinka. However, these roads are unsuccessful for large transport flows.

“And the road through the Chongar Bridge played an important role for the supplies of ammunition. They were thus delivered from the temporarily occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions to the Crimea. Because after undermining the Kerch Strait, the invaders are afraid to overload it. This centennial is harmful and there is a threat that can not withstand, ”the head of the Majlis added.Chubarov noted that there is still all opportunities in Ukraine to destroy the invaders in the temporarily occupied Crimea in Ukraine.

In the case of radiation hazard, it is necessary to get a job as soon as possible and follow the instructions of the SES and local authorities.

Tips on what to do if a radiation accident happened [the Ministry of Health](https://moz.gov.ua/article/news/moz-nagadue-scho-robiti-u-razi-radiacijnoi-avarii), reports Ukrinform.

"First of all, remember that nuclear-strategic objects are built so that they can keep significant physical damage. Each region is constantly undergoing nursing [radiation](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-radiacia)background to make sure that all indicators are normal. Regional centrcont control and prevention of the Ministry of Health are performed. In the event of an emergency, more detailed instructions for the one who should follow the following and other recommendations will be widespread through the information channels of the SES and local authorities. Most importantly - you need to stay indoors or urgently go on the street if you are on the street. This is the safest action that is a must -have, "the statement said.

First, the Ministry of Health advises ** to be in shelter. ** It can be a basement or other access. Radioactive material settles on the outside of the buildings, so it is best to stay as far away from the walls and the roof of the building. It is also necessary to keep the pets and not allow them to walk outside. If possible, you should look in the room without windows and outer doors, close the windows and doors, seal the holes with handy means(adhesive tape moistened with water fabric, etc.)Tag ventilation systems(air conditioners or heaters)In the house. It should be in shelter until the official authorities gave other instructions.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-22T18-50-58-03-00/1687448901-756.jpg)Secondly, ** You need to monitor the official sources of information: ** this message from rescuers(SES), police, local authorities. "Turn on television, radio, follow the official channels of information. Exactly, sign up for such channels on Telegram or Facebook. If locals and emergency officers give instructions - be sure to follow them," the Ministry of Health was voiced.

They also recommend ** to wash if there is the opportunity: ** "Take a shower with a witch, wash your head with shampoo. Do not use hair conditioners as they can secure radioactive material on it. Do not rub and non -rented skin so that the radioactive material does not get in There are no open wounds. If you can take a shower, wash your hands with soap under running water, face and open body parts. If there is no access to water, use it with wipes, damp cloth. Pay special attention to the hands of the yobiccia, wipe your eyelids, eyelashes, ears. "

Need ** also to wear clean clothes. **

"Help your family and loved ones perform the above actions. Doing it in gloves and mask or respirator," the MOH called in the MOH

With regard to ** water and food safety ** they reported that packaging protects the liquid inside from radioactive substances. So only water in bottles will weigh the safe(not contaminated)while the rescuers or the authorities are not notified of the safety of tap water.

Boiling tap water does not deprive it of radioactive substances. Therefore, the brain will have a supply of water in bottles or other sealed containers. Drinks are also safe for use. Water in other containers in the house, such as a toilet or water heater, will not contain radioactive substances. Water or well water can be used for washing yourself, as well as packing with food and water.

Even if tap water is contaminated, it can still be used for decontamination. Any radioactive material that falls in all or groundwater will be diluted with water to a very low level and will be safe for washing skin, hair and clothing.

By analogy with water, foodstuffs are safe if you are stored(canned cans, jars, bottles, boxes, etc.). Такожбезпечною є їжа з холодильника та морозильної камери.

This was stated by the European Commissioner for the expansion of the neighborhood of the neighborhood of Oliver Vargey at the results of the informal meeting of the EU General Affairs Ministers for General Affairs, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“The greatest obstacle is war, the war itself. It attacks people, it is a man on economy and infrastructure, it is an attack against the very existence of Ukraine. So, when this war is over, all the processes of preparation of the dawn will be accelerated, ”the European Commissar said.

The question is not that. There is a clear proposal from the European Union of Ukraine to become a member. The question is - when and how we can fulfill all the criteria for this. Is the war an obstacle? This should be discussed(EU), but at the conclusion I made last year, at this stage was not an obstacle. It did not prevent Ukraine from becoming a candidate country ”

According to him, the transformation into a member country is a much more complicated tattoral procedure, it will take some time. "Because it is a proferee, about parliamentary ratification, about the development of an agreement ... When this process is over, we will hope that the war will end. Because it will be completed as soon as possible," the European Commission's representative added.

He noted that every consistent step in the process of EU expansion has its difficulties. Obtaining the status of a candidate country was a challenge for Ukraine.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-22T22-37-00-03-00/630_360_1687462725-437.png)Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, and anyone who closed their eyes on its occupation by the Russian occupation actually contribute to terror.

According to Ukrinform, about it in his [traditional evening address](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/potribna-povna-deokupaciya-zaporizkoyi-aes-bud-hto-hto-zaply-83753)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

_ ** Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!** _

Today was a very busy day.

First, they briefed for partner countries about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya atomic station. There were representatives of the countries of the Great Seven, "Grand Twenty", representatives of international organizations. Here in the office. A available information has been provided from the GUR, from the commissioner, from our diplomats.

Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier prepares. Everyone who knows has to act. Of course, after a Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, terrorists on other dams and energy objects of the old one in the world should not have any illusions about Russia. It is Russia that is now the brigal center of cynicism, and from there may be any order for any excellent, which they expect to mask under one or another catastrophe. The world has a complicated power to prevent any radiation incidents and, moreover, a radiation disaster. Everyone understands that intelligence of different countries can give corresponding signals, they can press. This is required.

We will continue to inform partners. Information will also be provided to those countries that have some neutrality even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask, who is unnecessary, and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the lightisarase can help, and what to do is quite known.

Full de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear station is required. And anyone who has fulfilled their eyes on Russia's occupation of such an object, on the mines of Russia, the territory of the structures of the nuclear power plant, in fact contributes not only to this Russian gun, but terror in general. And today I instructed the Minister of Internal Affairs Klimenko Igor to take all necessary measures, all the necessary work with our people on all available risks. And in the near future it will be done.Of course, we also have information about what is happening in the occupied part of the Serson region. To do this, even the word "catastrophe" is not enough. The Russian wicked special groups there to remove and obviously hide the Tilasagid people. And this is not the first time Russia is trying to destroy the evidence of its crimes in the occupied territory. So they did in Mariupol, other places. But this is the truth that you do not hide. And I thank everyone who helps our intelligence, our special services to get the information they need!

He also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue the correspondence, and there will be new steps. Obviously, there can be no spiritual communication with the terrorist state and those who justify the murder, murder of Ukrainians and cover evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror is custom. And we will reach the moment when all the dependence on Russia, which is trying to manipulate somewhere, will be destroyed.

One more.

I want to give especially to all those who, even at that time, even in such circumstances, that our people and our country are small cultural power. Today, the next book Aresenal began in Kyiv. "Arsenal" is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. What makes people people. What makes humanity stronger. What protects and spreads through time our experience - everyone and everyone, all of our Ukraine, all our Ukraine, all our Europe, all our humanity. Bellas, if you have the opportunity, visit one of these days Book Arsenal and always support cultural power.

I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone who is now in the battles - in the south, in the east, in Zaporozhye, in Donetsk region, in Luhansk region. Thank you!

Thank you all who help Ukraine and protect their lives and humanity with us!

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

“It is right now that thousands of FPV-pings are needed, because they are fast, accurate, maneuverable and destroy a lot of Russian equipment. We have a budget for the purchase of UAVs, but not every Ukrainian company is ready to produce so many drones. One of the main reasons - companies did not pass all the steps for operation due to the complexity of the process, ”the minister said.

He noted that the government removed almost all the blockers, introduced Fast-Track for UAVs, created special areas for pilot training and drone testing, eliminated bureaucracy, simplified its admission and more.

In addition, the minister reported that the Drone Army team will constantly advise manufacturers for documents, helps organize testing at the landfill, etc. Therefore, it is not necessary for Ukrainian developers to worry about the passage of all procedures.

“We are always ready to help you get contracts and scale production faster. I am sure, together we will make a revolution in the development of FPV-digters. Ahead of work before, ”said Mikhail Fedorov.

"The field of debris indicates the disintegration of the underwater apparatus, which indeed indicates that the worst scenario is a catastrophic failure and, as a rule, an explosion," said expert David Mirns, who was familiar with two passengers of the boat.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-22T7-37-00-03-00/630_360_1687462725-437.png)Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, and anyone who closed their eyes on its occupation by the Russian occupation actually contribute to terror.

According to Ukrinform, about it in his [traditional evening address](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/potribna-povna-deokupaciya-zaporizkoyi-aes-bud-hto-hto-zaply-83753)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

_ ** Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!** _

Today was a very busy day.

First, they briefed for partner countries about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya atomic station. There were representatives of the countries of the Great Seven, "Grand Twenty", representatives of international organizations. Here in the office. A available information has been provided from the GUR, from the commissioner, from our diplomats.

Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier prepares. Everyone who knows has to act. Of course, after a Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, terrorists on other dams and energy objects of the old one in the world should not have any illusions about Russia. It is Russia that is now the brigal center of cynicism, and from there may be any order for any excellent, which they expect to mask under one or another catastrophe. The world has a complicated power to prevent any radiation incidents and, moreover, a radiation disaster. Everyone understands that intelligence of different countries can give corresponding signals, they can press. This is required.

We will continue to inform partners. Information will also be provided to those countries that have some neutrality even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask, who is unnecessary, and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the lightisarase can help, and what to do is quite known.

Full de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear station is required. And anyone who has fulfilled their eyes on Russia's occupation of such an object, on the mines of Russia, the territory of the structures of the nuclear power plant, in fact contributes not only to this Russian gun, but terror in general. And today I instructed the Minister of Internal Affairs Klimenko Igor to take all necessary measures, all the necessary work with our people on all available risks. And in the near future it will be done.Of course, we also have information about what is happening in the occupied part of the Serson region. To do this, even the word "catastrophe" is not enough. The Russian wicked special groups there to remove and obviously hide the Tilasagid people. And this is not the first time Russia is trying to destroy the evidence of its crimes in the occupied territory. So they did in Mariupol, other places. But this is the truth that you do not hide. And I thank everyone who helps our intelligence, our special services to get the information they need!

He also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue the correspondence, and there will be new steps. Obviously, there can be no spiritual communication with the terrorist state and those who justify the murder, murder of Ukrainians and cover evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror is custom. And we will reach the moment when all the dependence on Russia, which is trying to manipulate somewhere, will be destroyed.

One more.

I want to give especially to all those who, even at that time, even in such circumstances, that our people and our country are small cultural power. Today, the next book Aresenal began in Kyiv. "Arsenal" is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. What makes people people. What makes humanity stronger. What protects and spreads through time our experience - everyone and everyone, all of our Ukraine, all our Ukraine, all our Europe, all our humanity. Bellas, if you have the opportunity, visit one of these days Book Arsenal and always support cultural power.

I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone who is now in the battles - in the south, in the east, in Zaporozhye, in Donetsk region, in Luhansk region. Thank you!

Thank you all who help Ukraine and protect their lives and humanity with us!

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

У прямому ефірі [телемарафону](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news" Military expert Colonel Petro Chernyk expressed his opinion on the possible further development of the counter -offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Tavarients.

- I would describe the front for this moment: the so -called mixed fighting, - says the military analyst. - What does it mean? There are areas in the south, where we have good well -weighted results: outside the 100 square kilometers of our territory. But at the eastern bridgehead, especially in the Kupyansk, Liman Ina Bakhmut directions, the enemy is still in a state of the attacking person. At the same time, the number of average daily attacks has decreased significantly: if it was out of 100-120, it now fell to 40. The enemy and supranhamaggamags to realize a strategic minimum strategic task: to enter the administrative border of these two regions. After all, the strategic task-maximum is torn: Ukrainian statehood has withstood, and they could not eliminate our independence.

Petro Chernyk also acknowledges that a somewhat overstated evaluation of our possibleness prevails in society, because everyone wants this operation to liberate Ukrainian earths as lightning as Kharkiv. The analyst is convinced that the enemy learned that lesson, built very serious lines of defense.

- And to afford the classic "Zhukovshchyna" - as they throw the personnel under Bakhmut, just huge human waves - we cannot, - the statement. - At this moment there is a touch of their defense lines, and I think it is quite successful. I am sure one: the most serious combat operations will be used in the cycle of dry weather. It is from today to mid -autumn. A aviation appears, then we can talk about a turning point of the war.

Today was a very busy day.

First, they briefed for partner countries about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya atomic station. There were representatives of the countries of the Great Seven, "Grand Twenty", representatives of international organizations. Here in the office. A available information has been provided from the GUR, from the commissioner, from our diplomats.

Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier prepares. Everyone who knows has to act. Of course, after a Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, terrorists on other dams and energy objects of the old one in the world should not have any illusions about Russia. It is Russia that is now the brigal center of cynicism, and from there may be any order for any excellent, which they expect to mask under one or another catastrophe. The world has a complicated power to prevent any radiation incidents and, moreover, a radiation disaster. Everyone understands that intelligence of different countries can give corresponding signals, they can press. This is required.

We will continue to inform partners. Information will also be provided to those countries that have some neutrality even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask, who is unnecessary, and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the lightisaraz can help, and what to do is quite known.

Full de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear station is required. And anyone who has fulfilled their eyes on Russia's occupation of such an object, on the mines of Russia, the territory of the structures of the nuclear power plant, in fact contributes not only to this Russian gun, but terror in general. And today I instructed the Minister of Internal Affairs Klimenko Igor to take all necessary measures, all the necessary work with our people on all available risks. And in the near future it will be done.

Today, the SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs have spoken appropriate security issues - ITe concerning the Zaporizhzhya station, and what concerns the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Station. We do our best to connect as much as possible and means to pressure and influence on the terrorist state. There was also a separate report of internal affairs to support people and life in the Kherson region and the greetings of our south, which were affected by the destruction of the Kakhovsky Damage.He also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue the correspondence, and there will be new steps. Obviously, there can be no spiritual communication with the terrorist state and those who justify the murder, murder of Ukrainians and cover evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror is custom. And we will reach the moment when all the dependence on Russia, which is trying to manipulate somewhere, will be destroyed.

One more.

I want to give especially to all those who, even at that time, even in such circumstances, that our people and our country are small cultural power. Today, the next book Aresenal began in Kyiv. "Arsenal" is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. What makes people people. What makes humanity stronger. What protects and through time spreads our experience - everyone and everyone, all of our Ukraine, all our Ukraine, all our Europe, all our humanity. Bellas, if you have the opportunity, visit one of these days Book Arsenal and always support cultural power.

I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone who is now in the battles - in the south, in the east, in Zaporozhye, in the Donetsk region, in Luhansk region. Thank you!

Thank you all who help Ukraine and protect their lives and humanity with us!

_Glory to Ukraine!_

In the evening air(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news" Military expert Colonel Petro Chernyk analyzed some of thestatic data taken from the daily reports of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

- The best argument is the numbers, - Petro Chernik is convinced. - If you choose an average of 55 guns a week for a week throughout the war, then the enemy lost 553 trunks - this is an incredibly much. And now, the figure, the figure has already exceeded 400 - I think that this month there will be a new record. Let me remind you that the full -time team has 72 guns in service - to make it clear what tremendous losses the enemy suffered.

At the same time, says a military scientist, at the enemy there are still at least 15 thousand trunks - let the old scrap, but the Russians will still take it from conservation and throw it into battle.

- This difficult job will have to be done, - the officer admits. -But the very fact that the 15th army of the world has on the offensive on the "second" army of the world, which is far away, is a historical phenomenon. Multiple literature will be written about it.
