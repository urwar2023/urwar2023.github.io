We need to understand that in our climatic conditions a reservoir(of this size of tangotropogenic load)It should be a depth of at least 8 m. This is due to the third factors. First, in order not to freeze in winter(this is important to recover biota). По-друге, для підтримки кисневого режимувлітку. Якщо перегріти стоячі води, то згідно з законом Дальтона, кисень почневипаровуватися, що призведе до мору риби. Третє.

“The geography of sailing sports is such that it is the south and the center of Ukraine, since the championships were previously happening there. But we were lucky that there is a strong -headed team that is supported by the business and the dream of holding the Ukrainian Championships here. I hope that in the near future we will open school sports here, ” - said the head of the youth and sports department Roman Khimak.
The Championship of Ukraine on Lake Sirka was held on June 1 - 10 in two stages. About 80 athletes from different regions of Ukraine took part in 11 age -olds. They presented their skills in 4 types of ILCA and Ultra programs, and the assembly of the competition consisted of 12 fleet races.

There are participants who have gone abroad and train there, Eperesetans, such as Mariupols who live in Kiev, but stand for Mariupol . This regatta is not only a event for Ukraine, but also an opportunity for us to develop a sailing of Uregion, and the Yavoriv Sea is quite suitable for this, ” - said Gumenetsky.

The partner of the Galician sailing Association Oksana Novikova noted that Tsuvodoim was chosen because she is the largest in the Lviv region - about three kilometers, up to 70 meters.
“It was a sulfur quarry and the water is very clean here. The dance is not surrounded by the forest of the chizabudo, and for sailing sports the main thing is that the wind has a wind. Isudi and participants are satisfied, ”she said.
After the awarding of the participants, a concert with the participation of Solomiya Chubai, the Inso-Lviv Orchestra and the Miklukho Maklay ethno-group, as well as treating Ukrainian Cossacks, were treated.

"The water will not disappear. However, there will now be a temporary swamp in this city. And then the nature will come up with what to do with this territory.
We need to understand that in our climatic conditions a reservoir(of this size of tangotropogenic load)It should be a depth of at least 8 m. This is due to the third factors. First, in order not to freeze in winter(this is important to recover biota). По-друге, для підтримки кисневого режимувлітку. Якщо перегріти стоячі води, то згідно з законом Дальтона, кисень почневипаровуватися, що призведе до мору риби. Третє. Для нейтралізуваннязворотних/очищених стічних вод та подальшого біологічного доочищення – уводосховищі має бути достатній об’єм води. Нагадую, заводи та ЖКГ Запоріжжяберуть воду вище запорізької греблі, а скидають стічні води у Каховськеводосховище. Й інші міста так само", - написав він.
Своєю чергою інші науковці зазначають, що після підриву дамби розпочалосяобміління водосховища і його глибина зараз становить трохи більш як 10 метрів.Тобто зараз неможливий забір води для побутових споживачів та на ЗапорізькійАЕС.

«Коли ми відвідуємо людину в місці утримання або російська сторона офіційнопідтверджує полон – одразу повідомляємо рідним, – зазначила представниця МКЧХ.– Однак у випадках, коли отримуємо відомості про полонених від звільнених, неповідомляємо про це близьким. Бо такі дані не є перевіреними».
Координаційний штаб не заперечує, щоб Захисники, які повернулися, повідомлялирідним про тих, кого бачили в полоні.
«Навіть даємо їм контакти родичів. Але близькі не повинні розголошуватиінформацію про місце утримання своїх Оборонців. Це може нашкодити і їм, іперемовинам про обмін», – застеріг представник Штабу.
Також він підкреслив, що військова частина має повноваження проводити службоверозслідування стосовно зникнення військовослужбовця й надання йому обліковоїкатегорії, але не вповноважена займатися пошуком, перемовинами та визволеннямз полону.

 - They say that the wounded scream, but in fact it is one. Pain shock, manifestation, too, says the fiction of Soviet medicine. It is not. The person, when injured, feels pain, but not acute. The organism turns on their reserves, and therefore the wounded mostly do not scream. They are scraping, oying, angry. I remember one platoon commander - multiple -lounge wounds, blood loss, fracture. It was at night, we worked with subtle lanterns, I checked the imposed turnstiles, tamming. It is dark, my face is not visible, I work without painkillers, this guy hurts and he says, "Survise - I will give you a muzzle!" And then, already at the stabbon, he saw me, recognized and said: "Sorry, Doc" … And I, "I have not heard that about myself." He survived, is now recovering.

According to him, representatives of agricultural business, private companies and associations of Ukraine have put a reliable shoulder of Syloborons from the beginning of the rose -component invasion of Russia into Ukraine.
 - You are also the forces of Ukraine's defense and our victory also depends on you. I want to thank you pleasant and honest. Despite the fact that the wedbusiness has stopped many, that the fields are replaced, you have not stopped. You want to do your business, sow fields, harvest and use the country's defense forces. At different international sites, I will always tell you: every Ukrainian will fight, and not as everyone thought that the Great Soviet Army would fight the small Soviet army. We are not the army and the non -Soviet country for a long time. We are others, we are free. We are ready to risk our lives, health, property, property, anything. The main thing is to preserve the gap, our freedom. We will definitely not leave this war to our grandchildren and have been able to win it, - said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

 This week, the official visit of the UK Prime Minister Rishsunak to Washington took place. The issues of strengthening economic cooperation and the United States, as well as international security were discussed. The main result of the meeting of leaders is the signed Atlantic Declaration. Which means for Ukraine to comprehend the strategic partnership between London and Washington further by the ArmyInform.
The Union of Britain and the United States, better known as "special relations", was formed during the Second World War due to the efforts of Winston Churchill Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At that time, the purpose of the unification was a joint struggle of nobility.
And now, in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine, strengthening the role of China and Cybersecurity, the US and Britain's partnership for future international relations. First of all, it is the basis of NATO-the main military-political alliance of the West, which realizes the connection of European and Asian security.
Recall that it was Risha Snak's first visit during his premiere to the United States.(Union of Britain, Australia and USA)and artificial intelligence.
The main goal of Snak was to restart "special relations" on the background of the world. Namely: Britain left the EU, three premiere in 2022, a Russian invasion of Ukraine, security threats to the side of Iran.
The main theme, which is at the same time teasing and important not only for Britain, but also US Allies as a whole, is the exchange of the latest defense technologies. Recall that Washington's closest allies, such as Great, Taiwan or Israel, in fact, buy weapons, but according to a simplified procedure. Therefore, there is a need to reduce bureaucratic moments about the rapid access to technology."Collaboration with ancient allies and partners is crucial for the achievements of the United States in the fight against the more dynamic threat from their opponents," the next conclusion makes Deborah Cherton.
Why Technologies are important 
The essence of Snak's visit to the United States is to strengthen the economic security of bilateral trade. The United States and Britain have signed an Atlantic, the text of which was published on Bigolot's site .
 It is noted that the new partnership will be based on 5 topics:
Provision of US and UK leadership in critical and new technologies * ; Failure to collaborate on economic security and supply and supply chains; * partnership in inclusive and responsible digital digital partnership Transformations ; Creating the Economy of Pure Energy of the Future; Further Strengthening the Alliance in Defense, Health and Space. 
At the end of 2023, a summit on the safety of an artificial intelligence will be held in the United Kingdom. In general, everything goes to the fact that such technologies will be cooked by international efforts to protect against threats.
Separately, two leaders discussed the New Civil Nuclear Partnership. It is especially important as a prerequisite for the sanctions of the US and Britain against Rosatom.
Joe Biden said during the stay of Rice Snak in the White House that "there was no country closer to the United States than Britain." And that's really.
Both leaders have expressed their readiness to support Ukraine in its struggle of anti -Russian aggression. "Together, we provide economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine's security trials in its fight against the cruel invasion of Russia," Joe Biden said.
The US President and the British Prime Minister, having signed the Atlantic, confirmed their determination to strengthen the transatlantic security. Especially within joint actions within NATO.
 Although there are complex moments, especially economical, between Britain and the US.
Yes, the countries did not sign the Free Trade Agreement - mostly because of political moments to regulate further trade between Northern Ireland Ireland. Recall that Joe Bayden Irishman is in origin and therefore it is personal.
However, the parties agreed to the disappearance of obstacles that affect the nationary of the battery for electric vehicles from Britain to the United States.
The Atlantic Declaration also mentioned the creation of a "new British British-SSE bridge". This means that the British business will be able to transmit information to certified organizations in the US without paying a fee.
What Snak's visit to the US means for Ukraine 
First of all, it is about the possibility of prompt access to the latest technologies. For an effective reflection of modern security threats, which relate not only to the conservation confrontation on the battlefield, but also to cyberspace, it is worth establishing a careful exchange of technologies with allies of Ukraine. It is primarily about the US Ibritan.
Providing military assistance, that is, weapons of Ukraine, it is necessary to strengthen production. Simply put, the joint production of weapons will accelerate our victory and at the same time translate Ukraine's defense complex to NATO standards.
And secondly, the future development of the United States and Britain depends on the further unification of countries for which the main values of Edemocratia, freedom and human rights. And the victory of Ukraine in the war, which was made by Russia in 2014, will mean strengthening of democratic processes, an important part of which is Britain and the USA. We need to do everything in order to punish the aggressor that is a threat to Europe and the world.

 The Crimean Korolator blogger Oleksandr Talipov revealed details of the preparation by the occupiers of Kakhovskaya HEPs in his telegram.
About it reports MOV Intelligence Directorate.
In particular, Talipov was indignant with the posts of the so -called Russian "military bloggers", who reported that the personnel of the invaders were thrown on the islands of Ivona "in critical condition almost on trees." In fact, as explained by the Taulipov, this is all the fake: “I contacted our boys. Everyone came out of the islands. There was no one else's night. There are no losses. Therefore, all the information that is supplemented in this way is a brazen lie. "
This is a direct evidence that the Russian military knew about the future terrorist attack pasuvatly declared evacuation.
There is a high likelihood that after the wide publicity of this information, the allyraditiously will try to declare the "enemy of the people" or "agent of the Ukrainian Special services". However, the number of such evidence is increasing. They will all become an additional evidence in the future tribunal.

Ще однією ворожою поплічницею виявилась мешканка тимчасово окупованогоТроїцького Луганської області.
Під час захоплення селища вона добровільно погодилась очолити «управліннябухгалтерського обліку та фінансового забезпечення» у складі місцевоїокупаційної адміністрації рф.
На цій «посаді» вона формує кошторис «бюджетних» видатків для матеріально-технічного забезпечення окупантів.
У Херсонській області: 
викрито трьох мешканців обласного центру, які у період окупації міста обійняликерівні «посади» у створеній загарбниками «виборчій комісії».
Вони організовували проведення фейкового плебісциту щодо приєднання регіону дорф.
Для цього колаборанти відкрили «виборчі дільниці» у декількох місцевих школахі лікарнях. Далі вони «накручували» голоси на користь країни-агресора.
Під час звільнення Херсона колаборанти втекли на тимчасово захоплену частинурегіону і наразі переховуються від правосуддя.
In all exposed facts, comprehensive measures are underway to bring notories to justice for crimes against Ukraine.
