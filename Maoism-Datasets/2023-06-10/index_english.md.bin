The Security Service has collected a evidence of another participant in the DNR terrorist organization, which fought on the side of the aggressor country and committed the crimes of the counter-residents of Kherson region.

Together with the Russian troops, he actively participated in the captured kakhovka and robbing of local dwellings in 2022. During robbery, he used weapons and threatened murder in the event of resistance.

In this way, the racists "brought out" from the premises of citizens everything - from household appliances to money and other valuable things.

The attacker was captured by Ukrainian defenders last December during the Kherson direction.

According to the materials of the Ukrainian special service, the court appointed him 15 years in prison.

As the investigation was established, a fighter was a resident of Donetsk, who at the beginning of a full-scale invasion initiatively joined the ranks of the 9th Regiment of the Marine Infantry of the 1st Army Corps of the Russian Federation.

While in the post of Senior Sagittarius of the enemy unit, he fired the defense forces on the Eastern Front.

He was later transferred to a temporarily captured part of Kherson region.

On the basis of the evidence collected, the court found the attacker guilty of three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:

* Part 1 of Art. 438(violation of the laws and customs of war); * h. 2 s. 111(a state betrayal committed in a state of martial law); * h 5 p. 260(Participation in the activities not provided by law of armed formations).

Служба безпеки наголошує на невідворотності покарання за злочини проти нашоїдержави.

The power of the terrorist country continues to exist in parallel reality and to submit a narrative, as if Ukrainians and Russians-"brotherly peoples" who want to be in peace.

In addition, this narrative is sometimes transformed into a "single people".

Such statements of the Russian Federation continue to deny the existence of Ukraine as a separate subject and to offset Ukrainian statehood.

According to Ukrinform, the corresponding video is presented in [telegram](https://t.me/lachentyt/30283)Famous blogger Igor Lachenkov(TG channel "LACHEN WRISH").

Раніше еколог, експерт з управління природоохоронною діяльністю, екологічноїполітики та моніторингу стану і якості довкілля, кандидат технічних наукМаксим Сорока на своїй сторінці у Фейсбуці, відповідаючи на запитанняукраїнців, прогнозував, що Каховське _**[ водосховище не зникне, алеперетвориться на болото ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3720654-kahovske-vodoshovise-ne-znikne-ale-peretvoritsa-na-boloto.html)** _.

"The water will not disappear. However, there will now be a temporary swamp in this city. And then the nature will come up with what to do with this territory.

We need to understand that in our climatic conditions a reservoir(of this size of tangotropogenic load)It should be a depth of at least 8 m. This is due to the third factors. First, in order not to freeze in winter(this is important to recover biota). По-друге, для підтримки кисневого режимувлітку. Якщо перегріти стоячі води, то згідно з законом Дальтона, кисень почневипаровуватися, що призведе до мору риби. Третє. Для нейтралізуваннязворотних/очищених стічних вод та подальшого біологічного доочищення – уводосховищі має бути достатній об’єм води. Нагадую, заводи та ЖКГ Запоріжжяберуть воду вище запорізької греблі, а скидають стічні води у Каховськеводосховище. Й інші міста так само", - написав він.

Своєю чергою інші науковці зазначають, що після підриву дамби розпочалосяобміління водосховища і його глибина зараз становить трохи більш як 10 метрів.Тобто зараз неможливий забір води для побутових споживачів та на ЗапорізькійАЕС.

The judoist also stressed that the uncertainty with the possible performance of the Olympiad in Paris has a negative effect on its motivation.

“Thoughts about the possible pass of the Olympiad, if there are Russians and Belarusians, upset and adversely affect motivation, because it is difficult to look in the dog in such conditions. In the near future, we will understand if they will participate in the Volympiad. Ukraine, together with athletes, does everything to ensure that the representatives of Russia and Belarus were not in the games. I hope everything will succeed, ”Daria said.

According to the correspondent of Ukrinform, through the occupation of Crimea, the danger of shelling of Mykolaiv, Odessa, Zaporizhzhya regions for the first time Lviv region is accepting the masters of sailing sports.

“The geography of sailing sports is such that it is the south and the center of Ukraine, since the championships were previously happening there. But we were lucky that there is a strong -headed team that is supported by the business and the dream of holding the Ukrainian Championships here. I hope that in the near future we will open school sports here, ” - said the head of the youth and sports department Roman Khimak.

The Championship of Ukraine on Lake Sirka was held on June 1 - 10 in two stages. About 80 athletes from different regions of Ukraine took part in 11 age -olds. They presented their skills in 4 types of ILCA and Ultra programs, and the assembly of the competition consisted of 12 fleet races. On the last day of the competition, the youngest participants of the competition, in the age categories from 7 to 12 years, class "Terra" showed.

The head of the Galician sailing Association Myron Humenetsky said that for children who seek yaching, the opportunities are now very limited. The number of participants of the Ukrainian Championship has decreased almost 10 times with relatively upstanding competitions.

There are participants who have gone abroad and train there, Eperesetans, such as Mariupols who live in Kiev, but stand for [Mariupol](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-mariupol). This regatta is not only a event for Ukraine, but also an opportunity for us to develop a sailing of Uregion, and the Yavoriv Sea is quite suitable for this, ” - said Gumenetsky.

The partner of the Galician sailing Association Oksana Novikova noted that Tsuvodoim was chosen because she is the largest in the Lviv region - about three kilometers, up to 70 meters.

“It was a sulfur quarry and the water is very clean here. The dance is not surrounded by the forest of the chizabudo, and for sailing sports the main thing is that the wind has a wind. Isudi and participants are satisfied, ”she said.

After the awarding of the participants, a concert with the participation of Solomiya Chubai, the Inso-Lviv Orchestra and the Miklukho Maklay ethno-group, as well as treating Ukrainian Cossacks, were treated.

"The water will not disappear. However, there will now be a temporary swamp in this city. And then the nature will come up with what to do with this territory.

We need to understand that in our climatic conditions a reservoir(of this size of tangotropogenic load)It should be a depth of at least 8 m. This is due to the third factors. First, in order not to freeze in winter(this is important to recover biota). По-друге, для підтримки кисневого режимувлітку.

In Odessa, border guards, patrolling the Black Sea coast, watch that they turn into a landfill and an animal cemetery. The fish begins. Ecocide seeds are horrible.

“At the same time, many mines, ammunition and other extinguished objects are being thrown into the sea, which it throws on the coastal strip. We urge citizens not to neglect their own safety.

Representatives of the Coordination Headquarters of the Tamzhi International Committee of the Red Cross answered to the questions of loved ones(ICCH). Серед іншого обговорили питаннякомунікації працівників Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста з родинами.

«Коли ми відвідуємо людину в місці утримання або російська сторона офіційнопідтверджує полон – одразу повідомляємо рідним, – зазначила представниця МКЧХ.– Однак у випадках, коли отримуємо відомості про полонених від звільнених, неповідомляємо про це близьким. Бо такі дані не є перевіреними».

Координаційний штаб не заперечує, щоб Захисники, які повернулися, повідомлялирідним про тих, кого бачили в полоні.

«Навіть даємо їм контакти родичів. Але близькі не повинні розголошуватиінформацію про місце утримання своїх Оборонців. Це може нашкодити і їм, іперемовинам про обмін», – застеріг представник Штабу.

Також він підкреслив, що військова частина має повноваження проводити службоверозслідування стосовно зникнення військовослужбовця й надання йому обліковоїкатегорії, але не вповноважена займатися пошуком, перемовинами та визволеннямз полону.

It is not. The person, when injured, feels pain, but not acute. The organism turns on their reserves, and therefore the wounded mostly do not scream. They are scraping, oying, angry. I remember one platoon commander - multiple -lounge wounds, blood loss, fracture. It was at night, we worked with subtle lanterns, I checked the imposed turnstiles, tamming. It is dark, my face is not visible, I work without painkillers, this guy hurts and he says, "Survise - I will give you a muzzle!"

Despite the fact that the wedbusiness has stopped many, that the fields are replaced, you have not stopped. You want to do your business, sow fields, harvest and use the country's defense forces. At different international sites, I will always tell you: every Ukrainian will fight, and not as everyone thought that the Great Soviet Army would fight the small Soviet army. We are not the army and the non -Soviet country for a long time. We are others, we are free. We are ready to risk our lives, health, property, property, anything. The main thing is to preserve the gap, our freedom. We will definitely not leave this war to our grandchildren and have been able to win it, - said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

Large -scale forest fires, tremendous natural losses and threat to people ... Ukraine preparation to help with fire extinguishing if Canada requires such international assistance.

Our Ukrainian meaning for international relations is that we should always be able to can be about each other when support is needed. And really help.

I am sure it will become global principles. Mutual action, mutual support, mutual force.

Now, unfortunately, we see that at some levels in the world there is simply a shadebnabisage for ecocide and human tragedy caused by the Russian terrorist attack of the Nakakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant.

When international organizations that should protect life on a global scale, even a week do not have time to form and send a rescue mission to a nailed territory when some world entities do not dare to get out even with clear and strong statements that would condemn this next Russian war, terrorists simply terrorists They are fueled by this weakness of the world, with this carelessness - it encourages them. And we have to overcome it. And we will overcome.

We click and encourage that international organizations, international support in the part of Kherson, where occupiers are now.

As of this time, more than 3,000 people have already been eachamed in the Kherson and Mykolaiv region. But again, it is only free-controlled, controlled by us.All this should be a separate fair and rigid responsibility of the Russian state and the Russian leadership.

And international organizations must work where we have not yet deduced our territories. Every life is important - all of Kherson, all south. Every city is Yelselo. We will do our best and impossible to help all people.

I thank each of our rescuer, military and police, local communities and international organizations that are currently operating in the Kherson region of Tamikolaevshchina, all our volunteers - everyone who helps to save the catastrophe zone and animals, animals and life in general ... and tell the world of the people who suffered.

I thank everyone who helps people after the strikes of Russian rockets and Iranian Shahaneda. Odesa… My condolences to the native those whose lives were taken last by Russian terror… More than 20 wounded. Everyone is assisted.

Like every day, gratitude is our soldiers. Everyone and everyone who is in front of the forefront, at combat posts and combat missions. Who destroys the enemy on the earth protects our sky. Thank you all who hold the position and who moves forward. "Khortytsia", "Tavriya" - thank you to each of our hero!

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-10T94-00-00-04-00/1-1.jpeg)This week, the official visit of the UK Prime Minister Rishsunak to Washington took place. The issues of strengthening economic cooperation and the United States, as well as international security were discussed. The main result of the meeting of leaders is the signed Atlantic Declaration. Which means for Ukraine to comprehend the strategic partnership between London and Washington further by the ArmyInform.

The Union of Britain and the United States, better known as "special relations", was formed during the Second World War due to the efforts of Winston Churchill Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At that time, the purpose of the unification was a joint struggle of nobility.

And now, in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine, strengthening the role of China and Cybersecurity, the US and Britain's partnership for future international relations. First of all, it is the basis of NATO-the main military-political alliance of the West, which realizes the connection of European and Asian security.

Recall that it was Risha Snak's first visit during his premiere to the United States.(Union of Britain, Australia and USA)and artificial intelligence.

The main goal of Snak was to restart "special relations" on the background of the world. Namely: Britain left the EU, three premiere in 2022, a Russian invasion of Ukraine, security threats to the side of Iran.

The main theme, which is at the same time teasing and important not only for Britain, but also US Allies as a whole, is the exchange of the latest defense technologies. Recall that Washington's closest allies, such as Great, Taiwan or Israel, in fact, buy weapons, but according to a simplified procedure. Therefore, there is a need to reduce bureaucratic moments about the rapid access to technology."Collaboration with ancient allies and partners is crucial for the achievements of the United States in the fight against the more dynamic threat from their opponents," the next conclusion makes Deborah Cherton.

### ** Why Technologies are important **

The essence of Snak's visit to the United States is to strengthen the economic security of bilateral trade. The United States and Britain have signed an Atlantic, the text of which was published on [Bigolot's site](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/08/the-atlantic-declaration-a-framework-for-a-twenty-first-century-u-s-uk-economic-partnership/).

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-10T94-00-00-04-00/2.png)It is noted that the new partnership will be based on 5 topics:

*** Provision of US and UK leadership in critical and new technologies ** ** **; ** ** ** ** Failure to collaborate on economic security and supply and supply chains; ** ***** partnership in inclusive and responsible digital digital partnership Transformations ** **; ** ** ** Creating the Economy of Pure Energy of the Future; ** ** ** Further Strengthening the Alliance in Defense, Health and Space. ** ** **

At the end of 2023, a summit on the safety of an artificial intelligence will be held in the United Kingdom. In general, everything goes to the fact that such technologies will be cooked by international efforts to protect against threats.

Separately, two leaders discussed the New Civil Nuclear Partnership. It is especially important as a prerequisite for the sanctions of the US and Britain against Rosatom.

Joe Biden said during the stay of Rice Snak in the White House that "there was no country closer to the United States than Britain." And that's really.

Both leaders have expressed their readiness to support Ukraine in its struggle of anti -Russian aggression. "Together, we provide economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine's security trials in its fight against the cruel invasion of Russia," Joe Biden said.

The US President and the British Prime Minister, having signed the Atlantic, confirmed their determination to strengthen the transatlantic security. Especially within joint actions within NATO.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-10T94-00-00-04-00/3-2.jpeg)Although there are complex moments, especially economical, between Britain and the US.

Yes, the countries did not sign the Free Trade Agreement - mostly because of political moments to regulate further trade between Northern Ireland Ireland. Recall that Joe Bayden Irishman is in origin and therefore it is personal.

However, the parties agreed to the disappearance of obstacles that affect the nationary of the battery for electric vehicles from Britain to the United States.

The Atlantic Declaration also mentioned the creation of a "new British British-SSE bridge". This means that the British business will be able to transmit information to certified organizations in the US without paying a fee.

### ** What Snak's visit to the US means for Ukraine **

First of all, it is about the possibility of prompt access to the latest technologies. For an effective reflection of modern security threats, which relate not only to the conservation confrontation on the battlefield, but also to cyberspace, it is worth establishing a careful exchange of technologies with allies of Ukraine. It is primarily about the US Ibritan.

Providing military assistance, that is, weapons of Ukraine, it is necessary to strengthen production. Simply put, the joint production of weapons will accelerate our victory and at the same time translate Ukraine's defense complex to NATO standards.

And secondly, the future development of the United States and Britain depends on the further unification of countries for which the main values of Edemocratia, freedom and human rights. And the victory of Ukraine in the war, which was made by Russia in 2014, will mean strengthening of democratic processes, an important part of which is Britain and the USA. We need to do everything in order to punish the aggressor that is a threat to Europe and the world.

In particular, Talipov was indignant with the posts of the so -called Russian "military bloggers", who reported that the personnel of the invaders were thrown on the islands of Ivona "in critical condition almost on trees." In fact, as explained by the Taulipov, this is all the fake: “I contacted our boys. Everyone came out of the islands. There was no one else's night. There are no losses. Therefore, all the information that is supplemented in this way is a brazen lie. "

This is a direct evidence that the Russian military knew about the future terrorist attack pasuvatly declared evacuation.

There is a high likelihood that after the wide publicity of this information, the allyraditiously will try to declare the "enemy of the people" or "agent of the Ukrainian Special services".

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-10T98-00-00-04-00/original-2.jpg)The SBU reported suspicion to 8 more collaborators, including the "Minister of Transport" in Crimea and Gaulayter Severodonetsk.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/SecurSerUkraine/posts/pfbid0KyEsNEWPRmZ18gPR2ertXP3MiatxHiVAF3BNujnpXz8X3o3dNQzjVzhRtQzaPJD3l)Security Service of Ukraine.

One of the malefactors is the newly appointed "Minister of Transport of the Republic of Crimea", who headed the pseudo -instruction in April this year on the protection of the traitorAksonov.

According to Moscow, the collaborator provides logistics to the transfer of Russian from the territory of the peninsula to the Southern Front.

** In Luhansk region: **

Gaulayter Severodonetsk will also be judged for voluntary cooperation with the enemy.

It was found that during Yanukovych's time, the person involved was a mayor of Bryanka and remained in a timely occupied territory. Since 2014, he has headed the occupation administration of Bryanka. After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he agreed to a new appointment.

The SBU also exposed the former police officer, who after the release in November 2014 joined the LNR terrorist group.

In March 2022, he headed the Police Department in the occupied Novoaydar, delayed the suppression of the resistance movement and the planting of the Kremlin regime.

** The attacker has been reported suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code: **

* Part 1 of Art. 111(high treason); * h. 2 pp. 260(Participation in the activity not provided by law of armed formation).

Ще однією ворожою поплічницею виявилась мешканка тимчасово окупованогоТроїцького Луганської області.

Під час захоплення селища вона добровільно погодилась очолити «управліннябухгалтерського обліку та фінансового забезпечення» у складі місцевоїокупаційної адміністрації рф.

На цій «посаді» вона формує кошторис «бюджетних» видатків для матеріально-технічного забезпечення окупантів.

**У Херсонській області:**

викрито трьох мешканців обласного центру, які у період окупації міста обійняликерівні «посади» у створеній загарбниками «виборчій комісії».

Вони організовували проведення фейкового плебісциту щодо приєднання регіону дорф.

Для цього колаборанти відкрили «виборчі дільниці» у декількох місцевих школахі лікарнях. Далі вони «накручували» голоси на користь країни-агресора.

This procedure is stipulated by the UN Charter, signed by permanent members of the RB in 1945.
