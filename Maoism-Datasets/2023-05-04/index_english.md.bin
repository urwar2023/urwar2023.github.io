This was stated today by Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine Taras Kachka during a virtual speech on the Brussels Economic Forum, reports Ukrinform.

“The economic model of Europe should also include Ukraine. Political decision [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz)To give Ukraine the status of a candidate country should also be strengthened by economic integration, with greater access to Ukraine and the EU domestic market, which also provides additional advantages for the internal market. But when this happens too fast, it gives rise to all, and this is the situation that we now have with neighboring Member States, ”the Ukrainian official said.

He noted that sharp changes in trade policy were caused by political protests by Polish farmers, to which the Poland government responded with a purely political reaction that had a devastating effect for both the EU and Ukraine. Thanks to the intervention of the European Commission, it was somewhat facilitated by the applications, but the final decision has not yet been found.

“That is why we need to move away from political decisions that destroy economic. Last month, the decision of Poland to block Ukrainian agrarian export led to Ukraine's losses of $ 143 million, which more than the European Commission will pay Polish farmers as a compensation, the capacity of the point of view, for nowhere. Because it was in reality Blef by Polish Ferrars, and the Polish government responded to it in a very strange way, ”said Kachka.

He noted that this is exactly the case where the EU-economic policy should be used to ensure the stability of the European economy of this willingness to overcome any crisis in the future.

“And this not only applies to resistance to Russian influences. Russia has an absolutely different attitude to the economy that it wants to put under rigid political control. But such approaches will never work in Europe, they will not work in Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that open market economies the basis for ensuring stability under all conditions, including Russian aggression against Ukraine, ”the Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine emphasized.As reported, five EU countries - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania Bulgaria, - asked the European Commission to introduce protective measures against "excessive" agricultural exports from Ukraine, which affects the situation in the market, leads to a fall in prices and prices and thus affects the interests of farmers in the EU -neighboring countries with Ukraine.

On May 2, the European Commission announced a compromise solution, which provides for a prohibition of Ukrainian imports of four key farm goods-wheat, corn seeds of rapeseed rapeseed, with the simultaneous cancellation of unilateral measures of the mentioned anti-Ukrainian imports and the continuation of the Ukrainian seeds. The restrictions will be valid until June 5, and if the situation does not change, may be extended by the end of the year.

This decision was made on May 4 [](https://www.berlin.de/gerichte/verwaltungsgericht/presse/pressemitteilungen/2023/pressemitteilung.1320564.php), reports Ukrinform.

"Former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is not eligible for the office to perform current tasks," the sentence reads.

The judges noted that the plaintiff, who was Chancellor from 1998 to 2005, as well as other heads of government [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina)Before and the afternoon, he had an office in the German Bundestag, which worked the last four of the Federal Chancellor staff. However, in May 2022, the Bundestag budget committee decided to suspend the plaintiff's powers because he had no current obligations. Thus, the Berlin Administrative Court rejected the Schroeder's Position, who demanded the preservation of the office and employees.

Since the plaintiff received rooms from the SPD deputy group, not the viability of Germany.

This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to the Parliament of the Netherlands, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"The longer the taboo is about weapons, the more our warriors give life to pull out the defense when weapons are not powerful or long -range and Russian -based Russia's more effective than the aircraft of Europe's defenders. Now, all this is, unfortunately. Depends on all of us, "said [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zelenskij).

He recalled that the defense of the country, the defense of Europe is people, and therefore the decisions of the separate countries that must protect life and instead retain defense, are simply contradictory. "Defense is people. People who have weapons. More powerful weapons and a more long -range fire, the more lives are saved by detachable hostile blows. To appreciate life and to keep defense taboos with interdestations that must protect life is an obvious contradiction," Zelensky said.

"Remember that the Netherlands was the first to say that the F-16 is not a taboo. Your leadership really gives results. So we will provide new ones!" - the head of state emphasized.

Zelensky expressed his hope that during his next visit he would be able to thank the Netherlands for the defense assistance.

He also thanked the Netherlands for their leadership in Europe, through which Ukraine has reached the greatest unity in Europe, which for decades they had not been, which would not have happened without the Netherlands.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-04T16-18-00-03-00/630_360_1676811786-290.jpg)The OSCE expert name has found that the forced movement and deportation of Ukrainian children to temporarily occupied territories and/or into the territory of Russian Federation may be military crimes.

According to Ukrinform, the relevant report prepared within the framework of "Moscow Mechanism" by the OSCE, called "On violation and abuse Posted on Thursday on [](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/7/7/542751.pdf)OSCE.

The report states the fact of large -scale movement of Ukrainian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti)From the territory of Ukraine to the temporary-corresponding territories of Ukraine and to the territory of the Russian Federation itself. The basic attention in the document is given to orphans and children without accompanying, "because they are the most vulnerable groups among the moved children."

According to the report, after the transfer to the territory of the Russian Federation, Ukrainian children "are exposed to pro -Russian information campaigns, which are often total education." At the same time, the Russian Federation "does not take any steps to promote the return of Ukrainian children." And even on the contrary, it "has a variety of obstacles for families who seek to return their children."

"The mission has found that although some cases of evacuation of children are responsible for Russia under international humanitarian law, other cases of evacuation to dates without their consent, moving and prolonged placement of Ukrainian children by violation of the IGP, and in some cases are a serious violation Violation of the prohibition of forced movement or deportation in accordance with the Article of the Four Geneva Convention, "the report reads.

The mission also found that unjustified long stay or unjustified obstacles by Russian authorities violate the obligation to promote families and contradict the principles enshrined in the fourth Geneva Convention.** Read also: ** [** deportation **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3704113-rada-zaklikae-svit-zasuditi-primusovu-deportaciu-rf-ukrainskih-ditej.html)In addition, the mission concluded that the exposure of children unaccompanied to adults or similar assimilation measures "is incompatible with the Fourth -General Convention." Changing the citizenship of Ukrainian children is also an epostation of the Convention for the Protection of Civilians during the War.

"The mission also found out that the Russian belligerent side has no effective mechanism that would contribute to the reunification of Ukrainian children who are in uredia or in Russia -occupied territories, with their families. Instead, the mission will be a constant trend that testifies to that the efforts of Russian power aimed at allowing the movement of children from Ukraine of the Adult Federation do not include steps from further evacuation to third countries or more secure areas of Ukraine. The current approach , - experts said.

The document states that the Russian Federation not only repeatedly violated the interests of children, "but also denied their right to identity, the right to family, the right to associate with their family, and also violated their rights to education, access to access to Information, the right to rest, leisure, games, recreation and participation of cultural life and art, as well as the right to freedom of thought, the conscience of Tarelilia, the right to health and the right to freedom and safety. " At the same time, the aggregate of these numerous violations are very serious fears that have been erected the rights of these children to freedom from torture and the cruel treatment of such inhuman or degrading, the types of hypocryption.

"In addition, the mission concluded that the practice of forcible movement and/or deportation of Ukrainian children in temporarily occupied territories and in the territory of the Federation may be a crime against humanity in the form of" deportation or forcible movement of the population, "the report reads.** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3702246-gerasimcuk-rozpovila-u-radbezi-oon-ak-rosia-perevihovue-ukrainskih-ditej.html)The report was prepared by experts of the "Moscow mechanism" [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obse)Elina Steinerte(Latvia), Veronica(Czech Republic)and Cesilia Hellestvight(Norway)who have a great experience in international humanitarian law and human rights.

It was reported that the Moscow Mechanism is a formal procedure in Chiefshobse that allows you to deploy an independent international mission that should investigate the information about human rights violations, war crimes and anti -moments, including civilian attacks and civilian infrastructure. The members of the mission are selected from the list of experts formed by the OSCE on the basis of submission from the participating states.

The work of the mission is a report with recommendations that will help to bring the perpetrators responsible for national and international courts.

This mechanism is called "Moscow" because it was approved at the OSCE human dimension, which took place in 1991 in Moscow.

In March 2023, 45 OSCE Member States activated the "Moscow mechanism" to investigate Russia's deportation by Ukrainian children.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-04T17-22-00-03-00/630_360_1683210196-595.jpg)Belgium reassures in the process of preparing a new military assistance package for Ukraine, the mechanisms that will allow to send funds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.

Belgium Prime Minister Alexander de Kroo has announced this during a joint Zd resident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte Press Conference in Hague, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We will continue with the same effort and with the same attention to showcase with Ukraine. Now our turn to help Ukraine get rid of a hamstril and illegal occupation, which was the occupation of our country for the second world war. That is why [ ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-belgia)It is in the process of preparing a new military assistance package for Ukraine. And as we know, there are often practical obstacles in these military packages, but I can say confidently that in no Belgian heart and in any Belgian soul there is no doubt about the continuation of Ukraine, ” - he said.

The head of the Belgian government also reminded that in March last year, Belgium was arranging about 200 million euros from income from Russian assets, which were nominated in Belgium. According to him, these funds are used exclusively for assistance to the Ukrainian army and to support Ukrainian refugees in Belgium.

“And I am convinced that we can go on in this area. Not only to take away the percent, but also to look at full income from the Russian assets themselves. "At the beginning of the war, the Belgian services have frozen more than 58 billion euros of Russian Russian Central Bank. We now consider how we can fully use revenues from these Russian assets to support Ukraine in hostilities, as well as to support Ukraine's restoration," Croo became.

“I want to note that from the very beginning of this war we consider how reasonably it is to influence Russia - through the use of Russian money to restore the country it destroys. And it has a complete meaning. It makes sense of the sacrificial point of view, and even more so - from moral, ”added Prime Minister._Foto: op_

“The main purpose of the tool( [ ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-sankcii)-Rad.)It would be the maintenance of countries from the help of Russia and the suppression of trade channels that Moscow can use, ”the message reads.

If the new sanction mechanism does not work, the EU will be able to impose further targeted restrictions on key products.

"The EU also aims to expand the scope of several existing export measures to prohibit the transit of many goods through Russia," Bloomberg notes.

The new coercive mechanism will give the EU Member States the power to create a two lists: third countries that fall under sanctions and separate-forbidden goods. It will also facilitate the imposition of sanctions on companies in third countries that overlook EU sanctions.

Imports to Russia semiconductors, integral schemes and other technologies have sharpened from countries such as Kazakhstan, UAE, Turkey, China and others from the beginning of the full -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine.

According to Ukrinform, the First Deputy Chairman of the NBU Katerynazhkov in the column emphasized this [](https://www.epravda.com.ua/columns/2023/05/4/699756/).

Financial result for the past year(that was almost UAH 23 billion)and for the first quarter this year(34 llrd UAH)He gives us confidence that banks will be able to do it, ” - said.

According to her, an important element of capital recovery will be to reduce credit risks or to resolve military NPL(non -working loans). Длякредитів, що мають перспективи повернення, банки можуть провестиреструктуризацію – запропонувати позичальнику комфортніший графік повернення.

"We will have to recognize losses in order to recover them from the aggressor country. It is a long process that can last for years. But you need a clear pay, and an assessment of stability will help in its development. Ultimately, the evaluation of stability will allow to predict the return to the usual, "peaceful" banking regulation and further implementation of regulatory requirements, ”Rozhkova emphasized.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-04T23-05-00-03-00/630_360_1600426595-611.jpg)The Ukrainian Operating European Union is for the efforts to find a solution for the crisis of Ukrainian agricultural imports to neighboring countries, but this problem has yet been unknown to the final solution that should be made in the spirit of solidarity.

This was stated today by Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine Taras Kachka during a virtual speech on the Brussels Economic Forum, reports Ukrinform.

“The economic model of Europe should also include Ukraine. Political decision [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz)To give Ukraine the status of a candidate country should also be strengthened by economic integration, with greater access to Ukraine and the EU domestic market, which also provides additional advantages for the internal market. But when this happens too fast, it gives rise to all, and this is the situation that we now have with neighboring Member States, ”the Ukrainian official said.

He noted that sharp changes in trade policy were caused by political protests by Polish farmers, to which the Poland government responded with a purely political reaction that had a devastating effect for both the EU and Ukraine. Thanks to the intervention of the European Commission, it was somewhat facilitated by the applications, but the final decision has not yet been found.

“That is why we need to move away from political decisions that destroy economic. Last month, the decision of Poland to block Ukrainian agrarian export led to Ukraine's losses of $ 143 million, which more than the European Commission will pay Polish farmers as a compensation, the capacity of the point of view, for nowhere. Because it was in reality Blef by Polish Ferrars, and the Polish government responded to it in a very strange way, ”said Kachka.

He noted that this is exactly the case where the EU-economic policy should be used to ensure the stability of the European economy of this willingness to overcome any crisis in the future.

“And this not only applies to resistance to Russian influences. Russia has an absolutely different attitude to the economy that it wants to put under rigid political control. But such approaches will never work in Europe, they will not work in Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that open market economies the basis for ensuring stability under all conditions, including Russian aggression against Ukraine, ”the Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine emphasized.As reported, five EU countries - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania Bulgaria, - asked the European Commission to introduce protective measures against "excessive" agricultural exports from Ukraine, which affects the situation in the market, leads to a fall in prices and prices and thus affects the interests of farmers in the EU -neighboring countries with Ukraine.

On May 2, the European Commission announced a compromise solution, which provides for a prohibition of Ukrainian imports of four key farm goods-wheat, corn seeds of rapeseed rapeseed, with the simultaneous cancellation of unilateral measures of the mentioned anti-Ukrainian imports and the continuation of the Ukrainian seeds. The restrictions will be valid until June 5, and if the situation does not change, may be extended by the end of the year.

This decision was made on May 4 [](https://www.berlin.de/gerichte/verwaltungsgericht/presse/pressemitteilungen/2023/pressemitteilung.1320564.php), reports Ukrinform.

"Former Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is not eligible for the office to perform current tasks," the sentence reads.

The judges noted that the plaintiff, who was Chancellor from 1998 to 2005, as well as other heads of government [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina)Before and the afternoon, he had an office in the German Bundestag, which worked the last four of the Federal Chancellor staff. However, in May 2022, the Bundestag budget committee decided to suspend the plaintiff's powers because he had no current obligations. Thus, the Berlin Administrative Court rejected the Schroeder's Position, who demanded the preservation of the office and employees.

Since the plaintiff received rooms from the SPD deputy group, not the viability of Germany.

"Certificates go to the military"-this principle we form the basis of reforming the process of passing the military medical commissions. Yesterday, the Supreme Radapiditau was drafted by government officials and parliamentarians after the Nizhnarads and consultations with the participation of military and doctors.

One of them introduces electronic document flow between the military unit of Tatererial Centers of Acquisition and Social Support. The document also provides a certificate of the circumstances of the injury - now you do not need to investigate. Documents will be sent electronically to the CCC of the JV within the deadline. Quickly, easily and accessible.

The second project of the law allows you to create VLK in state and communal health care. We have already started expanding the number of VLCs in the country. Now we have a legislative basis for the creation of additional military medical commissions on the basis of civilian medical institutions. This will eliminate the queues and improve the accessibility of the process for our military.

I thank the MPs for the support of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, the military and the doctors for their direct participation in the development of documents. We continue the DIABLALIZATION OF SERVICES AND Elimination of Unnecessary Bureaucracy.

Within the framework of the survey, the motivation of military personnel to the Urosian service was investigated, as well as a subjective assessment of the conditions of service. The strongest factor that motivated the respondents to the service was the "desire of life stability" —54.8% assigned the maximum assessment(5 out of 5), and "the opportunity to advance" - 35.9%.

- That is, not the love of the Motherland, not even trust in propaganda or love of Doputin, Skabev, Soloviev, but the desire of "life stability". It is an approximate character that the Ukrainian defense forces face when we speak the conduct of the Ukrainian territories. In particular, it explains painting and other crimes. For these characters, the service in the army is the insecurity of the Motherland, not even the release of any conditional Russian -speaking as Russian propaganda, but their own life stability, opportunity to admit in life, - said Andrey Yusov.

At the same time, they did not find support from the respondents such statements "The desire to take revenge on comrades" and "the desire to be a professional military".

In the Hague, the head of our country made a speech of representatives of the International Criminal Court in the Hague.

The slogan of the speech: "No peace without justice for Ukraine".

According to Vladimir Zelensky, it is now necessary to stop the crime of aggression, which is due to impunity.

- We are very pleased to be on your land of freedom and justice, values, I would like to speak today. I would like to see the other Vladimir here(Putin. - _ ed._), we want to see him in the Hague. The one that deserves to be crushed for criminal acts. And this should be done here - in the capital.

I am sure that will happen when we win. And we will win not only in the bias with aggression. See how the countries of the world are united in helping Ukrainians in the defense - this is the basis of the desire to help. Feeling more than the fate of one country. It is a feeling that it is more than an anti -counter aggressor.

We have to stop the aggressive war as such. We have to stop the crime of aggression, which sometimes appears in the heads of those who are used to impunity. It is the same free door to aggression-if we look at any aggressive in history. We will see that they are united by one single thing. Those who started this did not believe that they would ever have to be responsible for the committed, they would be responsible for the war. But the war must receive condemnation.

Only a full -fledged, not hybrid peace is needed now, says Vladimirzelensky.

- The impunity of aggressors means that we need to deal with it. It is necessary to eradicate the roots of aggression.

We know that long -term peace after victory can only be achieved thanks to the sides, strong values. It is freedom, the rule of law, the need to provide full justice - not any hybrid substitutes. We cannot allow hybrid immunity. Not a hybrid peace associated with the contamination of hostilities for a certain period. But the true peace, the reality of the right is exactly what we need now, not hybrid forms.

Solution of war is an international crime that is different from the rest of the rays by the fact that it contains all the evil of other crimes.

According to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, only an effective special tribunal, such as after the Second World War, is capable of having a sentence of the antisoner.We want to continue the tradition of mandatory punishment for such crimes of aggression as a guarantee of uniqueness of such aggression. If we want justice, we are innocent to seek justifications, we should not refer to the shortcomings of the current international law. Instead, we must make bold decisions that will correct the shortcomings, which, unfortunately, exist in international law.

The constancy of peace arises as a result of full justice, including a lesion against the aggressor. The aggressor must feel the fullness of justice against it is our historical responsibility.

We need to have a true, complete tribunal, true full -time, - said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The changes are dictated by the fact that during the legal regime of the military, the need to stay citizens on military accounting of conscripts up to 27 years.

Secondly, prolonged military registration of conscripts during the action of the war, leads to the fact that a significant number of citizens who do not have the status of military service cannot be unrelated to military service during mobilization.

Considering the considerable attention of society to issues related to the military and mobilization, it is worth noting that all initiatives of Ukraine's siloboplants aimed at strengthening the defense capability of the state, are grounded, agreed with other governmental and security structures, aiming to win the process of winning. !

About it [writes](https://t.me/annamaliar/698)In her Telegram-channel of the Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Anna Malyar.

It is a directional, well -designed, large -scale campaign that they implemented generously in 2014 as one of the elements of cooking for war.

They now use certification to strengthen their criminal regimen of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.

There are two ways to act in two ways:

1️. Encouraged, inducing our citizens in temporarily occupied territories to find an initiative and get a passport.

2 \. They are intimidated, threatened with massacre and physically force the Russian passport.

At the same time, the Russian authorities conceal the following information:

* The obtained Russian passport legalizes the violent actions of the Russian Federation against the citizen, since in part in the Russian Federation such violence is allowed by law. Yes, it is a violation of international law, but the existence of a Russian passport de facto deprives Ukraine and the international community of effective assistance. * The Russian authorities distribute passports not to protect people or save their lives. * The Russian authorities seek to protect themselves and make repression against Ukrainians - legitimate.

In addition, the Russian passport enemy uses for:

* forced mobilization of our people to the ranks of the hostile army; * Use of passport data in falsifying the results of the so -called elections in temporarily occupied territories.
