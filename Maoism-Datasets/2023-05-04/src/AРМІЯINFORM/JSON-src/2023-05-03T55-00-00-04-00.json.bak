The correct useof terms plays a very important role in explaining for the global audiencewhat is happening in Ukraine now – the Russian occupiers are committinggenocide against the Ukrainian nation.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine prepared the glossary on Russianaggression against Ukraine. It could be useful for foreign media, think tanksand governments. For a long period of time, state aggressor, the RussianFederation and before Russian empire and Soviet Union promoted the narrativesabout Ukraine as a failed state, Ukrainian as artificial language and thesisabout Russians and Ukrainians as the one nation. Therefore, we have to explainforeigners how to use terms correctly.\n\nWe bring to your attention the glossary «Correct terminology on Russianaggression against Ukraine»:\n\nCorrect Terminology on Russian Aggression Against Ukraine:\n\nINCORRECT / WRONG / RUSSIAN NARRATIVE | CORRECT | NOTES  ---|---|---  The Ukraine, in the Ukraine | Ukraine / in Ukraine | According to theConstitution of Ukraine and the UN language.  Ukraine crisis / Ukraine conflict / War in Ukraine / Russian War in Ukraine |Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine / Russia’s war against Ukraine /Russia’s aggression against Ukraine | Russia’s full-scale military invasion ofUkraine in February 2022 became the expansion of Russia’s aggression againstUkraine that has been ongoing since February 2014.  Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine | Russia’s unprovoked full-scale military invasion of Ukraine started in 2022 (in continuation ofRussia’s aggression against Ukraine that has been ongoing since February2014). |  Russian liberation / Russian liberators | Russian occupation / Russianoccupation army / Russian invaders |  Ukraine was part of Russia | Ukraine and Russia were parts of the Soviet Union|  Mostly Russian-speaking east of Ukraine is culturally/mentally closer toRussia | Speaking Russian does not mean being culturally / mentally closer toRussia. Russian-speaking Ukrainians represent a legacy of Russian colonialismand long-term policy of Russification | including as a result of policies oflanguage substitution and population replacement that the Russian empire andthe USSR have pursued for over three centuries.  Ukraine’s attacks on Crimea / Russian Crimea | Ukraine’s legitimate efforts tode-occupy Crimea, which is a part of Ukraine’s sovereign territory within theinternationally recognized borders. | The Autonomous Republic of Crimea andthe city of Sevastopol, parts of Ukraine’s territory, have been temporarilyoccupied by the Russian Federation since 20 February 2014.  War in Ukraine is not a genocide. (If so, then every war is a genocide) |Russia’s war in Ukraine is genocidal by all indications. | Russia’s war isgenocidal in conception and is genocidal in practice. One major sign thatRussia is committing genocide is that systematic violence is perpetuatedagainst not only male civilians, but against women, children, and the elderly.Russia has shown an “annihilating mindset” by attacking civilians who areevacuating and forcing people  |  | into “filtration” camps. The forcible transfer of children to anothergroup — by having them reeducated or adopted by Russians — violates theGenocide Convention. Among other violations of the Genocide Convention are thecontinued denigration of the history and identity of Ukrainian people as ajustification for war and hatred, attacks on Ukrainian museums, churches, andlibraries. Russia’s discourse about the war also allegedly violates a specifictenet of the Genocide Convention: making false allegations of genocide. Beforethe full-scaled aggression, Putin and the Kremlin have falsely accused Ukraineitself of committing genocide against ethnic Russians, declaring Ukrainians tobe “Nazis,” and used that claim as a pretext to justify its invasion.  Russian officials in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions |Representatives of the Russian occupation administration in the temporarilyoccupied parts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions ofUkraine. |  Annexed regions of Ukraine | Temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine |  Annexation of regions of Ukraine | Temporary occupation and attemptedannexation of territories of Ukraine |  Kyiv government | Government of Ukraine / Ukrainian government |  By supplying weapons to Ukraine, Western countries only prolong the conflict |Ukraine has the inherent right of individual or collective self-defenseaccording to Article 51 of the UN Charter. Supplies of weapons to Ukraine,which defends itself against Russia’s war of aggression, are legal and do notrequire Russia’s consent. The sooner Ukraine receives required number ofweapons and defeats Russia on the battlefield, the sooner Russia’s war ofaggression ends and peace returns to Europe. |  Russia attacks legitimate military targets | Russia’s war of aggressionagainst Ukraine is infringement of the international law. Russia deliberatelyattacks not only military positions, but residential areas and criticalcivilian infrastructure such as power stations as well. |  Sanctions against Russia caused food and energy crises | Russia’s war ofaggression against Ukraine caused food and energy crises.  Sanctions are necessary to undermine Russia’s ability to finance its war ofaggression against Ukraine.Stronger sanctions will force Russia to end its warof aggression against Ukraine. | Ukrainian food export was severely underminedby Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian sea ports, causing food shortage and highprices across the globe. The rise of energy prices was brought by actions ofRussia, which cut supplies to Europe even before the sanctions took effect.  Russia conducts evacuations of civilians from the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhanskand Zaporizhzhia regions | Russia conducts forced transfers and deportationsof civilians from the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. |These are international crimes according to International Humanitarian Law.  Russia held referendums in Ukraine’s regions | Russia held sham (null andvoid, unlawful) “referendums” in the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraineunder the barrel of a gun. |  Russia invited foreign observers to its referendums in Ukraine | Russia’soccupation administrations invited puppet/marginal “foreign observers” loyalto the Kremlin during sham “referendums” |  Russia’s mobilization campaign in Crimea and former Ukrainian oblasts |Russia’s unlawful mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the parts of sovereignterritory of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by Russia. | Under the GenevaConventions of 12 August 1949, the occupying Power is prohibited to compelprotected persons to serve in its armed or auxiliary forces.  Russia’s passportization campaign in Crimea and former Ukrainian oblasts |Russia’s unlawful passportization of Ukrainian citizens in the parts ofsovereign territory of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by Russia. |  Putin was provoked to hit back for the Crimea Bridge explosion | Putinunleashes missile terror on residential areas and critical civilianinfrastructure of Ukraine before and after explosion on the Crimea Bridge. Hisonly goal is to undermine our resolve to defend ourselves, destroy andsubordinate Ukraine. | Russia had been constantly hitting Ukraine withmissiles before and after the Crimea bridge explosions. Shifting the blame onthe victim of aggression by suggesting that Putin “responds” or is being“provoked” is totally misleading.  Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb | Ukraine has never developed nuclearbombs after it gave up its nuclear arsenal in the 90s / Russia may use fakenews about Ukraine’s |  Ukraine is conducting a joint military biological activities with the UnitedStates aimed at developing biological weapons at medical and biologicalfacilities situated in Ukraine | dirty bomb to cover up its false flag nuclearincident. As it was confirmed by the IAEA Director General: “technical andscientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign ofundeclared nuclear activities and materials”\n\nUkraine has never conducted any military and biological activities, includingits own territory. Ukraine has never developed biological weapons and does nothave any specialized facilities for this purpose.\n\nSuch facilities had only existed on the territory of the former USSR withinthe borders of the Russian Federation which inherited the correspondinginfrastructure and facilities.\n\nAll medical and biological facilities of Ukraine are used for peacefulpurposes only to strengthen its own biosecurity.\n\nRussia may spread fake narratives about so called “military and biologicalactivities in Ukraine” to cover up its a false flag biological incident. |  Russians are out of politics / alienated from politics / cannot influencepolitics | Russians profess political indifference/apathy and thus maintainimplicit consent with Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine, Syria, Chechnya, Africanstates etc. |  Ordinary Russians are not responsible for Russia’s crimes | Every Russian isresponsible for Russia’s crimes in Ukraine as long as they support Putin’sregime and its actions. | The Russian Public Opinion Research Center publisheddata that at least 68% of Russians support the actions of the Russian regime.The poll was conducted during January 2023.  Ukraine does not want peace | Ukraine, like no other, wants peace. Presidentof Ukraine proposed Peace Formula of 10 points to reach a comprehensive, justand lasting peace, in line with the principles of the UN Charter, and |  | based on the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity ofUkraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to itsterritorial waters. |  There is a need of ceasefire and peace talks | Ceasefire without withdrawingof Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine will only give possibility toRussia for rest and new attack.\n\nPeace talks without withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukrainewill lead to conservation of the temporarily occupation of Ukrainianterritories by Russia and will be used by Russia for new attack later.\n\nRussia is an aggressor and Ukraine is a victim of aggression. That is why anyproposals for the peace talks should be based on understanding that the onlyway to the comprehensive, just and lasting peace is full restoration ofUkraine’s territorial integrity and punishment of Russia for its crime ofaggression. | Ukraine invites all countries to participate in the PeaceFormula proposed by President Zelenskyy, which corresponds to the UNGAresolution “UN Charter principles underlying a comprehensive, just and lastingpeace in Ukraine” of 23.02.2023, supported by 141 country.\n\nAny peace initiative should be based on the above-mentioned Resolution.
