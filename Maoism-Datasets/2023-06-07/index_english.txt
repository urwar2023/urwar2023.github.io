Due to the entry into the North Atlantic Alliance of Finland and in view of the further expansion of NATO, it discusses the expansion of headquarters in Brussels and reorganization of premises.
According to NATO's four diplomats, the Alliance building in Brussels, opened in 2018, becomes too small to place delegations of future Member States.
"Finland's moving to NATO headquarters will end with the next weeks of the IIsyans," one of the Alliance officials confirmed, adding that it will be samosted with Sweden, "when it becomes a full member of NATO."
But the problem is that none of the new delegations in the current construction building will fit.
Currently, the delegations of Finland, Sweden and other partner countries are located the NATO Early Headquarters-an old complex built during the Cold War, across the road on Leopold III Boulevard. It is currently used to place delegations of partner countries.
Since NATO enlargement has occurred faster than predicted, now the Alliances are finding a solution that would allow Finland and its future faith of 50 people to move to the headquarters building.
One of the decisions of the Alliance is the construction of additional construction in the territory of the NATO military town, where its international employees and agencies could accommodate. This solution is proposed as a temporary but quick solution.
At the same time, the problem is the cost of construction, because for the construction of a new headquarters, the Alliance has already paid 1.1 billion euros.

More than 19.5 thousand children, according to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russia exported its territory from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. In this she served as statements about their "salvation", and for Ukraine chose the tacticusylyako to be blamed as such acting against the interests of Ukrainian children. Manipulations, misinformation, attempt to shift responsibility for Ukraine's other countries, conscious violation of international law and active involvement Thoughts in support of their unlawful politics - this is what the National Council revealed when monitoring Russian resources on the deportation of Ukrainian children. The media larger prepared the reporting with the results of his work, which relied not only on monitoring data, but also on the legal basis, including the international, in this matter.
About it reports press service National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting.
Monitoring has covered Russian state TV channels("Planet RTR", "Russia 24", "NTV-MI", "360"), online media(Izvestia, Moscow Komsomolets, Vesti.ru, RIA, Radio Sputnik, Vedomosti, Parliamentary Gazeta, AiF, Kommersant, Lenta.ru, TASS , "Sm.news", "Bloknot.ru", "Public Service of News")and the online version of the Radio Sputnik radio station for the period from a full-scale invasion to May 2023. The National Programs and news messages were taken into account.
 Data from open sources, mainly from the EUVSDISINFO resource, and materials of research institutes, expert groups, authorized international representatives and missions, were used to refute narratives and misinformation. Human rights, puzzle crimes against humanity, related to the forced movement and/or deportation of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation.From the point of view of international law, deportation of children is one of the six serious orders against children in the face of military conflicts. The UN Security Council approved the UN 1261 of the UN in 1999, which described six serious violations against children during armed conflict. These violations are released from the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, international human rights, and Geneva Conventions(inclusive protocols to them), Roman Statute and the Convention on Rights [3]. Therefore, when Russia performs the abduction or admiration of children, it is toponed the Geneva Conventions, and commits war crimes and anti -moments.
The first report on how Russia exports to its territory Ukrainian children appeared in the Russian media on February 21, 2022. Further such reports on "evacuation", rehabilitation and adoption or "design" of Ukrainian children in Russian families, their upbringing(In fact, re -education)Information in Russian information regularly.
 The analysis of Russian media resources made it possible to evaluate the pattern of stories of the Russian media in the context of deportation of children and determine their intelligence and systematicity.
Yes, it is clear that 
Транслюють позицію російської держави офіційні посадовці. З допомогою ЗМІ воничасто поширюють неправдиву інформацію, формують наративи для виправдання своєїполітики і формування лояльного ставлення російського народу до депортаціїукраїнських дітей і будь-яких дій російського уряду щодо цього. Це сприяєпідтримці політики депортації Росією не лише у межах самої російськоїфедерації, але й на тих територіях, де досі працюють або на які поширюють своюдіяльність російські медіа. Тому російські медіа — це співучасники злочинноїдіяльності рф у контексті депортації дітей, оскільки вони підтримують іпоглиблюють злочинну депортацію.
In general, in the rhetoric of Russian high -ranking officials, the justification of the criminal deportation of Ukrainian children is due to the formation of the idea that Russia actually has only good intentions and seeks to save Ukrainian children with the renovated threat - Nazism and/or fascism.

 In addition, significant efforts are made by Russian officials and the media in order to blacken the western countries(mainly in Europe and the United States). Так, післявидання Міжнародним кримінальним судом ордеру на арешт президента росії в.путіна саме через депортацію українських дітей, російські ЗМІ почали ширитиповідомлення в дусі конспірологічних «змовницьких» теорій про те, що беззаступництва росії українські діти потрапили би або до рук європейськихпедофілів, або чорних трансплантологів.
Було виділено такі наративи російської пропаганди в контексті депортаціїукраїнських дітей росією: 
In the report on the monitoring of the National Council, some units have been submitted to such topics in Russian propaganda, such as adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian families and abrasion of national identity of Ukrainian children. The regulator came to the conclusion about the obvious and in fact confirmed by the deportation and abrasion of the national identity of Ukrainian children. That is why the term "forced deportation" should be used in the context of the export of Ukrainian children.
According to the results of monitoring and analyzing materials of the Russian change council the following conclusions: 
 Distributed by Russian officials and media information is a predominant depository, which in all cases either discredit Ukraine and its allies, or justifies Russia's actions in the context of deportation of children, or resorts to these two techniques at the same time. The reception of the dichotomy "My-Vona" in the Russian information environment of Ukrainian children is typical of warning the waters and propaganda of war.
The Russian media form an information isolated from objective reality, in which Russia plays the role of a state that "saves" and acts good, Aukraine and Western countries that oppose Russia is evil. This prevents Russian citizens from reliable information, encourages civilian populations of the Russian Federation to commit even more violent atrocities against Ukrainians, introduces from the fuzzy consumers of Russian media in the territories abroad, where the Russian media signal is accessible.
The justification of deportation of Ukrainian children by Russian media is a further encouragement of genocide of the Ukrainian people, which indicates the involvement of legal(Media)and individuals for crimes committed by an aggressor state, in particular to genocide.

 A report prepared on the results of the Analysis of the Russian Media conducted by the National Council, taking into account the norms of international law, was ordered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada, Advisor - the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for the Rights of the Child and Pediatric Rehabilitation, International Organizations.

Ця війна почалася не минулого року, вонапочалася набагато раніше – у 2014-му. Коли ця війна завершиться, нам будутьнеобхідні рамкові заходи, щоб історія не повторилася, і щоб президент Путін неміг надалі шахраювати з європейською безпекою», - сказав Столтенберг.
Він зауважив, що головною гарантією безпеки для НАТО There is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty Collective Defense and full membership.

NATO doors remain open ... All allies agreed that Ukraine would be a member of the Alliance - it was released again and again, the last time - during the Madrid summit in June year. Everyone agreed: it is a matter of Ukraine and allies - to decide when the right time will come to invite Ukraine to full membership. This is not about Moscow. Putin has no veto on expansion, ”the Alliance head emphasized.
He recalled again that NATO's most difficult task is to ensure that President Putin does not win this war so that Ukraine would win.He emphasized the need to maintain the unity of allies in the Ukrainian assistance in the fight against the Russian invasion, and thanked the United States for the leadership in mobilizing such assistance as from NATO allies, such from partner countries around the world.

In 2021, these systems provided irrigation by 584 thousand hectares, of which about 4 million tons of grain and oil crops were painted, worth about $ 1.5mlrd.
In 2023, only 13 irrigation systems operate on the right bank of the Dnieper. Terrorist act on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station actually left 94% of irrigation systems in Kherson, 74% in Zaporizhzhia and 30% - in the Dnieper regions. The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station will lead to the fact that the Polyana South of Ukraine can turn into a desert next year. Not only agrarians and water users, but the sources of drinking water supply of settlements, will be affected by the Bezkakhov reservoir.
 The negative effects of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station will also be for the fisheries. The death of fish both young and adults is already recorded. The spawning period has ended and as a result of falling water levels, caviar dried names.
In addition, the Fauna water flow of the reservoir into the floodplains formed by the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant will also die. Since in the future, when the "flood" wave is reduced, these bioresurses will be on land.
Another problem will be the ingress and death of freshwater fish and other bioresurses into the salty waters of the Black Sea. The Black Sea fauna of the disgraceful influx of fresh water may also die.
 The negative effects of devastation of aquatic bioresources will be traced for several years in a row, even when filling the bed of the Kakhovsky water storage in the near future. Since the renewal of quantitative and qualitative composition of fish populations, the restoration of bottom coenoses of the forage base requires long.
We emphasize that all data are given only by preliminary estimates. The final ones can only be done when the water level stabilizes. ”

 The greatest damage due to the undermining by Russian invaders of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station threatens to electric grid.
According to Ukrinform, Alexander Sergienko, Director of the Analytical and Research Center "Institute of City" informed Ukrainian Radio .
"Коли заливає підвали чи перші поверхи, то страждають несучі конструкції,стіни, підлога, меблі. Якщо йдеться не про хатину початку ХХ століття, тонічого з фундаментами не станеться. Можуть бути зовнішні пошкодження настінах, можуть відійти шпалери, але якщо є цегляні стіни й бетонні фундаменти,то навряд чи станеться щось критичне. Комунікаціям є загроза, особливо електричним networks, "he said.
According to the expert, there will be nothing to the water pipes and gas pipes, although they will probably have to be blown. Instead, electrical contacts, where possible, threaten significant damage.
Pumping stations in the basements can also be damaged.

"Because there are pumps everywhere, electricity works everywhere, and if you do not turn off - it will be a short closure and everything will just be burned. Second - do not forget that it will come down or late because it will spread. Everything will depend on how much water has penetrated into the system Water supply, gas supply, in variations, other mechanisms, " - said the expert.
In his opinion, it is quite realistic to restore the working condition of all units, because water is not an aggressive fluid, although oxidation is likely.
Yes, if the nodes are made qualitatively, when the water comes down, they will need to be a little overwhelmed, cleaned and lubricated. "The faster the water goes down, the easier it will be. It is difficult to predict," Sergienko added.

Ця війна почалася не минулого року, вонапочалася набагато раніше – у 2014-му. Коли ця війна завершиться, нам будутьнеобхідні рамкові заходи, щоб історія не повторилася, і щоб президент Путін неміг надалі шахраювати з європейською безпекою», - сказав Столтенберг.
Він зауважив, що головною гарантією безпеки для НАТО There is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty Collective Defense and full membership.

“Certainly, it is too early to anticipate the results of Vilnius -Samite on this issue in advance, but the Allies have already agreed with many important -speakers concerning Ukraine and its path to membership. NATO doors remain open ... All allies agreed that Ukraine would be a member of the Alliance - it was released again and again, the last time - during the Madrid summit in June year. Everyone agreed: it is a matter of Ukraine and allies - to decide when the right time will come to invite Ukraine to full membership. This is not about Moscow. Putin has no veto on expansion, ”the Alliance head emphasized.
He recalled again that NATO's most difficult task is to ensure that President Putin does not win this war so that Ukraine would win.He emphasized the need to maintain the unity of allies in the Ukrainian assistance in the fight against the Russian invasion, and thanked the United States for the leadership in mobilizing such assistance as from NATO allies, such from partner countries around the world.

Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians! 
Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!
Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.
But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.
Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.
Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.
But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.
Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!We also called for the departure of an international observation mission to Kakhovka, to replace the units and all structures of the station. Unfortunately, world attention was not enough to provide all this. We now need to concentrate the world for the treatment of the consequences of another disaster due to the fault of Russia, we must prevent the more destructive activity of the invaders.
He spent some important international conversations today.
Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.
Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, Ukraine's de -occupation is a tasks.
France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.
Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.
Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.
First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. The sustainability of supply is the main principle.
Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhya, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to have been solved by the occupiers.
Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all are involved to the maximum to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!
And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.

 Pubrunction of people in the occupied part of the Kherson region, who have suffered as a result of the heating of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plants by Russian aggressors, should immediately involve international organizations, including the ICRC.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in video closer , reports Ukrinform.
Video: Presidential Office 
Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians! 
Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!
Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.
But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.
Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.
Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.
But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.
Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!We also called for the departure of an international observation mission to Kakhovka, to replace the units and all structures of the station. Unfortunately, world attention was not enough to provide all this. We now need to concentrate the world for the treatment of the consequences of another disaster due to the fault of Russia, we must prevent the more destructive activity of the invaders.
He spent some important international conversations today.
Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.
Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, Ukraine's de -occupation is a tasks.
France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.
Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.
Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.
First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. The sustainability of supply is the main principle.
Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhya, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to have been solved by the occupiers.
Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all are involved to the maximum to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!
And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.
Glory to all our heroes! 
Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians! 
Glory to Ukraine!

 The SBU reported suspicion to 7 more to fireolaborators: among them - a colleague, who called on the Crimean to join the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, informs пресслужба відомства.
«Служба безпеки задокументувала злочинну діяльність ще 7 чиновників-колаборантів, які переховуються на тимчасово окупованій території України.Однією з них є очільниця створеної агресором „адміністрації Чорноморськогорайону Криму“ Наталія Пісарєва. Її кандидатуру на це „крісло“ нещодавноособисто погодив місцевий гауляйтер Аксьонов. До цього призначення Пісарєвабула так званою „першою заступницею міністра культури“ на тимчасовозахопленому півострові», — йдеться у повідомленні.
Зазначається, що перебуваючи на цій «посаді», після початку повномасштабноговторгнення вона координувала ворожу інформкампанію щодо підтримки збройноїагресії рф. Тоді фігурантка публічно закликала українських захисниківздаватися в полон, а також агітувала мешканців Криму вступати до російськихвійськ для війни проти України. За це окупаційний «військовий комісаріатКриму» нагородив її грамотою.
За даними слідства, до захоплення українського півострова Пісарєва керуваларегіональним проєктним офісом апарату Ради міністрів автономної республіки.Однак, під час його захоплення підтримала агресора і згодом увійшла до такзваного кадрового резерву окупаційної адміністрації.
Ще однією колаборанткою є колишня посадовиця Управління Державноїказначейської служби України в Луганській області. Після захоплення частинирегіону вона добровільно погодилась на «пропозицію» агресора очолити так зване«казначейство лнр».
До «штату» псевдоустанови вона залучила ще п’ятьох спільників. Ними виявилисьїї колишні підлеглі зі Старобільського, Новоайдарського, Міловського,Новопсковського та Марківського районів. У складі окупаційного органу вонистали керівниками відповідних районних «управлінь казначейської служби лнр».На цих «посадах» вони брали участь у фінансовому забезпеченні російськихокупаційних угруповань, які були задіяні на східному фронті.

 During countertoing measures, a Russian agent was exposed in Dnipropetrovsk, who collected for Russian invaders about the types and number of heavens of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, as well as their place of departure.
About it reports Security Service of Ukraine.
He also handed over to the invaders of the location of the territorial centers of staffing and social support(military enlistment offices)and tried to identify rail lines involved in the supply of ammunition to the front. For each task, the Russian agent received from his "curator" from the FSB to 4 thousand hryvnias. For conspiracy the money was transferred by the traitor with the help of a cryptocurrency electronic wallet.
Intelligence information was needed to prepare the series of air strikes in the region, first of all for the defeat of strategic objects.
According to the investigation, a local resident was detained, who was a staffing officer of the FSB in July 2022. In the field of view of the Russian special service, he got through one of the Russian telegrams, where he periodically launched a photo of the positions of Ukrainian troops.
In the future, he maintained connection with the aggressor through the messenger. To perform the intelligence he went to the area where he was hidden watching the objects, and also asked the information he needed from people.

Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians! 
Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!
Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.
But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.
Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.
Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.
But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.
Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!
Together, we must also hold the occupiers. They have more than a year controlled both the dam and the whole hydroelectric power station. Russian propagandists seriously and openly developing such a scenario of the man -made catastrophe they have reported. Last autumn, we warned the world about the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.He spent some important international conversations today.
Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.
Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, the de -occupation of Ukraine is a tasks.
France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.
Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.
Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.
First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. Supply is the main principle.
Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to solve the problems.
Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all to the maximum are involved to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!
And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.
Bakhmut direction, Avdiivka, all "Khortytsia", all "Tavriya" - you are good!
Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.
Glory to all our heroes!
Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!
