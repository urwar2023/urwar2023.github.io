Due to the entry into the North Atlantic Alliance of Finland and in view of the further expansion of NATO, it discusses the expansion of headquarters in Brussels and reorganization of premises.

According to NATO's four diplomats, the Alliance building in Brussels, opened in 2018, becomes too small to place delegations of future Member States.

"Finland's moving to NATO headquarters will end with the next weeks of the IIsyans," one of the Alliance officials confirmed, adding that it will be samosted with Sweden, "when it becomes a full member of NATO."

But the problem is that none of the new delegations in the current construction building will fit.

Currently, the delegations of Finland, Sweden and other partner countries are located the NATO Early Headquarters-an old complex built during the Cold War, across the road on Leopold III Boulevard. It is currently used to place delegations of partner countries.

Since NATO enlargement has occurred faster than predicted, now the Alliances are finding a solution that would allow Finland and its future faith of 50 people to move to the headquarters building.

One of the decisions of the Alliance is the construction of additional construction in the territory of the NATO military town, where its international employees and agencies could accommodate. This solution is proposed as a temporary but quick solution.

At the same time, the problem is the cost of construction, because for the construction of a new headquarters, the Alliance has already paid 1.1 billion euros.

- The military command also had a warning that the critical level, according to experts, can reach water in about 5 hours. It is not necessary to wait all these 5 hours. You should already be aware that if the area falls under the flooding area, most likely you need to consume already. To take appropriate things, documents, not to panic and understand that all services work and, of course, their efforts will be directed to the population.

- Again the attack by aviation, again from the direction of Caspian. And he used the enemy Tirakets, which he could still afford-X-101/555. The vast majority of all was directed in the direction of Kyiv and Central Ukraine. This indicates that the enemy will continue such attacks. Marine rocket launchers were not involved before the attack itself were re -brought to the base points, which may indicate that the occupiers now do not have the potential of the "caliber" that they could apply. But it is too early to relax, we need to be aware that they will continue to terrorize us, in particular, and the rear regions.

More than 19.5 thousand children, according to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russia exported its territory from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. In this she served as statements about their "salvation", and for Ukraine chose the tacticusylyako to be blamed as such acting against the interests of Ukrainian children. Manipulations, misinformation, attempt to shift responsibility for Ukraine's other countries, conscious violation of international law and active involvement Thoughts in support of their unlawful politics - this is what the National Council revealed when monitoring Russian resources on the deportation of Ukrainian children. The media larger prepared the reporting with the results of his work, which relied not only on monitoring data, but also on the legal basis, including the international, in this matter.

About it reports [press service](http://www.nrada.gov.ua/yaka-vidpovidalnist-rosijskyh-zmi-za-deportatsiyu-ukrayinskyh-ditej-analiz-natsionalnoyi-rady/?fbclid=IwAR38fBW-K4Iikigy1fEG-rnsu2Jox9Y2W0UR43qpc8hkpvjPb2Gvrbv56wM)National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting.

Monitoring has covered Russian state TV channels("Planet RTR", "Russia 24", "NTV-MI", "360"), online media(Izvestia, Moscow Komsomolets, Vesti.ru, RIA, Radio Sputnik, Vedomosti, Parliamentary Gazeta, AiF, Kommersant, Lenta.ru, TASS , "Sm.news", "Bloknot.ru", "Public Service of News")and the online version of the Radio Sputnik radio station for the period from a full-scale invasion to May 2023. The National Programs and news messages were taken into account.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T47-00-00-04-00/deportation-3-scaled.jpg)Data from open sources, mainly from the EUVSDISINFO resource, and materials of research institutes, expert groups, authorized international representatives and missions, were used to refute narratives and misinformation. Human rights, puzzle crimes against humanity, related to the forced movement and/or deportation of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation.From the point of view of international law, deportation of children is one of the six serious orders against children in the face of military conflicts. The UN Security Council approved the UN 1261 of the UN in 1999, which described six serious violations against children during armed conflict. These violations are released from the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, international human rights, and Geneva Conventions(inclusive protocols to them), Roman Statute and the Convention on Rights [3]. Therefore, when Russia performs the abduction or admiration of children, it is toponed the Geneva Conventions, and commits war crimes and anti -moments.

The first report on how Russia exports to its territory Ukrainian children appeared in the Russian media on February 21, 2022. Further such reports on "evacuation", rehabilitation and adoption or "design" of Ukrainian children in Russian families, their upbringing(In fact, re -education)Information in Russian information regularly.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T47-00-00-04-00/deportation-4-scaled.jpg)The analysis of Russian media resources made it possible to evaluate the pattern of stories of the Russian media in the context of deportation of children and determine their intelligence and systematicity.

** Yes, it is clear that **

* 15 out of 20, the media monitoring and analysis of the media, which justifies Russia's misconduct in the context of deportation of Ukrainian children; * 11 out of 20 - disseminated information that discredits Ukraine in the context of protecting Ukrainian children from the consequences of war and deportation; * 17 out of 20-disseminated information that discredit Western powers, allies of Ukraine and partner organizations in the context of protection against the consequences of war; * 10 out of 20 - resorted to the dissemination of information in all the directions given(discredited Ukraine, Western countries and justified the actions of).

Транслюють позицію російської держави офіційні посадовці. З допомогою ЗМІ воничасто поширюють неправдиву інформацію, формують наративи для виправдання своєїполітики і формування лояльного ставлення російського народу до депортаціїукраїнських дітей і будь-яких дій російського уряду щодо цього. Це сприяєпідтримці політики депортації Росією не лише у межах самої російськоїфедерації, але й на тих територіях, де досі працюють або на які поширюють своюдіяльність російські медіа. Тому російські медіа — це співучасники злочинноїдіяльності рф у контексті депортації дітей, оскільки вони підтримують іпоглиблюють злочинну депортацію.

In general, in the rhetoric of Russian high -ranking officials, the justification of the criminal deportation of Ukrainian children is due to the formation of the idea that Russia actually has only good intentions and seeks to save Ukrainian children with the renovated threat - Nazism and/or fascism.

[![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T47-00-00-04-00/deportation-5-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/deportation-5-scaled.jpg)In addition, significant efforts are made by Russian officials and the media in order to blacken the western countries(mainly in Europe and the United States). Так, післявидання Міжнародним кримінальним судом ордеру на арешт президента росії в.путіна саме через депортацію українських дітей, російські ЗМІ почали ширитиповідомлення в дусі конспірологічних «змовницьких» теорій про те, що беззаступництва росії українські діти потрапили би або до рук європейськихпедофілів, або чорних трансплантологів.

**Було виділено такі наративи російської пропаганди в контексті депортаціїукраїнських дітей росією:**

* викрадення Росією українських дітей — абсурдна містифікація;  * ордер на арешт, виданий МКС (International Criminal Court)Against Putin, she puts new challenges to the chances of peace; * The Secret Society of Pedophiles Awesters Putin under the ISS Order; * The ISS warrant was issued for the arrest of Putin because Western sanctions do not work; * The evacuation of children from Ukraine occurs in accordance with humanitarian law.

In the report on the monitoring of the National Council, some units have been submitted to such topics in Russian propaganda, such as adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian families and abrasion of national identity of Ukrainian children. The regulator came to the conclusion about the obvious and in fact confirmed by the deportation and abrasion of the national identity of Ukrainian children. That is why the term "forced deportation" should be used in the context of the export of Ukrainian children.

** According to the results of monitoring and analyzing materials of the Russian change council the following conclusions: **

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T47-00-00-04-00/deportation-8-scaled.jpg)Distributed by Russian officials and media information is a predominant depository, which in all cases either discredit Ukraine and its allies, or justifies Russia's actions in the context of deportation of children, or resorts to these two techniques at the same time. The reception of the dichotomy "My-Vona" in the Russian information environment of Ukrainian children is typical of warning the waters and propaganda of war.

The Russian media form an information isolated from objective reality, in which Russia plays the role of a state that "saves" and acts good, Aukraine and Western countries that oppose Russia is evil. This prevents Russian citizens from reliable information, encourages civilian populations of the Russian Federation to commit even more violent atrocities against Ukrainians, introduces from the fuzzy consumers of Russian media in the territories abroad, where the Russian media signal is accessible.

The justification of deportation of Ukrainian children by Russian media is a further encouragement of genocide of the Ukrainian people, which indicates the involvement of legal(Media)and individuals for crimes committed by an aggressor state, in particular to genocide.

“The question is about security guarantees or certificates and future membership(Ukraine in NATO - ed.). Тому що, коли ця війна завершиться, ми маємозабезпечити, щоб це не була якась пауза, протягом якої президент Путін зможевідпочити, переформуватися та розгорнути свої сили для ще однієї атаки, як мице бачили протягом багатьох років. Ця війна почалася не минулого року, вонапочалася набагато раніше – у 2014-му. Коли ця війна завершиться, нам будутьнеобхідні рамкові заходи, щоб історія не повторилася, і щоб президент Путін неміг надалі шахраювати з європейською безпекою», - сказав Столтенберг.

Він зауважив, що головною гарантією безпеки для [ НАТО](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)There is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty Collective Defense and full membership. Discussions are currently underway on the provision of security guarantees for Ukraine, in particular, at the level of bilateral relations with some of the allies. Consultations between the Allies, how to respond to Ukraine's aspirations in NATO, were also continuing, it was this topic that was a major meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the country with Oslo during a recent meeting of Foreign Ministers.

“Certainly, it is too early to anticipate the results of Vilnius -Samite on this issue in advance, but the Allies have already agreed with many important -speakers concerning Ukraine and its path to membership. NATO doors remain open ... All allies agreed that Ukraine would be a member of the Alliance - it was released again and again, the last time - during the Madrid summit in June year. Everyone agreed: it is a matter of Ukraine and allies - to decide when the right time will come to invite Ukraine to full membership. This is not about Moscow. Putin has no veto on expansion, ”the Alliance head emphasized.

He recalled again that NATO's most difficult task is to ensure that President Putin does not win this war so that Ukraine would win.He emphasized the need to maintain the unity of allies in the Ukrainian assistance in the fight against the Russian invasion, and thanked the United States for the leadership in mobilizing such assistance as from NATO allies, such from partner countries around the world.

About it reports [press service](https://minagro.gov.ua/news/znishchennya-rosiyanami-kahovskoyi-ges-zavdalo-znachnih-zbitkiv-silskomu-gospodarstvu-ukrayini)Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.

The report states the following: “The Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, according to preliminary estimates, as a result of terrorist acts at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, provides in Kherson region, flooding about 10 thousand hectares of agricultural land on the Right Bank. Also in several carzes more on the left bank of the region, which is now under the occupation. Detal information will be known in the coming days, after analyzing the information of the tasks about the size of the flood.

In addition, the man -made disaster will stop water supply 31 irrigation systems of Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.

In 2021, these systems provided irrigation by 584 thousand hectares, of which about 4 million tons of grain and oil crops were painted, worth about $ 1.5mlrd.

In 2023, only 13 irrigation systems operate on the right bank of the Dnieper. Terrorist act on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station actually left 94% of irrigation systems in Kherson, 74% in Zaporizhzhia and 30% - in the Dnieper regions. The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station will lead to the fact that the Polyana South of Ukraine can turn into a desert next year. Not only agrarians and water users, but the sources of drinking water supply of settlements, will be affected by the Bezkakhov reservoir.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-07T10-00-00-04-00/20.54.53.jpeg)The negative effects of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station will also be for the fisheries. The death of fish both young and adults is already recorded. The spawning period has ended and as a result of falling water levels, caviar dried names.

In addition, the Fauna water flow of the reservoir into the floodplains formed by the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant will also die. Since in the future, when the "flood" wave is reduced, these bioresurses will be on land.

Another problem will be the ingress and death of freshwater fish and other bioresurses into the salty waters of the Black Sea. The Black Sea fauna of the disgraceful influx of fresh water may also die.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-07T10-00-00-04-00/20.54.52.jpeg)The negative effects of devastation of aquatic bioresources will be traced for several years in a row, even when filling the bed of the Kakhovsky water storage in the near future. Since the renewal of quantitative and qualitative composition of fish populations, the restoration of bottom coenoses of the forage base requires long.

We emphasize that all data are given only by preliminary estimates. The final ones can only be done when the water level stabilizes. ”

NATO manager stated this today during a public discussion(CNAS)Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“In what is concerned with an offensive([Ukraine](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina) )- We see an increase in the intensity of battles along the front line. The alley is always very careful not to talk about operational parts. This is really the right of Ukrainians - to talk about such things. We also saw this video(General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - ed.), which they placed in a social media, and which really calls to refrain from information about the counter -offensive of or prompt details, ”Jens Stoltenberg said, responding to a moderator of the discussion.

He stressed that any war is unpredictable, and no one can say how it will develop. But what is probably known is that Ukrainian respects currently have the capabilities, weapons, ammunition and necessary tension, which were provided, in particular, NATO Allies and partners of the contact group for assistance to Ukraine for US leadership.

“We also know that Ukrainians have already proven: they are able to push Russian forces, as they did it in the north, around Kiev, only in several times, in the east, around Kharkiv, and in the south, in Kherson. Now they have more equipment, more training, they are better prepared for the release of larger territories, ”said NATO Secretary General.

“No one can predict what this war is over. But we know: that it will take place at the table of negotiations, which, we will hope, will put an end to this war on a certain stage - this will depend entirely on the achievement of the target battlefield. Therefore, we must strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield so that they hold such a result of this war that will ensure the preservation of Ukraine as a seven and independent country, and that Putin does not win this war, ”Yinstoltenberg added.

According to Ukrinform, Alexander Sergienko, Director of the Analytical and Research Center "Institute of City" informed [Ukrainian Radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101596&fbclid=IwAR1OyvnEboxR8NhFyXm2dcGUXtXCgkklztXeUFpDhkWo1VVZc4MHZSViLyA).

According to the expert, there will be nothing to the water pipes and gas pipes, although they will probably have to be blown. Instead, electrical contacts, where possible, threaten significant damage.

Pumping stations in the basements can also be damaged.

"Because there are pumps everywhere, electricity works everywhere, and if you do not turn off - it will be a short closure and everything will just be burned. Second - do not forget that it will come down or late because it will spread. Everything will depend on how much water has penetrated into the system Water supply, gas supply, in variations, other mechanisms, " - said the expert.

In his opinion, it is quite realistic to restore the working condition of all units, because water is not an aggressive fluid, although oxidation is likely.

Yes, if the nodes are made qualitatively, when the water comes down, they will need to be a little overwhelmed, cleaned and lubricated. "The faster the water goes down, the easier it will be. It is difficult to predict," Sergienko added.

"We have a rapid fall in water, we are at risk of stopping water utilities, that is, threatening the disappearance of centralized water supply," he said.

Yevtushenko noted that the water supply of the district is provided by three large infrastructure objects. Two of them, while maintaining the current rates of falling, will lose the technical opportunity to continue their work tomorrow. In this case, the district center will suffer the least, as the Nikopol water utilities will preserve the ability to collect water with structural features.

At the same time, the RVA chief stressed that the country's leadership and local authorities have plans to resolve the critical situation and are working on it. The government's large infrastructure solutions will not be able to embody either back or week, so now it is about attracting additional water volumes of Nikopol. In particular, the locals were urged to make incentive water as long as possible and drinking bottled. The administration entails Ukrainian and international funds that will provide bottled water already in the day and day of today, and the communities will distribute it to the middle.

Also, according to him, with Ukrzaliznytsya the issue of delivery of tisses is elaborated.

Yevtushenko stressed that the task is complicated by a large number of people in the area: about 280 thousand people lived in a full -scale invasion in the Nikopol region, to which about 40,000 displaced persons were added. In addition, in the warm season there is an increased risk of intestinal infections. However, the authorities are aware of these challenges and work to overcome them.

The Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor Igor Kuzin said this during communication with journalists on June 7, Ukrinform reports.

"Concerning forecasts. Floods are a significant risk factor for the development of outbreaks that are associated with drinking water. First of all, it is a disease such as virus hepatitis, and, unfortunately, it appears first during such occasions. Second, this is the spread of acute intestinal infections which are related to how food is used or used, whether they can be washed or adequately prepared. And acute intestinal infections are also related to the possibility of access to safe and quality drinking [water(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voda). Therefore, we do not rule out that the situation of acute intestinal infections can also be deteriorated, "Kuzin said.

The third disease, according to the chief state office, is botulism, which can be associated with the use of fish that died as a result of massive wetlands of the destruction of the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Dam.

"We see the mass of the mass of fish as a result of flooding, so for us it is a percentic situation, because such fish can gather the population and be used for cooking, canning, drying. Dangerous because they may be associated with the spread of such infectious disease like botulism, "Kuzin warned.

"These three groups of infectious diseases are the greatest danger. Epidemic supervision has been increased for their preventive, additional measures are being carried out and the public work is being carried out," the chief sanctions said.

“The question is about security guarantees or certificates and future membership(Ukraine in NATO - ed.). Тому що, коли ця війна завершиться, ми маємозабезпечити, щоб це не була якась пауза, протягом якої президент Путін зможевідпочити, переформуватися та розгорнути свої сили для ще однієї атаки, як мице бачили протягом багатьох років. Ця війна почалася не минулого року, вонапочалася набагато раніше – у 2014-му. Коли ця війна завершиться, нам будутьнеобхідні рамкові заходи, щоб історія не повторилася, і щоб президент Путін неміг надалі шахраювати з європейською безпекою», - сказав Столтенберг.

Він зауважив, що головною гарантією безпеки для [ НАТО](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)There is Article 5 of the Washington Treaty Collective Defense and full membership. Discussions are currently underway on the provision of security guarantees for Ukraine, in particular, at the level of bilateral relations with some of the allies.

“Certainly, it is too early to anticipate the results of Vilnius -Samite on this issue in advance, but the Allies have already agreed with many important -speakers concerning Ukraine and its path to membership. NATO doors remain open ... All allies agreed that Ukraine would be a member of the Alliance - it was released again and again, the last time - during the Madrid summit in June year. Everyone agreed: it is a matter of Ukraine and allies - to decide when the right time will come to invite Ukraine to full membership. This is not about Moscow. Putin has no veto on expansion, ”the Alliance head emphasized.

He recalled again that NATO's most difficult task is to ensure that President Putin does not win this war so that Ukraine would win.He emphasized the need to maintain the unity of allies in the Ukrainian assistance in the fight against the Russian invasion, and thanked the United States for the leadership in mobilizing such assistance as from NATO allies, such from partner countries around the world.

_Video: [Presidential Office](https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua)_

** Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!**

Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!

Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.

But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.

Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.

Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.

But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.

Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!We also called for the departure of an international observation mission to Kakhovka, to replace the units and all structures of the station. Unfortunately, world attention was not enough to provide all this. We now need to concentrate the world for the treatment of the consequences of another disaster due to the fault of Russia, we must prevent the more destructive activity of the invaders.

He spent some important international conversations today.

Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.

Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, Ukraine's de -occupation is a tasks.

France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.

Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.

Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.

First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. The sustainability of supply is the main principle.

Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhya, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to have been solved by the occupiers.

Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all are involved to the maximum to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!

And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.

** Glory to all our heroes!**

** Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians!**

**Glory to Ukraine!**

“In what is concerned with an offensive([Ukraine](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina) )- We see an increase in the intensity of battles along the front line. The alley is always very careful not to talk about operational parts. This is really the right of Ukrainians - to talk about such things. We also saw this video(General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - ed.), which they placed in a social media, and which really calls to refrain from information about the counter -offensive of or prompt details, ”Jens Stoltenberg said, responding to a moderator of the discussion.

He stressed that any war is unpredictable, and no one can say how it will develop. But what is probably known is that Ukrainian respects currently have the capabilities, weapons, ammunition and necessary tension, which were provided, in particular, NATO Allies and partners of the contact group for assistance to Ukraine for US leadership.

“We also know that Ukrainians have already proven: they are able to push Russian forces, as they did it in the north, around Kiev, only in several times, in the east, around Kharkiv, and in the south, in Kherson. Now they have more equipment, more training, they are better prepared for the release of larger territories, ”said NATO Secretary General.

“No one can predict what this war is over. But we know: that it will take place at the table of negotiations, which, we will hope, will put an end to this war on a certain stage - this will depend entirely on the achievement of the target battlefield.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in [video closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFaUZEBqiYU), reports Ukrinform.

** Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!**

Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!

Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.

But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.

Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.

Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.

But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.

Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!We also called for the departure of an international observation mission to Kakhovka, to replace the units and all structures of the station. Unfortunately, world attention was not enough to provide all this. We now need to concentrate the world for the treatment of the consequences of another disaster due to the fault of Russia, we must prevent the more destructive activity of the invaders.

He spent some important international conversations today.

Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.

Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, Ukraine's de -occupation is a tasks.

France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.

Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.

Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.

First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. The sustainability of supply is the main principle.

Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhya, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to have been solved by the occupiers.

Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all are involved to the maximum to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!

And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.

** Glory to all our heroes!**

** Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians!**

**Glory to Ukraine!**

About it [reported](https://gur.gov.ua/content/ukraina-hotova-rozghlianuty-zvernennia-pro-evakuatsiiu-z-bielgorodshchyny.html)Representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov.

“The fighting is ongoing. Several settlements occupied the Rashist authorities in fact left without control, trying only to establish fire control, which means the task of strokes from artillery, reactive systems of volley fire to the objects of their own civil infrastructure and local residents, ” - said the representative of the GRO of Ukraine.

According to Andriy Yusov, the RDC fighters and the Legion "Freedom of Russia" actually determine the function of armed self -defense in the territory of Belgrod region, where they protect their own compatriots from the criminal Kremlin regime.

“The support of the rebels among the local population is increasing. This applies to the Yakochya attachment to the armed struggle against Putin, as well as the local residents who ask for protection, ”said a representative of military intelligence, adding that Ukraine will consider the evacuation of civilians in the proper order, if they arrive.

Andriy Yusov noted that the number of insurgents who fight against the Putin regime is increasing, and the geography of their actions is expanding.

“The so -called Russian Federation today is an incapable state, whose sootacities are many conflicts. The central government is inadequate, and the events are absolutely demonstrated by the events. Everything that is a little capable, focused in the Ukrainian territories, and in Russia - disorder, chaos, anarchy and powerlessness. This means that such conflicts can be widening and gaining scale in different corners of the country, which is called the Russian Federation, including in the capital region, ” - summed up Andrei Yusov.

«Служба безпеки задокументувала злочинну діяльність ще 7 чиновників-колаборантів, які переховуються на тимчасово окупованій території України.Однією з них є очільниця створеної агресором „адміністрації Чорноморськогорайону Криму“ Наталія Пісарєва. Її кандидатуру на це „крісло“ нещодавноособисто погодив місцевий гауляйтер Аксьонов. До цього призначення Пісарєвабула так званою „першою заступницею міністра культури“ на тимчасовозахопленому півострові», — йдеться у повідомленні.

Зазначається, що перебуваючи на цій «посаді», після початку повномасштабноговторгнення вона координувала ворожу інформкампанію щодо підтримки збройноїагресії рф. Тоді фігурантка публічно закликала українських захисниківздаватися в полон, а також агітувала мешканців Криму вступати до російськихвійськ для війни проти України. За це окупаційний «військовий комісаріатКриму» нагородив її грамотою.

За даними слідства, до захоплення українського півострова Пісарєва керуваларегіональним проєктним офісом апарату Ради міністрів автономної республіки.Однак, під час його захоплення підтримала агресора і згодом увійшла до такзваного кадрового резерву окупаційної адміністрації.

Ще однією колаборанткою є колишня посадовиця Управління Державноїказначейської служби України в Луганській області. Після захоплення частинирегіону вона добровільно погодилась на «пропозицію» агресора очолити так зване«казначейство лнр».

До «штату» псевдоустанови вона залучила ще п’ятьох спільників. Ними виявилисьїї колишні підлеглі зі Старобільського, Новоайдарського, Міловського,Новопсковського та Марківського районів. У складі окупаційного органу вонистали керівниками відповідних районних «управлінь казначейської служби лнр».На цих «посадах» вони брали участь у фінансовому забезпеченні російськихокупаційних угруповань, які були задіяні на східному фронті.

Commenting at the request of the leading development of events in the Belgorod region, Anna Malyar, in particular, noted that the defense department closely monitors the state of affairs of the Nabolgorod direction.

- The responsibility for the liberation of Russia from the ruling regime was taken over by Russian citizens who do not want to put up with the current policy of their power. Such a chain reaction will be widening by all regions of the aggressor country, because Russian society is not so unambiguous to the war, which was resolved by Russia in Ukraine, as we have served. This does not mean that they are Ukraine's benefits, first of all, they realize that Russia is destroying this war with this war, - said Anna Malyar.

About it [reports](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zatrymala-rosiiskoho-ahenta-yakyi-shpyhuvav-za-boiovoiu-aviatsiieiu-zsu-na-dnipropetrovshchyni)Security Service of Ukraine.

He also handed over to the invaders of the location of the territorial centers of staffing and social support(military enlistment offices)and tried to identify rail lines involved in the supply of ammunition to the front. For each task, the Russian agent received from his "curator" from the FSB to 4 thousand hryvnias. For conspiracy the money was transferred by the traitor with the help of a cryptocurrency electronic wallet.

Intelligence information was needed to prepare the series of air strikes in the region, first of all for the defeat of strategic objects.

According to the investigation, a local resident was detained, who was a staffing officer of the FSB in July 2022. In the field of view of the Russian special service, he got through one of the Russian telegrams, where he periodically launched a photo of the positions of Ukrainian troops.

In the future, he maintained connection with the aggressor through the messenger. To perform the intelligence he went to the area where he was hidden watching the objects, and also asked the information he needed from people.

When searches at the place of residence of the person, the mobile phone of Iplanchet was found, which he used to communicate with the FSB.

The detainee was informed of a suspicion of a state betrayal committed in the conditions of a state.

- I have been studying Russia for a long time. Long before the upgrade, I worked on the topic of today's roundstone. I analyzed Russia with the eyes and evaluations of its citizens, political scientists of Taexers. On the basis of this analysis, he came to the simple conclusion that Russia is approaching the fascist state, - said Vladimir Ogrizko.

The head of the Center for the Research of Russia also shared his own observations of Tadumas regarding the further economic development of the aggressor state.

- I study Russia, and I see that every year it is becoming more and more toxic. Watching its foreign policy and separatist trends, it was concluded that it will not be economically unseen for more than one and a half decade. Now Russia has come to the finish line of its present development and, of course, because of many circumstances, it will fall apart on pieces, - emphasized the lord's lodimir.

Former Foreign Minister of Ukraine also emphasized the importance of making Western partners of the idea that the liberal opposition in the Russian Federation is "a cemile bubble, what is not really."

** Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!**

Today, the maximum attention of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Dozens of settlements are flooded in the territory controlled by us. Those houses!

Evacuation continues. And under shelling!Russian artillery continues to beat, no matter what. Just inhumans.

But as of this time, more than 2 thousand people have been improved in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone who is involved in this work, everyone who helps!Our task is to protect life and to help people.

Absolutely catastrophic situation in the occupied part of Kherson region. Occupiantly threw people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just the supplies of houses in flooded communities. And this is another conscious crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a catastrophe, it also maximized the harm from it.

Now a clear and quick reaction of the world is needed to what is happening. Even it is possible to establish for sure how many people on the temporarily occupying territory of Kherson region can die without salvation, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and intelligence services are as high as they save people despite the fire.

But larger efforts are needed. International organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of the Kherson region. Every kind of person there is a sentence of existing international architecture, international organizations that have learned to save life. If there is no international organization now in the area of this disaster, then it is not at all, then it is incapacitated. There are all relevant appeals of Ukraine, our government.

Many leaders of the world, leaders of states, governments, interstate associations have expressed their support to Ukraine and a clear condemnation of Russian crime. I thank this principle!

Together, we must also hold the occupiers. They have more than a year controlled both the dam and the whole hydroelectric power station. Russian propagandists seriously and openly developing such a scenario of the man -made catastrophe they have reported. Last autumn, we warned the world about the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.He spent some important international conversations today.

Turkish President Erdogan. He informed him about the situation in flooded areas, about our rescue operations and urgent needs to help people.

Of course, they also discussed the risks for the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is under the control of the occupiers. There is an agreement with the IAEA leader to proactivize the work of IAEA representatives at the station. But it is clear that, there are no full security, the governors there. Therefore, the de -occupation of Ukraine is a tasks.

France President Macron. They discussed - and in great detail - all the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the station, in general the situation. Everything we can do to people affected by the regions.

Defense actions were also thoroughly discussed, as well as international measures that are preparing for everything, because we need safety despite any aggressive and frank-free actions of Russia.

Separately, I want to point out a few things that are important to our country, which is particularly for people in our regions that depended on the Kakhovsky Direction.

First. We will provide drinking water with drinking water. In all areas, areas, cities of Isella, where it is necessary. Where the drinking water is now, all necessary supply systems will be made. Supply is the main principle.

Second. The world will be with us. The partners are fully informed of what is giving away, what help we need. Whatever there are economic, social, environmental consequences of this catastrophe, all the foundations of life will be preserved. Kherson region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Dniprovskaya - we see all the problems and make it possible and impossible to solve the problems.

Third. The direct duty of representatives of the state and local authorities in all communities and areas that have suffered are assistance to people. From the Government and the SESA of the complementary authorities, local communities - all to the maximum are involved to rescue and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should perceive this task. And I thank those who perceive it in this way!We take care of each other and Ukraine!

And, of course, today I thank each of our warrior, all units, all the masters who continue to beat the occupiers.

Bakhmut direction, Avdiivka, all "Khortytsia", all "Tavriya" - you are good!

Let that, every day should be the day of destruction of the enemy.

Glory to all our heroes!

Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians!

**Glory to Ukraine!**

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-08T-4-27-00-03-00/630_360_1685616882-658.jpg)Ukraine is not involved in the blast of the Nord Stream gas pipelines to the Ubalti Sea in September last year.

According to Ukrinform, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated in an interview with German community [bild](http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/ukraine-praesident-selenskyj-das-bedeutet-der-dammbruch-fuer-die-gegenoffensive-84247066.bild.html).

"First of all, I would like you to understand: I am the President, and I give orders to Chicamanda. Ukraine did not do anything like this. I would not go for it," said.

When asked if he knows something about this, Zelensky called: "We know nothing. 100%."

He added that Ukraine advocates an independent investigation into the incident.

As it was reported, at the end of September 2022, as a result of the explosions of the Northern Stream and Nord Stream-2 sowing pipelines near the Bornholm Island, the Baltic Sea was leaked in four sections [gas pipelines](http://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-gazoprovid)in the exclusive economic zones of Dannya Sweden.

In many countries, they tend to believe that the northern flow has been initiated by Russia. In the Russian Federation, involvement in the accident is interpreted.

In March, some foreign media reported reports of the alleged involvement of "pro -Ukrainian groups" in the incident.
