<p>Olena Pavlenko, President of the Dixigrour Analytical Center, informed in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“Reduction of Russian gas exports is a consequence of Russia's behavior that has maintained a response in the European Union.

<p>“That is, they do not have the money to do further with the exploration and drill a new release. And if it is, it is not as scale as it was before, ”the expert emphasized.</p>

These players are the half -team team of the team, which, in addition, have several experienced players. Collection does not require unnecessary representation.

<p>He told about it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“The Olympic Games are the largest competitions that have a great luck. It was very brave to get there. We train every day, teach, and do it to take part in them. Now all our attention is drawn to the European GIRL, because it is our main start. After them, it will be known who will go to the Olympic games and who - not. I am confident in myself 100 percent, and there will already be a look at how everything will happen. It is most unfortunate that we will now go Naypal Games, we will win the Olympic licenses there, and in the end we can go to the Olympics because the Russians will be allowed there. It will be a good situation - to get a license and not go to the Olympics, because representatives of Russia and Belarus will be tamped, ”Kartzan explained.</p>
<p>The boxer of the national team of Ukraine also stressed that the newly created Worldboxing should displace the International Boxing Association.</p>
<p>“I really want the new World Boxing organization to gain momentum and be able(International Boxing Association). ІВА – дуже корумпованаорганізація, яку очолює росіянин Кремльов. Ми розуміємо, що через нього,наприклад, нам можуть не віддавати перемогу в деяких поєдинках. Сподіваюсь, щозовсім скоро всі будуть в рівних умовах змагатись у новій організації», -підсумував Карцан.</p>

<p>This was announced during the roundtable "Employment of People with Disabilities: European Perspectives in Ukraine" at the Media Center "Ukraine - Ukrinform" by Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine Tatiana Berezhna.</p>
<p>“The existing employers' promotion program that involves compensation for a person with a disability of 50% of labor costs, but not more than UAH 6,700, is hardly used by employers. Because it is consumed for persons who are officially registered with employment centers. And there are very few such people among all the unemployed: in that year, their share was only 5.7%. Therefore, the Ministry of Economy has prepared a project that proposes to disseminate a range of programs for employers for integration into the labor market not just officials from among persons with <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-invalidnist"></a>”, - said the Deputy Minister.</p>
<p>In particular, the procedure for compensation for the arrangement of a workplace for persons with the first and second group of disability is developed.</p>
<p>“These will be rather high in size. Thus, for the arranged working place of people with disabilities of the first group it is proposed to return up to 15 size mining wages, which is just over 100 thousand UAH. As for the second group, it is about the amount of compensation in 10 minimum wages, ”Berezhna stressed.</p>

"To Ukraine, even the previous victims of Russian aggression did not violate the cure so acutely," he said.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Radbez is "helpless and ineffective", when it comes to the aggression of Ukraine, and on the other - on his agenda is nearly fifty inquiries, he explained the post. "That is, only the Ukrainian issue, which is one of the most systematic ones, today cannot be at least somehow resolved in the UN Council," he said.</p>
<p>However, in his opinion, on other issues, the Radbez can act quite effectively. “Discussions are being discussed, decisions are made from vital problems for some countries and groups of countries. It is, in particular, at least twelve -fashionable peacekeeping operations, fourteen sanctions, which were implemented by the Security Council, including the non -proliferation of weapons. They are considered regularly, and decisions are made, ”Kyslytsy said.</p>

They do not correspond to its interests, such as the sanction regime against Iran. "What Iiran and Russia, by the way, are actively violating," he added.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the stay of Russia in the RB would be inappropriate from the point of view of practical countries, says postpress.</p>
<p>As for the right of veto, to which the Russian Federation resorts, deprivation of it and the adoption of the RB about the immediate termination of the war would not mean that Putin would perform it.“For more than two decades, the world has allowed and forgot Putin. It was an outburst of his plans to create an autocracy, which is completely pushed into any decisions of regional and global organizations, ”-said Oxyl.</p>
<p>As it was reported, in April, Russia is presiding on the UN Security Council. The presidency of this body changes every month between its members. In May, this role will be done by Switzerland, in June - the UAE.</p>
<p>The Radbeza includes five permanent members of the United Nations - USA, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia(on the site of the Soviet Union), vetoed by 10 member states on a rotary basis.</p>

<p>“Our support is thorough and long -term: in order to protect Ukraine with its people, to restore the sources of existence and implementation of social proceeds, in anti -corruption reforms and decentralization as part of the process of Ukraine's connection to the EU.

<p>“Although Ukrainians can sometimes assume that we are lagging behind in providing military support, I want to summarize two important things in view of the above. First, Germany with Ukraine.

<p>This was reported in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zahidnuy.kordon/posts/pfbid0Syb3HfLLZBJbNzDjSb3CGcFH5gZz7NZs6wSVMZ5KF58L5n1pDCDvmE1Js9DEc5KGl"></a>Western Regional Directorate of the State Tax Service of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"This morning on social networks there was information about illegalization in the border in the territory of Uzhany National Park, which seemed to have led to the death of a wild animal( <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vedmid"></a> )and possible involvement in this employees of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Given the wide -voice, which this publication has acquired, the leadership of the Chop Border Guard took immediate measures to check the information set out on social networks, its accuracy, as well as all the circumstances of the event. It should be noted that the information is not true, " - the message reads.</p>
<p>As it is currently established, in the beginning of April this year, a border guard found a corpse of a maleweddy on the area of the border unit "Kamianitsa" of the Chop detachment, not a bear, which is confirmed by the relevant act.</p>
<p>According to the SSSU, the head of the border unit informed about the detection of the beast body of the border unit. The last arrival of the place of detection of a dead animal and in the presence of border guards convinced the natural death of the bear. After that, the foresters buried the corpse of the animal, which is confirmed by the relevant act, which also specifies the transmission of signs of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>Separately, the DPSU noted that the distance from the place where the bear's body was found is about 60 kilometers from the area where the servicemen of the Stuzhitsa department were previously found a bear, which was discussed in a post of representative of the Uzhuzhan National Park.</p>
<p>For full objectivity and establishment of all circumstances, the management of the Chop Border Detachment conducts an official investigation. The National Police and Kamyanitsky Forestry, and Border Guards, were also at the scene.</p>
<p>In view of the situation, the SPSU is not asked to rush with the conclusions and unburdened unverified information before the completion of the audience.</p>
<p>The results of the investigation at the SSSU are promised to report additionally.As it was reported, earlier the head of the State Protection Department of the Uzhansky Park Vladislav Kamenz published a post on Facebook and photos of men of border guards near the Dead Bear.</p>
<p>According to the Uzhan National Park, according to their information, they should believe that the bear was destroyed as a result of illegally designed and carried out and carried out by officials of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine.</p>
<p>On April 16, a bear was found in the territory of the former Veliko Berezny district, which was assaled to Domashin village. It was handed over to the employees of the Uzhansky National Park, and those, in turn, transferred it for rehabilitation to the center of rehabilitation of the bear "Synevyr". After rehabilitation, the bear is promised to be reinforced into the wild.</p>

<p>On this during the roundtable "Employment of people with disabilities: European prospects in Ukraine" at the Media Center "Ukraine - Ukrinform" emphasized the Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine Oksana Zholnovich.</p>
<p>“The level of desire to work among people with disabilities is actually higher than the prose is spoken by employers. This is one of the stereotypes, as if people with disabilities want to work. Obviously, we are simply lacking the tools to combine these categories in the labor market, ”the minister said.</p>

<p>“Now we have a dramatically changing portrait of a person with disabilities. This is a young man or girl who was active for war. They are not ready to close the hardware after receiving a disability. And the main task of the ministries of politics, the government as a whole, the parliament - to change the approaches and rules of interaction with such people, which will be built not on a paternalistic basis, not in the forms of payment of benefits, but in the format of creation of worthy conditions for qualitatively consuming people with disabilities.</p>
<p>She added that government officials are focused on solving a complex task of integration into social and working life of people with disabilities, which will be made of providing timely and qualitative rehabilitation, ensuring the possibility of acquiring new or additional skills instead of lost and providing noise services to support and support.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, this is in an interview with the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0mSL4CiTCg"></a>The head of the NBU Andriypyshny told.</p>
<p>“Prices will be reduced. Demand for currency is decreasing. This is the result, including monetary policy <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nacbank"></a>, which many people did not like and now do not like it. It is the result that Ukrainian energy, thanks to the effective work of the government and the courage of Ukrainian energy, quickly resumed its capacity.

If it is sore, painful and unclear where to start talking to a stranger. But it is so much that someone is listening right now. Please - talk to those who listen to profession. Who understands how to support so in order not to harm. Who helps to dispose of thoughts and give advice on what to do in a crisis situation(and not only). Бо навіть якщо ви в безпеці і прямо зараз нічого поганого не сталося,але вам важко, — ви маєте право на підтримку», - наголосила перша леді.</p>

<p>Colonel Yuriy Ignat reported this on the air marathon "Unified News" today on the television marathon "Unified News". We will remind, Silippo destroyed 15 out of 18 winged missiles issued by the occupiers last night.</p>
<p>He noted that at about 02:30 the Russian invaders attacked Ukraine strategic aviation-nine Tu-95 from the area of Olenagogorsk(Murmansk region)and two Tu-160 from the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>-In total, 18 winged air base missiles X-101/X-555 were released. Forces and air defense means of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 15. Unfortunately, not all missiles were destroyed. But for one hundred percent result, it is necessary to strengthen our air defense and fighter cover, including F-16 aircraft.</p>
<p>The officer noted that Tu-95 can produce much more winged missiles-8 incorporate more if additional loads are available. An uninhabited attack this night is a sign that Russia has reduced rockets production.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the invaders could afford more rockets, they would be hit by a large amount. Because so many aircraft can be raised, and Tu-160 can be more than Tu-95 more than Tu-95, we potentially understand what Zazalp could be.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, the enemy strategic aviation is in this way.</p>

<p>He noted that in Bakhmut there is a positional war, when from time to time the enemy, hitting the great artillery forces, destroys infrastructure and has some success. At the same time, Ukrainian defenders are counterattack and often conquer the back position.</p>
<p>-Despite the involvement of powerful forces, the enemy is not able to capture Bakhmut's state-fortress completely,-he said. - In this direction, the enemy uses many nomenclatures of various weapons, all of them have arsenal. At the same time, we blink to different variants of events and try to take into account all the lesions that the enemy can cause.</p>
<p>Sergiy Cherevaty noted that the terrorist organization of the Wagner PEC remains the main shock force that storms Ukrainian positions in Bakhmut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the enemy attracts, for example, snipers from special contrast services to maximize our positions. That is, there are opportunities for the assembly to cause us maximum harm and seize a city.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, thanks to the powerful echelorated defense of Ukrainians, the occupiers cannot take the city for 9 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>We carry out a successful defense operation and achieve the main goal - we make a maximum destruction of the military potential of the enemy. The Criminal Organization of the Wagner -Oblizka to what will be broken, which was recently stated by its head Pryhozhin, - said the spokesman of the Eastern group of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces. - Our military will be trained, operate rationally and powerfully. We integrated the Soviet nomenclature of rocket and artillery weapons together with the Western, which was held. It is a unique experience that no country in the world has probably have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sergey Cherevaty also noted that the enemy had decreased opportunities, but unfortunately, not as we would like.</p>
<ul>
<li>In areas where the enemy concentrates his attention as much as possible, he can use a lot of ammunition. However, such a luxury, when the invaders of the front line of the front used an infinite number of ammunition and worked Non-stop mode, as it was last year, they have already lost.</li>

So he commented on the information about receiving Ukraine's second IRIS-T missile system. Recall that the first IRIS-t Ukraine received the last fall. Two more installations are planned this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of air forces, we have almost all the nomenclature of arms from our Western partners. Only SAMP/T and F-16 are left. The universal we receive is already working in Ukraine. It is about ZRK. But they are not. Of course, the news is very good for us that Iris-T of Chipatriot is in Ukraine. But these complexes need much more. Ukraine is one of the most familiar countries in Europe, the air defense system is very extensive, so not all directions will be blocked. Three settings up to 40 km by radius(It is the maximum-hat of the lesion of one iris-t)They will be able to protect the front line of approximately B100 km.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of this, a spokesman for the Air Force once again emphasized that Ukraine needed a metening, which could ensure fully protection of the airspace of the bundling cover from the air.</p>
<p>He also added that all the foreign CRCs obtained can work in a single information field.</p>
<p>-Iris-T is one of the most modern complexes today, it has a powerful radar that sees very detailed and clearly and can distinguish between the smallest goals with a delicious effective reflective surface. Iris-T can work in a single information field with Western systems, such as Nasams, Patriot and Samp/T. Chocomplexes can exchange prompt information, it is very important today. Let's say that if one complex has not destroyed the target, it will be insured by another.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to Yuri Ignat, Iris-T is a new complex, and Germany may not quickly make them enough. But work with German partners will work for a long time. It is possible to apollect the available Air Defense forces of Ukraine at the expense of other systems, such as NNASAMS, which are many in the world.</p>

<h1>The statements of the chief "Wagner" can be hostile IPSO - military expert Petro Chernik</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-01T66-00-00-04-00/2023-05-01_125854.jpg" />Today, on the air marathon "The One News", the military experture of Chernik commented on the situation in the Bakhmut direction.</p>
<p>He identified two main reasons why the Russian army, despite huge losses, has been trying to seize this city for 9 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, there are two reasons for why Bakhmut is epicenteric action for a long time and why Russians will not try to find a different position. This is political and psychological. First of all, Putin gave a single order to Zabakhmut and enter the administrative border of Donetsk region. And Bakhmut are keys in this direction, strategic altitude. The psychological moment is the question of the principle for Russians - they put so many people there that they can no longer stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, Bakhmut performs a strategic expression on the gripping of the enemy's technique for Ukrainian defenders.</p>
<p>Regarding the statements of the head of the criminal organization of PEC "Wagner" Prigogine on Bracursuris, Petro Chernyk noted that it could be an information and psychological operation of the enemy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The statements of the chief "Wagner" can be a hostile IPSO aimed at ensuring that we fall into the trap of the enemy's expected weakness, such an information noise. In my opinion, in Russia there is now a crazy job about finding the guilty of strategic defeat in Ukraine. That is, the struggle between the Kremlin towers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The military expert added that chaotization in the Russian Federation is a good process, because where there is a Euronal struggle, there are necessarily mistakes that can contribute to the struggle of Ukraine with the general Moscow imperialism.</p>
<p>Chernik also noted that the total number of hostile attacks, how to compare it, was significantly reduced: from 100-120 a day to 40.</p>
<ul>
<li>And this is good news. At the same time, the enemy is studying, it cannot be evaluated. It should be remembered that war is a path of deception.</li>

<p>The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov told about it in an interview with Tandriy Tsaplienko on the air of the Teleterna "Unified News".</p>
<p>He noted that there are three lines of service and repair. First of all, it is a minor repair.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crews and techniques of Ukrainian units are trained and know how to do it. The task is to provide them with spare parts. We are already producing some spare parts for Western equipment in the Ukrainian market - both in state and most enterprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second repair line is a more complex, medium level of complexity, which can be fulfilled at Ukrainian enterprises located at a certain distance of the front of the front, in those cities where there are industrial capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our engineers and techniques have learned to make such repairs. But here also requires copies, drawings, engineering documents, so we constantly conduct negotiations about permits, licenses and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>If necessary, in a difficult repair that concerns electronics or something, the equipment is forced to send abroad. To carry out it built a hub in partner countries.</p>
<p>-For example, about Leopard 2 tanks, we have signed a memorandum on the previous Ramstinna together with Germany's Defense Minister and Viceremier-Minister of the Polish National Defense Minister of Poland on the creation of a hab of repair in Poland. VPK will set up to deploy its production capacity there. Every day we work over the main task - a constant, unobstructed, uninterrupted restoration of technology, - said Alexei Reznikov.</p>

<p><em>!It is on this it is to work ”, </em><em> </em><em> - </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Havrylov during the official launch of a single coordination platform of Defense Tech Brave1. </em><em> </em>* Defense Tech Brave1.</p>
<p>*!</p>
<p><strong> In an exclusive comment on the correspondent Armyinform, the official said that communication remains one of our main problems: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ukrainians who have unique ideas that could significantly strengthen the domestic defense sector are not always well informed. In combination with state bureaucracy, this leads to the use of our resources at a minimum. Therefore, the Brave1 platform can be the basis for establishing communication in our country between all participants of innovations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an ecosystem. This is necessary in order for each participant to be free to solve any of his questions and decisions, to know how to help his neighbor or where to go to make his idea more powerful. In my opinion, it is in such an environment that interaction and communication can create a multiplicative effect - to increase the effectiveness of our society at times.</p>

They will be useful to have a relevant relevant technique that eliminates subjectivism. Each project, practical idea will be evaluated and assessed and assisted in their realization.</p>
<ul>
<li>These should be specialists in directions. And why so many of them? Because there are many and work directions. From each of them, from artillery and UAV. Therefore, a qualified expertise must be based on each decision. Non -urban or officials who occupy certain positions and those who are in technology. This is the category that was selected. The General Stock of the Armed Forces is responsible for conducting primary examination, and we assist the quads - specialists from the subordinate Ministry of Defense of Organizations. Tsedulying institutes, we also have a section of the National Academy of Sciences. We are working with universities on military topics. We have a large representation in this expert group, - says Vladimir Gavrilov.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, the leading task at the previous stage of formation of such a group of defense technologies is to find qualified experts who have quickly evaluated, to what category to attribute the idea that comes. For example, if there is a high appraisal category, if there is already a prototype of the product, then it is possible to run into a short category of admission to operation. Or, on the contrary, low, where, in addition to the idea, there is nothing more, and you need to help personally through grants to bring the project to the prototype. And there is already a whole mechanism Brave1 - with their grants, additional examinations and the industrial sites of the Ministry of Social Policy and the Ministry of Economy. And when the prototypes for the Ministry of Defense will be answered, these projects will be all -folding the examination. And then there will be only an accelerator of the Ministry of Defense, which will quickly be armed. This accelerator will be planned to be introduced this week. And it is part of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Minister of Defense Volodymyr Gavrilov, one of the main calls and tasks of the Brave1 platform is the protection of copyright inventors.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a large -scale invasion, the overwhelming number of capitals were recalled that Kiev falls in 3 days and Ukraine in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>-We were prepared for guerrilla wars with the movement of the country's leadership. The partners did not believe that Ukraine was capable not only to resist, but to resist. This happened because of the false assumption that the war will be stripped of the Intercessor and the Great Soviet Army. But it's not. Ukraine has long been a non -Soviet country. In 8 years, the Armed Forces have changed a lot, new officers have grown up to fight the Russians.</p>
<p>Alexei Reznikov noted that the Ukrainians with his victories - the liberation of Mikiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson region, etc., inspired the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each such operation gave an understanding that we need to not just help you, but help us to resist so that we do not lose more. And when the world was aware that the Russian army was rapists and looters, he shuddered. Thus, evolution took place in the heads of the leaders of the countries, and they will already consciously believe in our victory.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the more success we have, the more our allies want to become our partners in this victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of those countries that support us already feel and understand that we are victory are going to the borders of 1991. They support Ukraine's negotiations under its terms and at a time when it is ready.</p>

<p>He said that it has been evolution several times when it is impossible, it was possible from partner countries to ended with real projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know for sure that what is impossible today, maybe tomorrow. This concerned the artillery systems of 155 mm caliber, and Himars, Iris-T, Patriot, and other systems that protect Ukraine today. Therefore, the planes will also be-modern, 4th generation ++.</li>
</ul>
<p>The delay of our partners, according to Alexei Reznikov, is due to the fact that they consciously and responsibly want to reach the victory of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>If partners decide to give us battle aircraft, it is necessary to prepare and training pilots. Then you need to support them in Zauvostan, as well as provide proper weapons. This is the most expensive story. One-leaf F-16 costs about $ 120 million. Next, it must be serviced. 10 -year -olds are $ 1 billion 200 million. Our partners should be weighed to all -processing - according to their taxpayers, and not to reduce the level of assistance they already provide. But modern planes in Ukraine will be, - said Alexei Reznikov.</li>

<h1>In Ukraine, the industry of prostheses needs serious reform - Mikhail Tsymbalyuk</h1>

According to current law, all prosthetics in Ukraine are free of charge. And this is very important to those citizens who doubt today whether a prosthesis is worth establishing. Here the answer should be unambiguous - worth it.</p>
<p>—The ballow of prostheses requires serious reform, because it has been released to the background, several important conditions of Ukraine were closed: Kyiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Cherkasy. The current state has planned more budgetary funds for 2023, because several citizens of Ukraine, especially servicemen, are expected to be prosthetized - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_CXb-tXcY">noted</a>The first deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Social Policy and the Protection of Veterans Rights Mykhailo Tsymbalyuk.</p>
<p><strong> This year in the state budget for prosthetics there are more than UAH 356 million(Last year </strong> <strong> - less than UAH 24 million). Загалом у 2023 на реабілітаціювійськових заплановано понад 2,5 млрд грн. Окрім протезів, кошти підуть напротезно-ортопедичні вироби, спеціальні засоби для самообслуговування тазасоби для пересування.</strong></p>
<p>Михайло Цимбалюк наголосив на необхідності розвитку саме вітчизняної галузіпротезування, зокрема, що нам потрібні добре підготовлені лікарі та бригадиреабілітологів, здатні місяцями працювати над відновленням людини післявстановлення протеза.</p>
<p>— Коли ми звертаємося по допомогу до міжнародних партнерів, громадяни Українимають кілька місяців перебувати за кордоном з метою протезування. Ба більше, умайбутньому протези потребують обслуговування, а якщо протез встановлений закордоном, то громадянину доведеться виїжджати туди, витрачати кошти і час, —пояснив він.</p>
<p>Однозначно більш доцільно встановлювати протез, освоювати його та проходитиреабілітаційний курс у вітчизняних центрах протезування, вважає МихайлоЦимбалюк. В Україні працюють як державні, так і приватні реабілітаційніцентри, тож можна проаналізувати пропозиції і обрати — послуги з протезуваннябезкоштовні.</p>
<p>One of the problems of prosthetics is bureaucratized in communication between those who need prosthetics and government agencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, there is a problem, because when a person loses his limb, it is antening psychologically, so it is important that the local governments, the regulatory structures of the Ministry of Social Policy are not waiting for the citizen or citizen to talk to them, and they did the corresponding work themselves, - said Mykolacibalyuk. - It is important that people know where to go and not waste time, because the recovery period, from the beginning of the prosthesis and dosing, lasts from three to six months. It is a difficult process, and the more it begins, the more complex the future rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will remind, a serviceman who has a certificate of injury(Even if it is not yet issued a disability), is entitled to free receipt of the prosthesis regardless of the number of amputations.</p>
<p>The state prosthetics procedure is currently quite complicated, it provides for series. According to her now, the action algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p>First, the injured person must choose a prosthetic enterprise on his own, and it is difficult to use if you have never encountered it: not just evaluate the technical possible, providing appropriate personnel and honesty of the enterprise, giving prosthetics services.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the choice of the contractor, a contract with a prosthetic enterprise is signed, and it, for its part, concludes an agreement on the Ministry of Social Policy.</p>
<p>Among the existing problems, the most common is prosthetics delay. Usually, it may be due to the fact that businesses do not start work until the budget is received. On the other hand, if the enterprise does not have sufficient production capabilities, then the term of production of the prosthesis can also be delayed. Therefore, you should not delay and seek the prosthetics as soon as possible.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-01T82-00-00-04-00/krym.jpg" />Against the background of the expectations of the Ukrainian counter -offensive former US Army Commander General Ben Gorsi during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XePGi4ipDhU"><strong> expert interview with Spiritofamerica ", </strong></a>said the pronerability of isolation and the de -occupation of Crimea.</p>
<p>“I believe that Crimea is crucial for this war. As long as the Crimean peninsula is stopped, Ukraine will not be protected and safe. If you look at the map, the Crimea with Russian troops is reminiscent of a dagger directed to the abdomen of Ukraine, ”Ben Gogeges said.</p>
<p>The General recalled that Russia uses Crimea as a logistics hub to feed the occupation group on the mainland of Ukraine and a use of the Navy to launch the winged missiles from the Black Sea of Po -Ukrainian cities.</p>
<p>Ben Gogess once again called on the US and Western partners to increase the volume of arms of military equipment for Ukraine, including weapons of a distant radius of action.</p>
<p>The Crimean factor in the Russian-Ukrainian war correspondent Armyinform was united with a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Chernyak.</p>
<p>-Russia began the war against Ukraine with the occupation of Crimea in 2014, transforming sections into a powerful military base. The liberation of Crimea is Russian-Ukrainian and end,-Chernyak emphasized.</p>
<p>The GI representative agreed with Ben Gorsie's estimates, noting his significant halves in the support of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, the enemy should be cut from the Crimea - to make Russia use the temporarily occupied peninsula for military purposes and, ultimately, made the so -called Crimean gesture of goodwill. Achieving this goal can be the key to a just peace <em>, —</em> Andrey Chernyak said.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, Ukraine does not stop taking appropriate measures and the Crimean direction, as evidenced by recent events on the territory of the Void:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kilometer congestion on the illegally consolidated bridge from Kerch to Russia is a joint reaction. The GUR of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine persistently recommends to leave the occupied Kryme, until this option is still available. Ukraine will return and return to the Crimea, _ --_ - summed up Andriy Chernyak.</li>

<li>I am the President of the Congress of Ukrainians in Canada, who represents the interests of 1.5 mln Ukrainian Canadians to the Government of Canada. And I assure you that we are calling the Canadian government daily and lobbying the Ukrainian issue ... It is fortunate that Ukrainian Christ Friland was holding the post of Prime Minister Taministra of Canada's finances.

<p>-According to Prime Minister Denis Shmigal, when he recently visited Canada that the funds for the rebuilding of Ukraine when the war would end, they should not be paid for by taxpayers either Canada or any other state. These are enormous costs, and the amounts will grow when the territories will be de -mentioned. Therefore, Winteresakh G7, EU and other countries to approve similar legislation for aggressors, military criminals paid for the rebuilding of Ukraine, - said Alexander Khichi.</p>
<p>Reference: April 29, 2022, Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, approved the new budget. This law adopted amendments to the three Canadian laws on sanctions. These amendments have introduced mechanisms for the arrest of Russian assets. It is a law on special economic measures and justice for corrupt foreign officials, the so -called Odagnitsky. In 2023, Canada introduced additional changes to strengthen the regime. These amendments will more clearly determine the value of ownership and include the subsidiaries and affiliated companies of those businesses that will be imposed on. Therefore, Canada will be able to more clearly and effectively arrest the assets of subsidiaries and affiliate companies of those businesses that have been imposed on sanctions.</p>

<p>About it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMlmW64xFjg">ether</a>The Unified News Marathon was informed by the Head of the Unified Coordination Press Center of Defense forces of the South of the 1st rank Natalia Humeniuk.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be said that the invaders increased their presence in the Black Sea - they were maneuvering there, almost without going into those bays, which once called the "native harbor". Nowadays, the ship grouping is significantly gravitated by Donovoross, enemy ships are more likely to come, including for replenishment, just there than in the bays of Sevastopol.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ship group, according to Humeniuk, now consists of 10 units of immenya is as dispersed as possible in the area, which the occupiers consider themselves to be a security in the Black Sea closer to the southeastern coast, and try to be as far away from the shore, which is controlled by Ukraine.</p>
<ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-01T92-00-00-04-00/evakuacziya.jpg" />The Ministry of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine has reinforced to the Russian side and the International Committee of the Red Cross by the use of humanitarian corridors to open for those who want to leave the temporarily -corresponding territories.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/vereshchuk_iryna/1900">reported</a>Viceremier-Minister-Minister of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Irivresheschuk.</p>
<p>“Last week, the Russians adopted their next decree aimed at further restricting the rights of Ukrainians in temporarily occupied territories. They want Ukrainians to either become Russians or leave the temporarily occupied territories, ”Irina Vereshchuk said.</p>
<p>She added that forced certification of Ukrainians by Russia or repression would not help.</p>
<p>“First, it is impossible to turn Ukrainians into Russians. Secondly, who said that the Russians will live in temporarily occupied territories for a long time? But if they are concerned with the fact of Ukrainians who do not want to take Russian passports, tons problems. Because the Russians themselves do not release Ukrainians from the control of the control, in violation of international law, and contrary to elementary humanitarian reasoning, ”the Viceremier-Minister said.</p>
<p>It is because of this, emphasizes Irina Vereshchuk, today the Ministry of Reintegration has completely turned to the Russian side and the International Committee of the Red Cross by the use of humanitarian corridors to open. In order for the Ukrainians to be able to go to the government under the control of the territory.</p>
<p>“My recommendations to the Ukrainians on that remain the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russian passports do not take; * Do not cooperate with the occupiers; * to leave if possible; * wait for the Armed Forces, ”Irina Vereshchuk advised.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Monday and New Week began with an hourly meeting with all levels of government and protection. Government, ministers, office. Reported by the head, heads of GUR and foreign intelligence service, the head of the SBU, the Secretarp.</p>
<p>The first question is the consequences of Russian blows, including missile. It was only in the past, from midnight to seven in the morning that 15 Russian rockets managed to bring down. But unfortunately, not everyone. Not all of them. We actively work with partners to the defense of our sky even more reliable.</p>
<p>They discussed at a morning meeting the likely behavior of the enemy in the near future, coordinated our defensive steps.</p>
<p>Separately - issues of weapons and shells for our soldiers. Also, the situation in the still occupied territory and counteraction to Russia. No chance of the occupier on our land!The enemy is only destruction.</p>
<p>Here's just one example today. Chernihiv region, the village of Lizunivka, is the North region, near the state border. There, the Russian aviation was destroyed by a still Ukrainian school ... Unfortunately, this blow took the life of a teenager - a guy of 2009 birth ... 14 years old!He was just near the school. My muddy and loved ones!</p>
<p>Pavlograd of Dnipropetrovsk region. Terrorists rockets have taken away the lives of two people, very young guys ... My condolences to families!More than forty people - women, children, men - received help after injuries and injuries.</p>
<p>For each such impact, Russian invaders will receive our answer. And I thank our warriors who provide it daily and every night. Which protect our position, reflect Russian assaults, help their fire brothers, who are in positions, and to the maximum destroy the occupier. The more Ukrainian comprehension, the more Ukrainian mutual support, the more Russian evil is building.</p>
