“Did you think that twice in one place the projectile does not hit? But not then, the artillerymen of the 71st Separate Eger Brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of Ukraine.

The invaders were convinced that they would not look for their hiding place in their destroyed homes. However, our "battle birds" were noticed and given to the coordinate unit.

The occupiers before "disposal" had to run from house to house - but the tamyh was caught up with the accurate shots. Only some of the more than a dozen Russians have tacked Bukhanka. The rest covered a 105th caliber projectile. "

On the live broadcast of the "Uniform News", the spokesman for the Air Force Colonel Yuriy Ignat spoke about the current situation in the sky of Ukraine, as well as how the territory of our country from the enemy's air -dactois is covered today and how the air defense system can change in the near future.

-In relation to this night, everyone was probably noticed by our telegram channel: the tsbul is one of those rare nights when complete silence prevailed,-says Yurignat. - Of course, as always, there is some activity of hostility, but they have not performed combat work. As of now, there are several enemy tactical aircraft aircraft: Su-34 and SU-35, and also Il-22 plane. They perform flights, including the occupied territory and water area of the Azov Sea.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-09T81-00-00-04-00/ignat-23.jpg)Yurignat. TV video frame

Colonel Yuri Ignat also answered the questions of the leading Telelorphone about what changes will be made about the cover from the air attacks by the Grand Distinist of Ukraine. The head of the public relations service of the Air Forces Command has explained that today the above military leadership of the state has been the most effective and most effective way of air cover. Millionic cities that have strategically important objects-all this is covered by anti-aircraft missile systems of Air Force. The rest of the country, according to Colonel Yuri Ignat, should be buzzing with aviation - hostile missiles should be intercepted by planes.

-The F-16 can take off from our airfields and intercept the goals over the entire territory of Ukraine,-the officer explains. -Ideally, at our borders. In addition, planes can control the airspace not only of Ukraine's adherence but also in the Black Sea, including to effectively act on enemy carbon rockets "Caliber".

The only thing, according to Yuri Ignatus, why aircraft cannot resist - brush weapons. But these tasks are solved by the modern Western anti-aircraft-rocket complexes of Patriot and SAMP-T, which are in service with domestic airborne air. The rest of the hostile rockets and shock drones should be destroyed by aviation. In particular, by acting on the carriers of this weapon before its use.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-09T86-00-00-04-00/7-chernyk.jpg)Military expert Petro Chernyk

Casette ammunition will become very noticeable for our defenders during the combatants, as well as in the process of demining the territories tightly replaced by Russian occupants, the military analyst Colonel Petro Chernik.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news."

-Cassette ammunition, it is such a weapon that has in its body, and is referred to a minimum of 72 elements, each element weighs 200 grams, and when the projectile enters the combat trajectory, undermines at an altitude of 15-20 meters, each element. It is more than the football field, sowing with this, - says the officer. - Why is this extremely important? Imagine that this football field, and if it is a forest strip - there are several pieces of equipment. They are very seriously disguised, and it will be very difficult to hunt them with a regular projectile. And this is especially true of the extermination of the power that is hidden in the trench of the armor, because these small elements are very convenient there. Thus, this arms is intended to raise the coefficient of lesions of living force, and most importantly - to harm the technique.

According to a military scientist, we are well aware that such an element can not be a tank, but it can damage it. And if the enemy does not export the enemy with the field, then the damaged motorcycle is spent on the damaged, and even more of the power. Therefore, these ammunition is designed to raise the level of destruction and equipment and living power as much as possible.

-Well, finally, they came to a symmetrical answer: the enemy for a very long time, especially in the equipment BM-21 "Grad", uses such ammunition-the statement of political sciences Petro Chernik.

As for the danger of non -break cassettes, for other soldiers who can theoretically blow out on them, capturing the enemy, for comparison, Colonel Petro Chernik cites the percentage of Russian and American ammunition of this type. In Russian it is 30, and in some places it reaches 40%, in US - a maximum of 1.5%, a part -time case - 3%.

The military expert also answered the question of the leading spoken studio maternity studio on the possibility of using cassette ammunition to displace the minefields installed by the enemy on a temporarily occupying territory.Also, according to the expert, there are heavy demining machines on the basis of a tank that have a heavy working body made from superhard alloys of metal, titanium, tungsten, and which are massively digging mines, while some of them are disrupted, some are not broken. But again, for the use of such technology, you need to push the enemy and its firearms as far as possible.

This was reported by the director of the consulting group "A95" Sergey Kuyun during the time briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.

“In May, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted Resolution No. 1147, which increased control of documentation for petroleum products. In particular, there is a requirement to provide a certificate of supply of the product, accordingly, this step had a result. For example, the depravities of diesel from Turkey have decreased by 50%. But we see another result. Gas and diesel suppliers have adapted, they began to establish quite normal certificates and, accordingly, again imported Ukraine with Russian products, ”Kuyun said.

According to him, the main Ukrainian suppliers, including Latvia, Lithuanian Tapolshch are large importers of Russian liquefied gas, also Turkey, which buys about a million tons of diesel in Russia in Russia.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-palne). So now it is about increasing control of the origin of petroleum products.

"It is important that the customs office has additional powers, in order not to simply release a certificate of origin, but also secondary documents, such as transport, which will show where the gas came from the supplier," the expert said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-10T22-07-37-03-00/630_360_1689015962-155.jpg)In times of Russia, the safety of vessels in the Black Sea from the Grain Agreement must guarantee or Turkey, or another country that will attract Turkish -Caste or UN.

This was stated in [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101819)Pavel Lakichuk, Head of the Security Protection Center "Strategy 21", Ukrinform reports.

The expert noted that the purpose of Russia during the signing of this Agreement was, formally permitting the supply of Ukrainian grain to African countries, to obtain political and economic dividends.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3733880-robota-zernovogo-koridoru-fakticno-zablokovana-z-kinca-cervna-ekspert.html)"They(RF - Ed.)In exchange for the signing of the grain agreement, Turkey, the issue of exports of Russian ammonia ammonia-provoctomatti-Odesa-Black Sea, when vessels were loaded on the Odessa port. The Russian Federation also wanted sanctions on exports of Russian mineral fees. But all these focuses of Russia failed, and Putin and his team realized that the way they wanted, the agreement did not work. It works but does not work with Timechanisms, which they put there as additional "mines," - said Lakichuk.

According to him, if Russia leaves the agreement, the guarantees of transit of marine trafficking in Ukrainian ports should be provided by the Navy or other states that are ready to involve both Turkish and UN. "They can decide on the use of a crushing contingent, for example, from the composition of a constant operational connection of NATO in the Mediterranean," Lakichuk said.

In his opinion, the Navy of Turkey is much more powerful than the Russian, so Ankara has every possible way to provide peace in the Black Sea water area when the Ukrainian grain is transported to Africa and Asia.

Now, although the Turks do not concentrate warships on a permanent basis in the marriage, they have powerful Navy, which ... far exceeds the possibilities of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation," the expert said.On the other hand, the expert noted, the Turkish side controls the Black Sea Protops, relying on the Montre Convention on the course of warships in the lady. "Even here, it depends a lot on the Turks, if the UN or other international organization decides to launch in the Black Sea initiative the escorting of vessels in the state," the expert said.

"If Turkey provides guarantees for the grain corridor, it will be a hard crime. The Turks are able to act rigidly, including the Russian Federation," the expert said.

In this connection, he reminded the situation in Syria in 2018, when the Turkish was knocked down by the Russian bomber: "It was a signal for Putin, and a squeak understood. A month or two Russians were crying out that would not buy Turkish apels and tomato Ankara, "Lakichuk said.

As it was reported, the grain agreement was concluded in July last year with the participation of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN, as well as separately - Turkey, the UN and Russia. Decitation guarantees a safe passage .

Russia threatens to withdraw from the grain agreement, if it does not succeed in the restoration of ammonia by the Tomatti - Odesa pipeline and partially removing restriction on its own export.The Government of Ukraine declared the actual blocking of the Russian side of grain. The Russian Federation opened the inspection of ships, which reduced the capacity of the corridor to less than 20% of the possible.

Russia confirmed its participation in the agreement at the end of May, extending its validity for 60 days - until July 17.

About it [reports](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3451329/nato-chief-details-plans-for-summit/)Pentagon press service.

President Joe Biden [joins](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/03/prezydent-ssha-dzho-bajden-prybude-na-samit-nato-u-vilnyusi/)The Heads of State and Government of the Alliance are covered by the moment of transatlantic security.

“Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine continues to rage. For 500 days, Moscow carried death and destruction into the heart of Europe, seeking to destroy Ukraine and separate NATO, ”Yen Stoltenberg said.

The summit sends a message to Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putinupro that the Alliance is the only one, and his aggression "[not blamed](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/07/vilnyuskyj-samit-nato-zrobyt-ukrayinu-sylnishoyu-gensek-alyansu/)”.

Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO allies have already promised to allocate 500 million euros for critical needs for Ukraine, including fuel, medical supply, demining equipment and pontoon bridges.

The Alliance leaders will also try to strengthen the protection and restraint with the help of three new regional defense plans, which oppose the main threat - Russia and terrorism.

Jens Stoltenberg also said that the plans of the summit would relate to the Atlantic of the Tai -European Arctic; Baltic region and Central Europe; as well as the Mediterranean and the Black Seas.

Alliance leaders will also consider a plan for defense production to negotiate demand, increase capacity and increase operational compatibility.

NATO allies will also make a more ambitious promise for the investment of the Vaboron - to spend a minimum of 2 percent of the gross internal product annually.

This was made possible after a real increase in defense costs among 31 units.

“In 2023, European allies and Canada will have a real increase in 8.3 percent. This is the highest in the decades and ninth years of a noisy of our defense costs, ”said Jens Stoltenberg.“This year 11 allies will reach or exceed the purpose. We expect that this number will increase significantly, ”the Alliance head said.

The leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will be involved in Uudamiti, as the Alliance's security is not regional but global.

"We are working closely on issues such as cybersecurity, safety of Nagri and new technologies," Yins Stoltenberg stressed.

He also noted that it will be the first summit of the Alliance, in which Finland will take the participation as an ally of NATO, and will also continue work with the fastest accession of Schwedia.

This summit was to be the last for Jens Stoltenberg as a Secretary General, but the Allies [asked](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/04/pivnichnoatlantychna-rada-prodovzhyla-povnovazhennya-yensa-stoltenberga-na-posadi-genseka-nato/)It is at least a year.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-10T3-07-37-03-00/630_360_1689015962-155.jpg)In times of Russia, the safety of vessels in the Black Sea from the Grain Agreement must guarantee or Turkey, or another country that will attract Turkish -Caste or UN.

This was stated in [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101819)Pavel Lakichuk, Head of the Security Protection Center "Strategy 21", Ukrinform reports.

The expert noted that the purpose of Russia during the signing of this Agreement was, formally permitting the supply of Ukrainian grain to African countries, to obtain political and economic dividends.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3733880-robota-zernovogo-koridoru-fakticno-zablokovana-z-kinca-cervna-ekspert.html)"They(RF - Ed.)In exchange for the signing of the grain agreement, Turkey, the issue of exports of Russian ammonia ammonia-provoctomatti-Odesa-Black Sea, when vessels were loaded on the Odessa port. The Russian Federation also wanted sanctions on exports of Russian mineral fees. But all these focuses of Russia failed, and Putin and his team realized that the way they wanted, the agreement did not work. It works but does not work with Timechanisms, which they put there as additional "mines," - said Lakichuk.

According to him, if Russia leaves the agreement, the guarantees of transit of marine trafficking in Ukrainian ports should be provided by the Navy or other states that are ready to involve both Turkish and UN. "They can decide on the use of a crushing contingent, for example, from the composition of a constant operational connection of NATO in the Mediterranean," Lakichuk said.

In his opinion, the Navy of Turkey is much more powerful than the Russian, so Ankara has every possible way to provide peace in the Black Sea water area when the Ukrainian grain is transported to Africa and Asia.

Now, although the Turks do not concentrate warships on a permanent basis in the marriage, they have powerful Navy, which ... far exceeds the possibilities of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation," the expert said.On the other hand, the expert noted, the Turkish side controls the Black Sea Protops, relying on the Montre Convention on the course of warships in the lady. "Even here, it depends a lot on the Turks, if the UN or other international organization decides to launch in the Black Sea initiative the escorting of vessels in the state," the expert said.

"If Turkey provides guarantees for the grain corridor, it will be a hard crime. The Turks are able to act rigidly, including the Russian Federation," the expert said.

In this connection, he reminded the situation in Syria in 2018, when the Turkish was knocked down by the Russian bomber: "It was a signal for Putin, and a squeak understood. A month or two Russians were crying out that would not buy Turkish apels and tomato Ankara, "Lakichuk said.

As it was reported, the grain agreement was concluded in July last year with the participation of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN, as well as separately - Turkey, the UN and Russia. Decitation guarantees a safe passage .

Russia threatens to withdraw from the grain agreement, if it does not succeed in the restoration of ammonia by the Tomatti - Odesa pipeline and partially removing restriction on its own export.The Government of Ukraine declared the actual blocking of the Russian side of grain. The Russian Federation opened the inspection of ships, which reduced the capacity of the corridor to less than 20% of the possible.

Russia confirmed its participation in the agreement at the end of May, extending its validity for 60 days - until July 17.

We observe this in ORDLO and in the Crimea, the person's development stopped back in 2014, when the accumulations were caught there.

As the head of the military intelligence of Ukraine, Major-General Kirilobudanov, “Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories for incomplete human life, has become a Cuba, where the communists have begun to power, and the country's degradation and isolation of the country, and the Kubid, and the Kubyan, have become a Cuba. Reserve stagnation. " Old American cars in Cuba remind that by 1953 and the rebellion of the Communists, there was a rapid economic life. And now innovations, neither investments, nor modern technology, nor important infrastructure.

Comparison of temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories with Cuba is very advisable. These territories should be released immediately to give Ukrainian citizens a chance to occupy the future. Otherwise, these territories will transform the mudic wild field of the 21st century, and humans and their fates - in hostages of imperial ambitions of Kremlin pupils.

Further destruction of obsolete infrastructure, falling social capital, total degradation of education, culture, science, lack of opportunities for any development-this is in fact the price of so-called liberation, which is lied by during the occupation of Ukrainian territories in 2014. The same "Cuba" is grown by the Putin regime in the Transnistria ghetto.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched some important reforms - from decentralization, when communities on the ground have received resources and powers for development, as well as administrative services. Ukrainians were given the opportunity to visit other countries of the world, including the European Union without obstacles. The country is socially integrated to the open democratic world.

«Тобто наразі суспільство нарешті консолідувалося з цього питання тадемонструє єдиний погляд», — наголосили в КМІС.

Лише 18% опитаних прийнятно буде відмовитися від вступу до НАТО зарадивстановлення миру, а для 76% така ціна є неприйнятною.

Також більшість українців перестала підтримувати заміну «гарантіями безпеки»повноцінного членства в НАТО.

«У травні 2022 року думки розділилися майже порівну: 39% наполягали на лишевступі до НАТО, а 42% вважали прийнятним отримати замість цього «безпековігарантії». До травня 2023 року громадська думка помітно змінилася — до 58%зросла частка тих, хто наполягає саме на членстві в НАТО.

The event became an integral part of the rehabilitation for the military units of the three Armed Forces of Ukraine, which, while on a short rest of the reflection, undergo psychological decompression in their hometown. They were joined by local residents and guests of friendly Lithuania. Correspondent ** [** Armyinform **](https://armyinform.com.ua/army-authors/anatolij-balchos/)** attended the event and talked with its participants. **

Ukrainian ethnic music as if a magnet was tightened by Irpen residents at the Star Nation Fund, located on the picturesque Berezhevlyak Lake. At the very edge of water, on a cozy wooden pier, cut with rocks from Rashist shelling, sang, danced traditional folkuple rites of artists of the band "Royal". The pioneering Kupala act prevailed on a makeshift stage on the water.

Ми показуємо у Литві всі ці руйнування, те, що пережили мужніукраїнці під час російської навали, як вони згуртувались та як завзятовідновлюють свою країну. Литовці історично дуже близькі Україні, тонковідчувають цей зв'язок, тому сильно переймаються її долею та допомагають.

So, Ukraine is on the eve of Vilnius. NATO Summit, which can become exactly the one that is needed by both our country and the whole alliance, global security.

We are extremely active these days!Even more active than ever. And although this work is almost one hundred percent now-behind the scenes, its value is not less than any public work.

Everyone understands everything. Every leader, every state. Even if different positions are voiced, it is obvious that Ukraine deserves to be in the Alliance. Not now is a war, but we need a clear signal. And the signal is needed right now.

I am grateful to all the leaders, every country who say that and who approved the corresponding joint declarations and statements with Ukraine regarding our integration. The largest alliance is clearly "for" us.

The courage of Ukrainian heroes has wiped away from dust of history all the values for which NATO was created.

It is the Ukrainian eastern border, the border of our country and the positions of our soldiers - this is the limit that never to cross the Russian dictatorship, which in various forms, but always always tried to conquer the peoples of Europe.

The security reality depends on Ukraine here on the Eastern Flanging of NATO. The Kolyma was applied for NATO entry, we said frankly: Ukraine already already in fact was the Alliance. Our weapons are an alliance weapon. Our values are what Viritans. Our protection is the element of the formula of Europe that makes it united, free and in peace.

Vilnius has to confirm all this.

Work on the warding is still ongoing, that is, on the specific words of such confirmation, but we already understand the fact that Ukraine will be in the Alliance, we work for the fact that the algorithm of membership becomes as clear and fast as possible. For the sake of this - the work of the whole team of Ukraine - will continue every minute of these days.

It is also very important that bilateral meetings of different levels are planned in Vilnius - European countries, America, Canada, Japan… Priorities are absolutely obvious - this is the air defense for our cities, for all communities throughout the country, we are working to create a full air shield. It is also a weapon for the front - there will be negotiations in Vilnius. Of course, let's talk about other aspects of life protection and our common safety.Separately - advanced.

Tomorrow, on the day of starting the summit, which is now unimaginable without Ukraine, there will be a full-scale war. It speaks a lot about our power - a force of Ukrainian people, which in such a war, after so many battles and days has a force, without which the safety of Europe - simply not imagine it.

I thank you, Ukrainian soldiers, for this power!Thank you every soldier, sailor, every sergeant, every officer, every officer, every general!I thank you who trains our warriors!Thank you to every volunteer!Doctors who have been preserved after injuries!I thank all our people who work for the Ukrainian Victory!

This is an honor for me - to represent such people and such Ukraine!

_**Glory to Ukraine!**_
