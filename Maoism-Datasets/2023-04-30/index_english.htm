<p>He stated this at a briefing in Prague after a visit to Ukraine, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>According to Pavel, the Ukrainian authorities do not expect approval at the summit in the Vilnitosis on Ukraine's membership in the Alliance.</p>

<p>It is noted that the developer team used computed tomography with 500 patients with large nodes in the lungs to develop an algorithm basis <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stucnij-intelekt"></a>with the help of radiomy. This technology can extract important information from medical images that are difficult to see the human eye.</p>
<p>Then the artificial intelligence model was tested to determine if it could accurately identify cancer nodes.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada Dmitry Lubinets said this in the Telelorphone "The One News", the correspondent of Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"I think this decree(Putin's decree allowing deportation from the temporary -heated territories of Ukrainians who did not take the citizenship of the Russian Federation - ed.)It is not exactly for the deportation of Ukrainians. This decree is aimed at providing forced certification, which takes place at the temporarily occupying territory of Ukraine. This is the first. And the second is to fix and put a point in this process. I think that all citizens of Ukraine who will give up the Russian passport are simply arrested. And this will be a separate category of civilian prisoners, which the Russian Federation will be held captive, in the imprisonment of the territory or in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, " - emphasized.</p>

<p>"I would advise you to take the Russian passport, however, to make a decision to take out. This is the most important. We understand that it happens under pressure, physical fit. So take a passport, survive, wait for we will release this. law-to officially get away from this passport and return to normal life. Or for a manner to make decisions and leave this territory in any way because of any territory of other countries, but simply leave. We understand that Caesarase is the issue of survival in this territory " , - said Lubin.</p>

The situation will not improve immediately. He added that the terrorist group receives 800 out of 4,000 shells a day.</p>
<p>“Prigogine is probably trying to restore access to more boost because <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin"></a>Again, performs transfers in the Russian military leadership in such a way that it can be in favor of Prigogine, ”experts say.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada Dmitry Lubinets said this in the Telelorphone "The One News", the correspondent of Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"I think this decree(Putin's decree allowing deportation from the temporary -heated territories of Ukrainians who did not take the citizenship of the Russian Federation - ed.)It is not exactly for the deportation of Ukrainians. This decree is aimed at providing forced certification, which takes place at the temporarily occupying territory of Ukraine. This is the first. And the second is to fix and put a point in this process. I think that all citizens of Ukraine who will give up the Russian passport are simply arrested. And this will be a separate category of civilian prisoners, which the Russian Federation will be held captive, in the imprisonment of the territory or in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, " - emphasized.</p>

<p>“These guarantees, of course, will not have the characteristics of a full article 5(The North Atlantic Union, which stipulates that an attack on a NATO single participant is an attack on all its members and will response to all states - ed.).

On the air of the Teleterna "One News" Air Force, Colonel Yuri Ignatus emphasized that the powerless Western multi -purpose fighters of the 4+ generation generation will be very difficult to protect our Ukraine. Both in peacetime and in wartime, Ukraine needs a air cover:</p>
<p>-Most importantly, the F-16 will help protect Ukrainians from air terrorism, as the aircraft will become an important component of the air defense system. Unfortunately, the process of waiting for Western aircraft is too expensive for Ukraine. It should also be understood that without preference in the air it is difficult to succeed during the time or offensive, as a multi -purpose fighter will support all defense forces. And we need to move to the de -occupation of Ukrainian territories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian pilots and land staff are actively improving the English language. To some extent, the airfield infrastructure is prepared.</p>
