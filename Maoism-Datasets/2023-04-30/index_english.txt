 Severe discussions in the world continue to unfold in the world about the possible transfer of the F-16 fighter to Ukraine. On the air of the Teleterna "One News" Air Force, Colonel Yuri Ignatus emphasized that the powerless Western multi -purpose fighters of the 4+ generation generation will be very difficult to protect our Ukraine. Both in peacetime and in wartime, Ukraine needs a air cover:
-Most importantly, the F-16 will help protect Ukrainians from air terrorism, as the aircraft will become an important component of the air defense system. Unfortunately, the process of waiting for Western aircraft is too expensive for Ukraine. It should also be understood that without preference in the air it is difficult to succeed during the time or offensive, as a multi -purpose fighter will support all defense forces. And we need to move to the de -occupation of Ukrainian territories.
