I wish you a speedy unfortunate to anyone who was injured in this blow is injured.

We are preparing some important, powerful steps to more consolidate partners and give more energy to create a tribunal against Russian aggression. And to accelerate the defeat of the terrorist state.

Ukraine and the world are not enough for Russia to be weak, as it is already giving away. It is necessary for her to fully respond to her.

We also prepare new sanction decisions for persons and companies working for VLK terrorists for foreign entities whose supply helps Russia to feed this aggression. Soon these decisions will be made public.

The explosion on the enemy oil depot, which was heard on April 29 near the Cossack Bay of the Vokupopol Sevastopol, destroyed more than 10 tanks with a 40,000 tonnes of petroleum products.

As [reports](https://gur.gov.ua/content/vybukhy-v-sevastopoli-kara-bozha-za-uman.html)The MOV Intelligence Directorate, a representative of GUR Andriy Yusov informed about it in a comment to RBC-Ukraine.

According to him, the destroyed petroleum products were intended for the Black Sea Fleth of the aggressor state.

Cotton in Sevastopol is God's punishment, in particular for killed civilian citizens of Vumani, including five children. This punishment will be long -lasting. It is desirable to all residents of the occupied Crimea in the near future not to be near the Zaya objects and objects that provide the army of the aggressor, ‚ÄùAndrei Yusov said.

A representative of military intelligence added that Ukraine is aware of the scale of theft on the affected oil and oil depot in Sevastopol and other similar Crimean sites. As Yusov explained, these facts are certainly expanding the possibility of Ukraine's security and defense forces.

He stated this at a briefing in Prague after a visit to Ukraine, reports Ukrinform.

According to Pavel, the Ukrainian authorities do not expect approval at the summit in the Vilnitosis on Ukraine's membership in the Alliance.

"What is waiting in Ukraine is the utterance of unambiguous support of allies and what they call security guarantees," the Czech leader said.

He noted that such guarantees of Kyiv intensively work together with the Second Secretary [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)Anders Fug Rasmussen. According to Pavel, the document has already been discussed with the Allies.

‚ÄúThese guarantees, of course, will not have the characteristics of a full article 5(The North Atlantic Union, which stipulates that an attack on a NATO single participant is an attack on all its members and will response to all states - ed.). –ê–ª–µ –º–∏ –º–æ–∂–µ–º–æ –ø–æ–¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è –Ω–∞ –≥–∞—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—ñ—ó –≤ —Ä—ñ–∑–Ω–∏—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ö, —è–∫—ñ–±—É–ª–æ –Ω–∞–¥–∞–Ω–æ –§—ñ–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥—ñ—ó –ø—ñ—Å–ª—è –æ–≥–æ–ª–æ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –Ω–µ—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω—ñ–≤ –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏—Ç–∏ –≤ –ê–ª—å—è–Ω—Å, ‚Ä¶ –∞–±–æ –Ω–∞–º–æ–¥–µ–ª—å –Ü–∑—Ä–∞—ó–ª—é¬ª, - —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç.

The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada Dmitry Lubinets said this in the Telelorphone "The One News", the correspondent of Ukrinform reports.

"I think this decree(Putin's decree allowing deportation from the temporary -heated territories of Ukrainians who did not take the citizenship of the Russian Federation - ed.)It is not exactly for the deportation of Ukrainians. This decree is aimed at providing forced certification, which takes place at the temporarily occupying territory of Ukraine. This is the first. And the second is to fix and put a point in this process. I think that all citizens of Ukraine who will give up the Russian passport are simply arrested. And this will be a separate category of civilian prisoners, which the Russian Federation will be held captive, in the imprisonment of the territory or in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, " - emphasized.

"I would advise you to take the Russian passport, however, to make a decision to take out. This is the most important. We understand that it happens under pressure, physical fit. So take a passport, survive, wait for we will release this. law-to officially get away from this passport and return to normal life. Or for a manner to make decisions and leave this territory in any way because of any territory of other countries, but simply leave.

Although the current and proposed new version of the Constitution limits the number of presidential terms in a row, officials have stated that if the Constitution is approved, the number of Mirzioev's terms will be fixed.

The reform also increases the presidential term to seven years out of five, which theoretically can allow Mirzioev to stay headed by the country with 35 million notes until 2040.

Each year, hundreds of thousands of people come from the whole island to fill the area of revolution in the Havana capital on the International Day of Solidarity.

This year's abolition of the traditional parade on May 1 has been the first time since the revolution of 1959, when the celebration was abolished for economic reasons.

In recent weeks, long -range queues have been formed at the gas station because of a fuel deficiency, and drivers often have to wait a few days to fill the tank of their own vehicles.

On the air of the Teleterna "One News" Air Force, Colonel Yuri Ignatus emphasized that the powerless Western multi -purpose fighters of the 4+ generation generation will be very difficult to protect our Ukraine. Both in peacetime and in wartime, Ukraine needs a air cover:

-Most importantly, the F-16 will help protect Ukrainians from air terrorism, as the aircraft will become an important component of the air defense system. Unfortunately, the process of waiting for Western aircraft is too expensive for Ukraine. It should also be understood that without preference in the air it is difficult to succeed during the time or offensive, as a multi -purpose fighter will support all defense forces. And we need to move to the de -occupation of Ukrainian territories.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian pilots and land staff are actively improving the English language. To some extent, the airfield infrastructure is prepared.
