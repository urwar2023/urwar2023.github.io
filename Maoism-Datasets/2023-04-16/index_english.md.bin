As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](http://www.dw.com/uk/ugorsina-slidom-za-polseu-zaboronila-import-agroprodukcii-z-ukraini/a-65336337)Identify to the Hungarian government.

"The government is committed to defending the interests of the Hungarian farm community, so in the absence of significant EU measures, it temporarily, like Poland, prohibits the import of grain and oilseeds, as well as a number of other farm products from Ukraine to Hungary," the Minister of Economy said.

He added that agricultural producers in Ukraine use methods that are used in the EU, which enables them to avoid unnecessary costs and export the high amount of poultry, eggs and medullase and oilseeds to the European market. As a consequence, the farmers of Central Evpepa have no opportunity to sell their own products, said Nadi.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ugorsina), Import ban will last until June 30 this year.

"Budapest expects that the EU will review the temporary abolition of Ukrainian goods by this term and provide fair market conditions for the European -aged economy," the statement said.

As reported by Ukrinform, Polish agrarians over the last few months have conducted mass protests, in particular, opposed to transportation through the territory of Poland to the third countries of Ukrainian agricultural products.

For many of her acquaintances, he is a mystery as such an extraordinary woman could join the police battalion "Lugansk-1". It should be clarified that this Batalion was not a simple patrolman, but the only one who served at "zeros", that is, on the very "line of demarcation": here ours, on the left bank of the Donets, Aza River, on the elevation - "separa". There were quite often artillery, and mines, and the attempts of the DRG to break into the controlled territory. Irina Gordievich served this battalion from 2014 to 2022.

The school continued his studies at Chernivtsi University. Someone can think that the atmosphere of the "Bandera" region has pushed Irina to such a hyradical change in life. But - no. She lived in Greece, was married and Malasin, on the Greek manner of named Alexandros. She has a few foreign languages.

They formed their own battalion, but people were not enough, and they were brought to Lugansk-1,-says Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Tverdohlib. After the death of the first commander Sergei Gubanov in May 2020, he took the command of the Batalion. Today, Alexander is the commander of the assault regiment of the brigade "Fury".

In the same way, it was "simply" killed by a break of the projectile. According to the other, she found herself a crooked environment in the premises of the city police department. It was demanded to take care of it, and when she refused, they were thrown into grenades. Typically, most of those who knew it agree with it, because such determination fully answered the style of her life ... and death.

What everyone agrees - that the body was searched when ours came to happiness for a short time and transferred to the morgue. But the next day the Russians reached and taken it to Lugansk. Apparently, they felt sacred ... findings.

- Then, when the enemies gave the body at the end of last year, our experts have expert. It was she, - summed up the commander.

Valentin Tkalich knew Irina better. In the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel was a press of a presoffitzer, although, like everyone, he was on duty on checkpoints, went with night -patrols and even went to "hunt" with an anti -saving unit. The Jacoblik of the Press Service he often represented Irina to various shooting groups(a woman in the war, especially so beautiful and educated - a lucky piece of journalists; In addition, she went through the career path of the sentry fighter to the senior lieutenant in the short term). –ü–µ—Ä—à–µ, –ø—Ä–æ —â–æ –≤—ñ–Ω –∑–≥–∞–¥–∞–≤ ‚Äì —Ü–µ –ø—Ä–æ —ó—ó‚Ä¶–∫—É–ª—ñ–Ω–∞—Ä–Ω—ñ –∑–¥—ñ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ.

Irina had to mention her culinary capacity acquired abroad. She was preparing such a European sophistication that no one could realize that we were eating. And she was getting on the verge: to be her own for men, and at the same time to become a woman. And she was not brutal, because she often happens to be situations that women try on a male image. No. She is a bog - and she was her own. Interestingly, she had a feeling of beautiful. She died to something so‚Ä¶ good. She loved the photos.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/04/dc2c72b450c2-g-7-to-agree-on-need-to-diversify-fuel-sources-push-decarbonization.html).

At the same time, it is noted that during a meeting in the Japanese city of Sapporo, there was a failed agreement to set the deadline to stop the use of carbon energy.

Japan, who headed the meeting, did not want to coordinate specific time frames to stop use [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vugilla)Considering the probable need for this energy source for at least a majority of the 2030s. The United Kingdom and Canada are trying to stop the Tsuprakics.

The ministers confirmed their commitment to the "complete or predominant" decarbonization of the energy sector by 2035. This is stated in the issued Komunik after a meeting on climate, energy and the environment.

During the meeting, the G7 member states gradually agreed to give up the fuel, including gas, oil and coal, in the energy sector.

Ministers have also reached collective consent to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for vehicles by at least 50% by 2035 or earlier.

The G7 meeting was the first series of meetings at the ministers of the pre -Ukraine ministers in Hiroshima, which are focused on the ways of achieving carbon -neutrality by 2050 by reducing the dependence on fossil fuel expanding the use of renewable energy sources.

It is also clear from the audio recording that the occupiers feel "as an environment" in their positions through shelling by the Ukrainian military. At the same time, the Russian woman is that they have nothing to oppose the Ukrainian forces of defense - they have no nyazchet, nor technology.

"They do not touch us, why touch us?" The platoon is small, no use of us. We are no technique, there is nothing that we oppose them? Nothing!They do not translate the shells of Nanas.

** _ Great people of the Great Country!_ **

At the end of last winter, Russia brought a full -scale war to our land. And despair - death, pain and darkness. In the morning of February 24, the sun never descended. Dawn has not come. On the morning of February 24, a dark night began. At the same time, the cheerfulness began. Our struggle.

Darkness could not overshadow our spirit, the desire of will, the love of our native land and the readiness to protect it.

We kept the light inside ourselves. Panic, fear, strife won. We united. Millions of outbreaks in millions of Ukrainian hearts have become a great campfire. In this fire, our power and indomitability were hardened, this fire did not extinguish our hope and faith, this fire saw the whole world.

Then we won despair, despair, fatigue, pain. Millions of lights in the eyes of Ukrainians merged into one powerful ray of light. He helped to fear in darkness, not to go out of the road, shone through the right goal.

This is what different generations have fought for different centuries. For which the last years and 417 days have given their lives our warriors of light - defenders and defenders of Ukraine.

What we fight against the dark forces today. This is our dawn. The rebellion. This is an outance of an independent Ukraine.

Today we celebrate the feast of the Resurrection of the Lord. His main symbol is the victory: the victory of good, the victory of truth, the victory of life. We meet Easter with the steadfast in the irreversibility of these victories.

On this day, a year ago, we all prayed to keep Ukraine. Today - that Ukraine has won. We not only wait and ask, but we get and create this winner ourselves. 417 days. We have already gone a considerable way. Ahead of us or unmistakable from the peaks. We will overcome it. And together we will meet our dawn. When the sun will rise. It's a blue-yellow flag. He will inevitably rise throughout our God. On all temporarily occupied territories. Our flag is overwhelmed by the shores of the Azov Sea of the Isaersky Donets, above the heels and Ai-Petri. The sun shines in the south, the sun is in the east, the sun shines in the Crimea. The orange sun in the peaceful blue sky, and it is the light of justice.

It is the light of reunification of people and families. Ukrainians. Everyone who is now at the front, Ivsih, who helps them in the rear. The glow of the smiles of the winners and their families. Lightboy orders of heroes who will return. The glitter of happy eyes of parents, children, loved ones and loved ones who wait.It is the light of truth and truth. The triumph of law and justice. The prosecution of reference and punishment of all who gave and obey criminal orders. All who killed, tortured, robbed and responded both in the international tribunal and in the court of God.

Heaven see our faith and firmness. The world sees our courage and indomitability. The war sees our strength and determination. So, Ukraine will see the light of victory.

She unites all of us. Always, and especially today. On Easter, a family holiday, a day of heat, hope and a great union for Ukrainians. The war could not erase us, our values, our traditions, our holy those of the most important things they symbolize.

And so where we celebrate the Easter, at least where each of us is now - we are Mizi Easter together.

We are one big family. Ukrainians. We have one big home. Ukraine. We have a single goal. Victory. To all.

Those who are no longer with us who gave life for Ukraine. We remember everyone, and we will seek in God their souls. We believe in anyone who continues to defeat the wrestlers and ask God to protect them and protect them.

We fight our best for our land and ask for the assistance of heavenly forces. The prayers who spoke our ancestors before the battle. Who help and save our warriors today.

_Sew the veil of Christ, _

_Shkira is a shell iron, _

_krov - ore is strong, bone - sword blink._

_ More arrows, vigilant Falcon._

_Bron on me._

_Hide in me._

_To was tomorrow._

_Shok was a peaceful dawn._

_Shok was a victory._

_Sto was Ukraine._

**_Christ is Risen!He is Risen Indeed!_**

Congress gave permission for Taiwan's total annual assistance of $ 3 billion in the framework of a law -produlement resolution for defense for the 2023 financial year.

The Pentagon intends to use a $ 1 billion permit to transfer weapons to the same mechanism that the United States used to transfer equipment to Ukraine. The presidential authority would allow Taiwan's military equipment to be transferred immediately as it comes directly to US military reserves.

The delivery of Taiwan's weapons is part of Washington's efforts to restrain possible attack on the island. After all, Beijing constantly emphasizes what Taiwan considers his territory, and promised to release it with force, if necessary.

In addition to the presidential powers, another high -ranking official of the Penthane said Congress that the Department also wants Congress to send $ 2 billion to Taiwan's military assistance under the FMF program, which is managed by the State Department. This initiative allow other countries to buy US military equipment through grants or loans.

Dear citizens, follow the curfew and do not leave the routes - the enemy shoots civilian cars. Biza, by police, organizes an evacuation with a subsequent settlement - a chance to save your life.

Do not lift unknown items and do not touch unobtrusive shells. Call the pyrotechnics by phone 101.

We warn of fraudulent schemes during the war, including rental, search for relatives, etc. Follow simple rules to protect yourself from scammers.

Already, the preparation of the 25 Ukrainian military chaplain has already been prepared for the preparation of the 25 Ukrainian military chaplain. They will be prepared for two weeks of Napoligon, where our servicemen are usually trained, - said Alexeiereshchuk.

He noted that we have an extremely interesting US experience, because the chaplain service has been existing for over 200 years.

- In addition, we recently had a meeting with the British partners on the ORBITAL programs, where we decided that we would launch the chaplains to prepare the chaplains. As our ordinary servicemen train in Britain, the chaplains will also come there. Even after that, we will have some kind of where to move and how to develop our preparation, - said Alexei Tereshchuk.

The Head of the Military Chaplaincy also reported that in June, our military chaplains may be invited to prepare for South Korea.

- It was very important for us to get acquainted with the experience of preparing the Southern Korea, because there is also a very powerful Chaplain Service, which is similar to the distribution of confessional affiliation. That is, there is a dummy religious organization and the rest. I also predict that somewhere in June they will ask for training, - said Alexei Tereshchuk.

How are you kept and are ready for use? For example, we are aware of the cases, which were released from the territory of Russia, did not fly to Ukraine, Ababulated in the territory of the aggressor country itself.

Russia originated as an anti -Western political state in the tenth century, when its first right cities and dynasties decided to convert to Orthodoxy.

The Russians could capture Bakhmut much earlier, but there was a preliminary decision to do so.

Douglas McGregor, Scott Ritter, Daniel L. Davis, Andriy Martyanov and Jacques Bo are true military and intelligence professionals who believe that the Russians win the war.

V. Zelensky is ready to transfer Poland to several western regions of the country to the exchange of large -scale military assistance in the "capture" of Crimea.

Ukraine is losing a conflict on exhaustion, because Baiden administration instead of martial negotiations only "throws" Ukraine with weapons, hoping that it will help to win.

Ukraine's spring counter -offensive is a deadly trap for the US and NATO.

Thanks to the "special operation", Russia dispelled the myth of the invincibility of the event.
