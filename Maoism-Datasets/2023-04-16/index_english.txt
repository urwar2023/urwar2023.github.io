🔶 Manipulation

🔶 misinformation
❌ Polish journalist Anna Kramer said in an article by NDP: “Thanks to the Special Operations, Russia has dispelled the myth of invincibility of the event. NATO headed by Sysha is a classic example of a "paper tiger": it is only dangerous to the first review, but in the event of a real threat is not able to do anything serious.

 It was a full -scale Russian invasion on the first day of a full -scale Russian invasion of a promising name - happiness ...
For many of her acquaintances, he is a mystery as such an extraordinary woman could join the police battalion "Lugansk-1". It should be clarified that this Batalion was not a simple patrolman, but the only one who served at "zeros", that is, on the very "line of demarcation": here ours, on the left bank of the Donets, Aza River, on the elevation - "separa". There were quite often artillery, and mines, and the attempts of the DRG to break into the controlled territory. Irina Gordievich served this battalion from 2014 to 2022.
 She was born, apparently, in the most romantic corner of the Carpathians - in Kosovo. The school continued his studies at Chernivtsi University. Someone can think that the atmosphere of the "Bandera" region has pushed Irina to such a hyradical change in life. But - no. She lived in Greece, was married and Malasin, on the Greek manner of named Alexandros. She has a few foreign languages.
 When the Revolution of Dignity began, Irina changed the comfortable life of the Zamidan tent. And with the beginning of the war she enrolled in the police battalion "Chernivtsi".
 -In the battalion I saw Irina from the first days as soon as they came from Chernivtsi. They formed their own battalion, but people were not enough, and they were brought to Lugansk-1,-says Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Tverdohlib. After the death of the first commander Sergei Gubanov in May 2020, he took the command of the Batalion. Today, Alexander is the commander of the assault regiment of the brigade "Fury".
 
 … The death of a senior police lieutenant Irina Gordievich is told differently, because the first day of the invasion was marked by a complete confusion. In the same way, it was "simply" killed by a break of the projectile. According to the other, she found herself a crooked environment in the premises of the city police department. It was demanded to take care of it, and when she refused, they were thrown into grenades. Typically, most of those who knew it agree with it, because such determination fully answered the style of her life ... and death.
What everyone agrees - that the body was searched when ours came to happiness for a short time and transferred to the morgue. But the next day the Russians reached and taken it to Lugansk. Apparently, they felt sacred ... findings.
Valentin Tkalich knew Irina better. In the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel was a press of a presoffitzer, although, like everyone, he was on duty on checkpoints, went with night -patrols and even went to "hunt" with an anti -saving unit. The Jacoblik of the Press Service he often represented Irina to various shooting groups(a woman in the war, especially so beautiful and educated - a lucky piece of journalists; In addition, she went through the career path of the sentry fighter to the senior lieutenant in the short term). Перше, про що він згадав – це про її…кулінарні здібності.
 "In the 16th year," thanks "of the regional authorities, the battalion remained wireless support. Irina had to mention her culinary capacity acquired abroad. She was preparing such a European sophistication that no one could realize that we were eating. And she was getting on the verge: to be her own for men, and at the same time to become a woman. And she was not brutal, because she often happens to be situations that women try on a male image. No. She is a bog - and she was her own. Interestingly, she had a feeling of beautiful. She died to something so… good. She loved the photos. When blossoms blossomed, she went to the field on the first occasion. There, under happiness, then they blossomed in the steppe ”……
 Tkalich knew that Irina intended to continue his service.
 It should be noted here that such a woman could not but have ambitions. She, already in the war, entered the Faculty of Law - hoped to get to work in Interpol later(Knowledge of English would be useful).
– Якось до мене звернулась телекомпанія. Їм треба було репортаж зробити, і я зними поїхав. Забрали їх на блокпосту. Приїхали в Старий Айдар, почали знімати.І тут підбігають якісь солдати – побачили, що ми там знімаємо, підбігли йпочали нас класти на землю. Конкретної роботи в них тоді не було, і вонизнайшли собі забаву... Я кажу: «Ми зі зброєю, ви зі зброєю. Ми поліцейські, ви– військові»… Чим би все скінчилось, невідомо, та їй вдалось розрулитиконфлікт. Зуміла знайти потрібні слова. Останній раз я її бачив у 2019 році навиборах. Вона чергувала на мосту. Поговорили про життя, про плани на майбутнє.Вірю, що вона не здалася – це перше. А по-друге – не злякалась. Не знаю, яквсе сталося. Кажуть, вона охороняла відділення. Там її й убили.

_ Great people of the Great Country!_ 
At the end of last winter, Russia brought a full -scale war to our land. And despair - death, pain and darkness. In the morning of February 24, the sun never descended. Dawn has not come. On the morning of February 24, a dark night began. At the same time, the cheerfulness began. Our struggle.
Darkness could not overshadow our spirit, the desire of will, the love of our native land and the readiness to protect it.
We kept the light inside ourselves. Panic, fear, strife won. We united. Millions of outbreaks in millions of Ukrainian hearts have become a great campfire. In this fire, our power and indomitability were hardened, this fire did not extinguish our hope and faith, this fire saw the whole world.
Then we won despair, despair, fatigue, pain. Millions of lights in the eyes of Ukrainians merged into one powerful ray of light. He helped to fear in darkness, not to go out of the road, shone through the right goal.
This is what different generations have fought for different centuries. For which the last years and 417 days have given their lives our warriors of light - defenders and defenders of Ukraine.
What we fight against the dark forces today. This is our dawn. The rebellion. This is an outance of an independent Ukraine.
Today we celebrate the feast of the Resurrection of the Lord. His main symbol is the victory: the victory of good, the victory of truth, the victory of life. We meet Easter with the steadfast in the irreversibility of these victories.
On this day, a year ago, we all prayed to keep Ukraine. Today - that Ukraine has won. We not only wait and ask, but we get and create this winner ourselves. 417 days. We have already gone a considerable way. Ahead of us or unmistakable from the peaks. We will overcome it. And together we will meet our dawn. When the sun will rise. It's a blue-yellow flag. He will inevitably rise throughout our God. On all temporarily occupied territories. Our flag is overwhelmed by the shores of the Azov Sea of the Isaersky Donets, above the heels and Ai-Petri. The sun shines in the south, the sun is in the east, the sun shines in the Crimea. The orange sun in the peaceful blue sky, and it is the light of justice.
It is the light of reunification of people and families. Ukrainians. Everyone who is now at the front, Ivsih, who helps them in the rear. The glow of the smiles of the winners and their families. Lightboy orders of heroes who will return. The glitter of happy eyes of parents, children, loved ones and loved ones who wait.It is the light of truth and truth. The triumph of law and justice. The prosecution of reference and punishment of all who gave and obey criminal orders. All who killed, tortured, robbed and responded both in the international tribunal and in the court of God.
Heaven see our faith and firmness. The world sees our courage and indomitability. The war sees our strength and determination. So, Ukraine will see the light of victory.
She unites all of us. Always, and especially today. On Easter, a family holiday, a day of heat, hope and a great union for Ukrainians. The war could not erase us, our values, our traditions, our holy those of the most important things they symbolize.
And so where we celebrate the Easter, at least where each of us is now - we are Mizi Easter together.
We are one big family. Ukrainians. We have one big home. Ukraine. We have a single goal. Victory. To all.
Those who are no longer with us who gave life for Ukraine. We remember everyone, and we will seek in God their souls. We believe in anyone who continues to defeat the wrestlers and ask God to protect them and protect them.
We fight our best for our land and ask for the assistance of heavenly forces. The prayers who spoke our ancestors before the battle. Who help and save our warriors today.
_Sew the veil of Christ, _
_Shkira is a shell iron, _
krov - ore is strong, bone - sword blink. 
_ More arrows, vigilant Falcon._
Bron on me. 
Hide in me.

Shok was a peaceful dawn. 
Shok was a victory. 
Sto was Ukraine.

 The US Department of Defense plans to take advantage of the powers of Taiwan's weapons. Congress gave permission for Taiwan's total annual assistance of $ 3 billion in the framework of a law -produlement resolution for defense for the 2023 financial year.
The Pentagon intends to use a $ 1 billion permit to transfer weapons to the same mechanism that the United States used to transfer equipment to Ukraine. The presidential authority would allow Taiwan's military equipment to be transferred immediately as it comes directly to US military reserves.
The delivery of Taiwan's weapons is part of Washington's efforts to restrain possible attack on the island. After all, Beijing constantly emphasizes what Taiwan considers his territory, and promised to release it with force, if necessary.
 The representative of the American-Talawan Business Council, noted that the presidential authorities do not guarantee a complete solution to the problem, but even such a step is a good useful for Taiwan in terms of his safety.
In addition to the presidential powers, another high -ranking official of the Penthane said Congress that the Department also wants Congress to send $ 2 billion to Taiwan's military assistance under the FMF program, which is managed by the State Department. This initiative allow other countries to buy US military equipment through grants or loans.

Вперше цей процес став повністю офіційним та відкритим наскільки дозволяєбезпека.
Весною 2022 оперативно були прийняті всі необхідні закони, постанови, наказита запущений новий ефективний цивілізований державний механізм обміну таповодження з військовополоненими.
11 березня 2022 був створений Координаційний штаб з питань поводження звійськовополоненими при Головному управлінні розвідки Міноборони. Штабкоординує діяльність більше десяти державних інституцій, що беруть участь упроцесах обміну та поводження з військовополоненими.

 The Center for Combating Misinformation on its Facebook page reported About fakes common with hostile propagandists.
Russia originated as an anti -Western political state in the tenth century, when its first right cities and dynasties decided to convert to Orthodoxy.
The Russians could capture Bakhmut much earlier, but there was a preliminary decision to do so.
Douglas McGregor, Scott Ritter, Daniel L. Davis, Andriy Martyanov and Jacques Bo are true military and intelligence professionals who believe that the Russians win the war.
V. Zelensky is ready to transfer Poland to several western regions of the country to the exchange of large -scale military assistance in the "capture" of Crimea.
Ukraine is losing a conflict on exhaustion, because Baiden administration instead of martial negotiations only "throws" Ukraine with weapons, hoping that it will help to win.
Ukraine's spring counter -offensive is a deadly trap for the US and NATO.
Thanks to the "special operation", Russia dispelled the myth of the invincibility of the event.
