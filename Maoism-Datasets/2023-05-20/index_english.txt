 The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine held a working meeting to discuss the issues of food for the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The event was presented by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Denis Sharapov, participated in the representatives of the authorized units of the Ministry of Defense, the Armed Forces, members of the Anti -Corruption Council and market participants. The meeting presented the order of organization and procurement of food products for the needs of the Armed Forces in 2023.
 At the beginning of the event, Deputy Minister of Defense Denis Sharapov noted the positive fact of a broad representation of stakeholders of business, suppliers, retailers who responded to the proposal to participate in a work meeting. He announced that the Ministry of Defense plans to announce the bidding on the organization of food for armed servicemen. The attendees were familiar with the basic principles that such purchases would be held.
He also reported that a collegial body was created in the defense department, which will carry out the trading procedures and selection of winners.
 Maxim Gritsenko noted that at the beginning of a large -scale invasion of food suppliers were critically limited to feed the army that increased significantly.
In particular, the subject of purchasing food kits will be divided into 22 lots, with the compulsory compliance with the principle of "food goes for the military". That is, products must be supplied where the military unit is from the list of the relevant contract.
According to Maxim Gritsenko, it is quite optimistic that multi -companies participated in a working meeting.
The active participants in the working meeting were members of the Public Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense.
Upon completion of the working meeting, the representative of the Public Anti -Corruption Council, Olegsirko, noted the constructive position of the defense department on the Organization of Nutrition of the Armed Forces.
 - Speaking of a food system, it is advanced. This is, in fact, the system of NATO's armies, which in 2015 was somewhat hurriedly implemented. It is because of the rush that the problems that now lead to scandals have arisen. The army needs to be fed today, and in order to improve the number of transparency, it takes time and calculations. What I see azaraz is undoubtedly a way forward. Today we have seen the intermediate system of food organizations of the Armed Forces, which still needs improvement. But the design position of the Ministry of Defense in this matter is most important, - said OlegSirko.

“Therefore, at the same time as the process of starting the register of losses, active work continues to create the two other components of a special compensation mechanism - the Compensation Commission and the Compensation Fund. In particular, it is the burial and search of legal structures that will be the basis of the international agreement, on the basis of which a special compensation mechanism will be based. In spite of all the evil and grief that the aggressor brought, it must be held accountable in strict responsibility to the requirements of international law.

In addition, the Statute has already determined the structure of governing bodies and supervision of the activities of the registers. After the creation of a register is legally enshrined, the miracles were actively drawn up - solving the same practical issues as necessary for its practical launch, ”the Wise said.
According to her, the register will also have an auxiliary office in Ukraine to go to the Government of Ukraine and facilitate the dissemination of information with potential applicants and the public in Ukraine as a whole, in particular, regarding the existence and purpose of the Register and Procedure for Submission of Damage.
“The register will accept and process information about the notes of damages, information confirming such losses provided to individuals, legal entities, as well as the state of Ukraine. All data will be categorized with trimatized, and they will be assessed for the suitability of the claim in the registry for the purpose of their future consideration and the decision on compensation. The register will have no functions for consideration of such applications, including the definition of liability and award of any payments of chipcompensation, ”she explained.
