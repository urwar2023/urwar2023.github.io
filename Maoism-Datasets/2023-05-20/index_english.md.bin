The event was presented by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Denis Sharapov, participated in the representatives of the authorized units of the Ministry of Defense, the Armed Forces, members of the Anti -Corruption Council and market participants. The meeting presented the order of organization and procurement of food products for the needs of the Armed Forces in 2023.

He announced that the Ministry of Defense plans to announce the bidding on the organization of food for armed servicemen. The attendees were familiar with the basic principles that such purchases would be held.

- I am glad to see that we have many representatives of potential suppliers at the meeting. The other day, we begin the procedure for purchasing food for the Armed Forces for the second half of 2023, - said Denis Sharapov, Deputy Ministers of Ukraine.

He also reported that a collegial body was created in the defense department, which will carry out the trading procedures and selection of winners.

- the function of organizing and conducting purchases for the needs of the Armed Forces, publishing information on procurement and consideration of proposals of suppliers for the provisions is entrusted to the collegial body - the commission of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement in the direction of rear support. It is an independent body that is not affected by the Ministry of Defense officials. The commission will determine the technical ironing requirements and submit an announcement for publication in the systemiprozorro. I will note that the commission also includes representatives of the Public Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense. Unlike the previous ones, the current procedure provides open and transparent bidding with the use of Prozorro's mass system, - said Denis Sharapov.

- Now we give all those who want to apply for bidding, offer an adequate price and adhere to all the criteria. Among the innovations is the introduction of marginal prices, which aims to prevent deliberate prices by the supplier to certain categories of products, - Maximgritsenko added.

In particular, the subject of purchasing food kits will be divided into 22 lots, with the compulsory compliance with the principle of "food goes for the military". That is, products must be supplied where the military unit is from the list of the relevant contract.

According to Maxim Gritsenko, it is quite optimistic that multi -companies participated in a working meeting.

- I hope that in the near future they will provide their offers and thanks to the competition we will receive quality food at a weighted price, - said Maxim Gritsenko.

The active participants in the working meeting were members of the Public Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense.

Upon completion of the working meeting, the representative of the Public Anti -Corruption Council, Olegsirko, noted the constructive position of the defense department on the Organization of Nutrition of the Armed Forces.

This is, in fact, the system of NATO's armies, which in 2015 was somewhat hurriedly implemented. It is because of the rush that the problems that now lead to scandals have arisen. The army needs to be fed today, and in order to improve the number of transparency, it takes time and calculations. What I see azaraz is undoubtedly a way forward. Today we have seen the intermediate system of food organizations of the Armed Forces, which still needs improvement. But the design position of the Ministry of Defense in this matter is most important, - said OlegSirko.

Lubinets reminded that this "famous thesis" was immediately adopted by Russian propaganda.

"He noted that the Russian Federation used 100% of the report in its propaganda. It has become more than the beginning of Russian aggression, which began since 2014. The number of information tocks of negative nature we received as a state was not yet. As comparing Ukraine with an aggressor state, they directly played the Russian Federation, " - said the Ombudsman.

He noted that Russia began this shameful war, killing our citizens daily, and information from the Amnesty International report was used precisely options of Ukraine and Ukrainians.

Lubinets stated that it was not at all surprised that Amnesty International had a reputational loss, its benches were left by authoritative people, and the reports are now unnoticed, uninteresting to society, non -authoritative.

According to the Ombudsman, after all Amnesty International reviews collected should draw conclusions and realize that it is not possible to put between the victim and the aggressor.

"Therefore, I urge them and other organizations that work in Ukraine to cover confirmed facts, relevant and proven information, and not be subjected to native provocations and information narratives!After all, it is about the reputation of the ID. The question is rhetorical, "he said.

Lubinets also assured that the Commissioner's Office is always open and ready to provide proven and confirmed information that he owns, and to speak only the truth about Ukraine.As reported by Ukrinform, in August 2022, Amnesty International was criticized not only by representatives of the Ukrainian authorities, but also by international experts after the report that the Ukrainian military did not cause "harm to peaceful inhabitants", based on the inhabitants.

Russian propaganda immediately used this report for accusations to the address.

Amnesty International, criticism has indicated that the study of wartime ignore and morally puts a sign of equality between the aggressor.

Many developing countries are looking for reliable sources of funding. The One Belt, One Way Initiative looks like a good and cheap offer. But many countries in the global south already have poor experience in relations with China, as Chinese loans have led to a debt crisis.

We also focus on the production of added cost for our partner countries. Because they want to move to the location of the relevant chain, to produce final products, or semi -finished products.

The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive compensation mechanism that will ensure a real payment of compensation, ”the Wise said.

According to her, in addition to the register of losses, such a mechanism of compensation will be damaged by the compensation commission, which will directly consider the claims and notify the compensation and the compensation fund that will accumulate the payment of compensation.

“Therefore, at the same time as the process of starting the register of losses, active work continues to create the two other components of a special compensation mechanism - the Compensation Commission and the Compensation Fund. In particular, it is the burial and search of legal structures that will be the basis of the international agreement, on the basis of which a special compensation mechanism will be based. In spite of all the evil and grief that the aggressor brought, it must be held accountable in strict responsibility to the requirements of international law. Effective implementation of the comprehensive compensation mechanism is the key to achieving justice for all, who suffered from Russia's illegal actions against Ukraine, ”she explained.

The Wise also noted that the International Register of Damage was created under the auspices of the Council of Ukraine and is based on an extended partial agreement on the register of losses, caused by the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and will function on the basis on the register of losses caused by aggression of the Russian Federation.Moreover, on February 17 this year, the Government of the Netherlands officially agreed on the proposal of Ukraine to create an international organization - a register of losses caused to Ukraine by Russian aggression. Accordingly, the register of the register was fixed that the location of the register is the Hague, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, ”the Wise said.

She also said that the status and functioning of the Register in the King Station will be governed by the agreement between the host state and the Council of Europe.

“The register has the status of a legal entity in accordance with the national legislation of the Netherlands and Ukraine, and thus will be able to complete the task. So, this means the presence of an Iophys, both staff, and proper infrastructure. In addition, the Statute has already determined the structure of governing bodies and supervision of the activities of the registers. After the creation of a register is legally enshrined, the miracles were actively drawn up - solving the same practical issues as necessary for its practical launch, ”the Wise said.

According to her, the register will also have an auxiliary office in Ukraine to go to the Government of Ukraine and facilitate the dissemination of information with potential applicants and the public in Ukraine as a whole, in particular, regarding the existence and purpose of the Register and Procedure for Submission of Damage.

“The register will accept and process information about the notes of damages, information confirming such losses provided to individuals, legal entities, as well as the state of Ukraine. All data will be categorized with trimatized, and they will be assessed for the suitability of the claim in the registry for the purpose of their future consideration and the decision on compensation. The register will have no functions for consideration of such applications, including the definition of liability and award of any payments of chipcompensation, ”she explained.

In particular, the criteria of acceptability for entering applications in the Register for the purpose of their proceedings and decisions will be defined in the rules of the registry. At the same time, the basic condition for making statements of the prerequishars is that they should be supplied with respect to losses, damage or damage caused: from February 24, 2022, in Ukraine in its international recognized borders, emerged through international Unlawful acts of the Russian Federation in Ukraine or against Ukraine.** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-vidbudova/3711525-kraini-g7-primusat-rosiu-zaplatiti-za-pislavoenne-vidnovlenna-ukraini.html)As reported by Ukrinform, at the Council of Europe Summit in Reykjavik more than 40 IEC countries [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3710382-na-samiti-radi-evropi-stvorili-reestr-zbitkiv-ukraini-vid-agresii-rf.html)On the creation of registries caused by Ukraine by aggression of the Russian Federation.

He has been reacting to the words of a spokesman for the Polish foreign policy department in [](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid021cD7Amt9C3RuCss2KqBXarKUHr68sX9K6Tn1nEYmeMcUX2gkNRiozUFuQU48HoGrl&id=100004136855199), reports Ukrinform.

“Any attempts to impose on the President of Ukraine or Ukraine what we must do about our common past are unacceptable and covered. We are commemorating the history, ready for dialogue and mutual understanding, and at the same time we call for respect and prudence in the statements, especially in the complex reality of the Genocidal Russian aggression against the Ukrainian people, ”Zvarych said.

He added that in fact the famous formula of true reconciliation in Ukrainian-Polish relations, which was taken as the basis of the hierarchs of churches of both countries, understanding the raining of history and the whole moral-Christian essence of the Ukrainian-Polish-Wimp, sounds like: "We forgive and ask for forgiveness."

In an interview with ONet.pl Yasin noted that on the Ukrainian side there is still a "little understanding" how important this topic is for Poles. He noted that there may have been a little understanding of this topic by President Zelensky.

When asked if Zelensky should apologize for the Volyn crime, it is a clear that "the Ukrainian state did not do so, but the President of Zelensky from Ukraine should take more responsibility." He noted that the formulation should sound like: "I apologize and ask, we apologize."

He added that the information that Ukrainian intelligence was also played in this.

According to him, the Russians needed to create a picture of a massive offensive and the gifting:

- And to create a picture of these columns. So it was. No one was up to fight as in Mariupol. There were no options.
