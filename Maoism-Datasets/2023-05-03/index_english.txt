 The Coordination Headquarters met with the families of prisoners of orchestrants of the36th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade named after Mikhail Bilynsky.
Representatives of the coordination headquarters, the National Police, the Security Service of Ukraine and the Office of the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rights Council answered the questions.
About it reports Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.
“They discussed the health of our defenders and defenders in captivity. Many people have been in captivity for more than a year without proper medical care. Ukraine is doing everything to return them home and make the aggressor country guarantee the necessary condition. But this, unfortunately, depends not only on Ukraine, ”the presentation says.
It is noted that the headquarters representative said that during evacuation with the Mariupolia, the International Committee of the Red Cross surveyed our defenders, but Russia has not confirmed many of the officials. However, for the ICRC International Community, it is evidence of our people's enslavement and violation of the agreements on their release.
The relatives were also interested in whether it was possible to re-select DNA.
Also, with the representative of the Office of the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Human Rights, they were naming how to raise the problem of torture at the international level and the improper conditions of keeping our prisoners in Russia.

 Prosecutors in court proved that a resident of the Saltov district of Kharkiv, one of the most affected areas from the shelling of the Russian military, corrected enemy fire.
About it reports Office of the Prosecutor General.
“In June 2022, in one of the social networks, a man in his own comments showed the exact positions of the AFU air defense forces in Kharkiv. After the man published forbidden information, the Russian military has exposed these locations for five times. At the hearing, Kharkiv residents explained that he really wrote comments on the social network, but did not recognize the prime. The convicted in this way allegedly tried to prevent the proves, ”the message reads.

 - The first creation of our Sirko UAV enterprise is a tactical reconnaissance type with a fixed wing. He can collect reconnaissance information, providing a permanent video with the operator at a distance of up to 30 kilometers, the Vafline mode-up to 50 km,-says Skyssist, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Skyssist Scientific and Production Company LLC.
 According to manufacturers, SIRKO UAVs are made of cast housing, that is, this feature allows to organize the process of assembling the apparatus on the conveyor to provide its mass production.
Sirko has a size of 93 centimeters in wings, it is considered super -light because it will only lead 1.37 kilograms. The battery charge is enough to overcome the distance to 130-140 kilometers at an altitude of about 1 thousand meters. In the air, this fabric is up to one and a half hours depending on the weather - for example, the spinning wind is decreasing.

 Four 4K cameras are installed on the UAV. With a sustainable connection, the drone proves the video on board the operator in an online mode.

According to the designers, the aircraft itself is made of polymer material, which is completely radio transparent - in the mode of radio silence the means of electronic struggle of the enemy is not seen or perceived as a bird.
It distinguishes Sirko from the rest of the famous UAV brands and the fact that its operators can get it from shelter, for example, a dugout, placing the antenna and the mast from the human location.
 - For example, known to all UAV MAVIC is only manually controlled. And its pultication emit radio waves, which the enemy can fix. That is, the safety assembly to stay on the terrain can be a very short time, the UAV flight will also be short -lived. The structure of our complex extends the work of the operator, and can save his life in the event that the rebuper records the work of the station and opens the fire in its direction, - explains Krynichko.
According to manufacturers, you can master the control of SIRKO UAV for two to three weeks. The school of operators is directly in production.
According to Igor Krynichko, the enterprise is currently at the stage of signature of the state agreement for the supply of these complexes, in particular the change in defense.
In addition, the SIRKO UAV developers announced the presentation of his youngest brother - a new shock drone of Ukrainian production.

Yesterday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine amended the legislation and gave the right to impose martial law or declare a state of war or the actual war at the beginning of the next military rank ahead of time.
Earlier, according to our legislation, the military leadership could encourage the subordinate personnel by early assignment of the next military conduct only once during the entire time of military service.
The developers of the bill in their explanatory record They substantiated the need to amend Article 29 of the Disciplinary Status as follows: “… Given the situation in Ukraine in connection with the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, there is a need to provide opportunities to encourage servicemen through early assignment of the regular military.”
According to the People's Deputies, such changes will "stimulate Ukrainian defenserants to improve their special training, organizing skills in the difficult conditions of modern combat."
Applying this type of encouragement, the military leadership will be able to "assign the army rank for the second time, but not earlier than six months after the previous military rank."
So, from the lieutenant to the captain, from the senior lieutenant to the major ... However, such a rapid career growth will be able to count those defenders and defenders of our country who will be under the bullets from the rashist aggressor.
The law for which 265 deputies voted will enter into force after it is signed by the President of Ukraine and promulgation.
Earlier the Armyinform wrote that in March the Verkhovna Rada approved the Lalazaconovoprekt, which was allowed by the military to receive officer rank of Bez -military education.

 Russian-Ukrainian war, started in 2014 is an example of hybrid warfare, whereinformation is the same weapon as bullet on the battlefield. The correct useof terms plays a very important role in explaining for the global audiencewhat is happening in Ukraine now – the Russian occupiers are committinggenocide against the Ukrainian nation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine prepared the glossary on Russianaggression against Ukraine. It could be useful for foreign media, think tanksand governments. For a long period of time, state aggressor, the RussianFederation and before Russian empire and Soviet Union promoted the narrativesabout Ukraine as a failed state, Ukrainian as artificial language and thesisabout Russians and Ukrainians as the one nation. Therefore, we have to explainforeigners how to use terms correctly.
We bring to your attention the glossary «Correct terminology on Russianaggression against Ukraine»:
Correct Terminology on Russian Aggression Against Ukraine:Ukraine has never conducted any military and biological activities, includingits own territory. Ukraine has never developed biological weapons and does nothave any specialized facilities for this purpose.
Such facilities had only existed on the territory of the former USSR withinthe borders of the Russian Federation which inherited the correspondinginfrastructure and facilities.
All medical and biological facilities of Ukraine are used for peacefulpurposes only to strengthen its own biosecurity.
Russia may spread fake narratives about so called “military and biologicalactivities in Ukraine” to cover up its a false flag biological incident. | Russians are out of politics / alienated from politics / cannot influencepolitics | Russians profess political indifference/apathy and thus maintainimplicit consent with Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine, Syria, Chechnya, Africanstates etc. | Ordinary Russians are not responsible for Russia’s crimes | Every Russian isresponsible for Russia’s crimes in Ukraine as long as they support Putin’sregime and its actions. | The Russian Public Opinion Research Center publisheddata that at least 68% of Russians support the actions of the Russian regime.The poll was conducted during January 2023.

Peace talks without withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukrainewill lead to conservation of the temporarily occupation of Ukrainianterritories by Russia and will be used by Russia for new attack later.Any peace initiative should be based on the above-mentioned Resolution.

The deputy chief of the Main Directorate of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Vadim Skibitsky, told about the moods and preparation of the Russians for the defense of the occupied Crimea and Mariupol during the interview.
About it reports The main management of IOU intelligence.
According to him, in the territory of Mariupol, Russian invaders are preparing house defense and actively restore the necessary for combat action, including port.
Meanwhile, in the Crimea, the Ukrainian movement is strengthened. His activity, together with blows to the Crimean military objects, sets a depressing impression on the Russians.
“We see that the Russians are afraid. The same base in Sevastopol and other military objects are now strongly guarded, the occupiers have positions to protect from any attacks against this infrastructure, ”GUR said.
According to Skibitsky, now the enemy has moved most of the warships of Zevastopol into the territory of the Russian Federation, in particular to Novorossiysk, to avoid their destruction in the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea.
Also, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence noted that by the fall of 2022 Russian invaders did not pay much attention to the defense of Crimea.
However, after the success of the Ukrainian army in Kharkiv, Kherson region, and then - the strikes of military sites and the actions of our movement of resistance in the territory of the occupied half forced the invaders to "take the head": to erect fortifications, to strengthen the coasts, and so on.
According to Major General Skybitsky, the liberation of Crimea will depend on the number of medicines:
“It will all depend on how our release operation will be planned. Second, what will be the moral state of Russian servicemen. If they are panic and everyone starts running away, then a "goodwill gesture" is possible. But this will be very simple, because they consider Crimea to be the last fortress and will go to defend the peninsula to the end, ”Vadim Skibitsky emphasized.

"In this way, the occupiers deliberately provoke an increase in the number of cases of conflict in public, which grow into a cruel beating of citizens of disagreements with the Russian occupation regime," Anna Malyta said. "It is noticeable that the so -called investigative bodies in investigating conflict situations make decisions solely in favor of pro -Russian providers."
Thus, according to Anna Malyar, the majority of mass fights in the settlement of Kherson region, which resulted in citizens received significant bodily harm, "investigators" were classified as not having a crime, Avin's Russian provocateurs cannot be brought to criminal responsibility.
"The Russian Federation always uses criminality for political purposes. In 2014-2015, they brought to us their" thieves in the law "to disconnect and destabilize the situation.
What is this for? In an unstable internal environment, the Russians to make their criminal intentions.

 Ukraine is not engaged in attacks on Russia or its president, but protects its low -void and territorial integrity. About it stated President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during communication with media representatives according to the results of the Ukrainian - North Summit in Helsinki.
Answering the journalist's question about the recent span of the UAP over the Kremlin UMSKVA, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "We do not attack neither Putin nor Moscow. We are fighting in our own territory, we protect our villages and cities."
The head of state added that Ukraine is experiencing a shortage of weapons to ensure its defense, so the Ukrainian army does not use it anywhere except the battlefield.
“We can't use anything and anywhere. That is why we did not attack Putin. We will leave it the tribunal, ”he stated.
Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his belief that the Russian leader accuses Ukraine of this alleged attack and attempting to attempt him because Russia has no victories in the battlefield in the war in Ukraine. Therefore, the Russian steering is used to justify the continuation of aggression.
“He can no longer motivate his society and simply send the tolerance of the military. He can no longer motivate his state. He has no winning on the battlefield. The second army of the world lost. They are incapable of occupying Ukraine. They have repelled from us. Now he needs to somehow motivate these people to go forward, ”the head of the Ukrainian state said.
"They lost this war - they lost as a state, lost historically ... Here is a thing. And now he needs to do something sharp - the attempts, the drones, then we had some geese that bombed them ... That is, they will invent every day or other steps, ”Vladimir Zelensky added.
At the same time, the President noted that instead of inventing another provocation, the Russian authorities can simply withdraw troops from the Ukrainian territory and therefore overcome the difficult situation for themselves.
“No one has to intimidate, you do not need to use the weapon - you need to get out of the territory. Absolutely everyone, even the states of NATO or outside the European Union of rifled continents - all recognize the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Therefore, it would be a solution. It is much easier than the use of various information or any manipulation, ”the head of the state emphasized.“We are not looking for Russia's interests, we are looking for an agreement to be famous. With regard to the grain initiative, we have a clear arrangement of Isantonia Guterrice, the Secretary General of the UN, and with the President of Turkey Ardogan. Our arrangements are ongoing. We plan to continue our initiative. For their part, we have a conversation with the Russian side, they must prepare with them the continuation of this corridor, which is so needed by other countries of the world. So many of us, ”the President of Ukraine summarized.
