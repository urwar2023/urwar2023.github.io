![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/golovna-5.jpg)- The first creation of our Sirko UAV enterprise is a tactical reconnaissance type with a fixed wing. He can collect reconnaissance information, providing a permanent video with the operator at a distance of up to 30 kilometers, the Vafline mode-up to 50 km,-says Skyssist, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Skyssist Scientific and Production Company LLC.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/1-12.jpg)According to manufacturers, SIRKO UAVs are made of cast housing, that is, this feature allows to organize the process of assembling the apparatus on the conveyor to provide its mass production.

- We can collect up to 1 thousand UAVs a month. At the same time, with proper financing, we can scale our production facilities, as the stamping technology allows you to make about 200 sides a day. The cost of a non -station without a station is $ 3,000. With the ground station, depending on the completion - up to $ 9,000, - says Krynichko.

Sirko has a size of 93 centimeters in wings, it is considered super -light because it will only lead 1.37 kilograms. The battery charge is enough to overcome the distance to 130-140 kilometers at an altitude of about 1 thousand meters. In the air, this fabric is up to one and a half hours depending on the weather - for example, the spinning wind is decreasing.

- That is, the operator can instantly make a decision on further actions on line Front or transmits information to the relevant units, - the head of the Supervisory Board shares the subtlets of the drone.

[!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/5-4-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-4.jpg)

According to the designers, the aircraft itself is made of polymer material, which is completely radio transparent - in the mode of radio silence the means of electronic struggle of the enemy is not seen or perceived as a bird.

It distinguishes Sirko from the rest of the famous UAV brands and the fact that its operators can get it from shelter, for example, a dugout, placing the antenna and the mast from the human location.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/7-4-e1683092945140.jpg)- For example, known to all UAV MAVIC is only manually controlled. And its pultication emit radio waves, which the enemy can fix. That is, the safety assembly to stay on the terrain can be a very short time, the UAV flight will also be short -lived. The structure of our complex extends the work of the operator, and can save his life in the event that the rebuper records the work of the station and opens the fire in its direction, - explains Krynichko.

According to manufacturers, you can master the control of SIRKO UAV for two to three weeks. The school of operators is directly in production.

According to Igor Krynichko, the enterprise is currently at the stage of signature of the state agreement for the supply of these complexes, in particular the change in defense.

In addition, the SIRKO UAV developers announced the presentation of his youngest brother - a new shock drone of Ukrainian production.

“The distillery that are actually unprofitable and sometimes preserved in the last ten, and are now very demand for them. We see that the main demand creates agrarian.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-03T-31-17-38-03-00/630_360_1652785404-401.jpg)Ukraine is expanding the range of partners and developing relations with Israel.

Olena Kondratyuk, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, said this in the Eviritelvagraphon "The One News", commenting on a meeting with the Israeli Parliamentary Delegation, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“European countries are in close contact with Ukraine, and during the full -scale war, we were not a single visit at different levels. We have such guns with our partners from the United States and Great Britain. But with Israel there were other things, no Ukrainian delegation was flooded by Israel during this time. On the part of Israel recently we had the first visit of foreign minister, ”Kondratyuk said.

"The voice of Israel is very important to us in the UN, where we want to consider the resolution we will prepare about the deportation and forced export of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation," Kondratyuk stressed.

According to VisesPicker, Israel has its position on Ukraine and does not plan to supplement to Kiev weapons, but "that does not mean that we should not build a dialogue."

As it was reported, the parliamentary Ukrainian delegation headed by the deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada Elena Kondratyuk is in Israel. In particular, she meeting with colleagues from the Parliamentary Friendship Group Ukraine-Israel.

This belief expressed in an interview [](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/podcasts/how-to-avoid-great-power-war-mark-milley)The chairman of the Joint Committee of US Headquarters, General Mark Millie, Ukrinform reports.

“I think their capabilities(Ukrainian forces - ed.)They increased significantly, ”the American general said.

He said that now the Armed Forces are quite capable of attacking. "They can carry out tight operations and can be defended - much better than that they had only a year ago," Millie said.

At the same time, the General did not comment on the Armed Forces readiness for counter -offensive operation.

“This is solved by them, they carry out a considerable amount of planning and coordination, and they have everything to do so if they are done by the offensive operation. But they are ready for attack or defense, ” - emphasized the American commander.

" However, in words, the Russians suffered enormous losses - and not only on the battlefield, their economy has caused significant damage.

"I think that rational people - within the framework of the decision -making process in Russia - will be concluded, I think, during months or year or two, they have argued that the price exceeds the benefit," Millie said.

Then, in his opinion, the Russians will come to the need to participate in the intervals. “Maybe this moment has not come - I cannot read thoughts. I do not know when Putin is ready to do it, but at some point, if he thinks rationally, he will need to do it, ”the general explained.

At the same time, Milli emphasized that Putin could take such a step today if he wanted, of course, he has internal political restrictions.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-03T18-44-00-03-00/630_360_1659440274-479.jpg)The main risks that can hypothetically pose a threat to freedom of speech in Ukraine are theoretical loss of territories, economic problems and restructuring space.

This was stated by the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy Nikita Potraev during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.

The parliamentarian reminded that [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3703919-ukraina-pidnalasa-na-79-shodinku-v-indeksi-svobodi-zmi-rsf.html). According to him, the Ukrainian authorities have secured the right to freedom in a full -scale invasion, in particular, there is no military censorship: "Myia was not introduced in any way, in any percentage."

If we talk about the risks that could hypothetically threaten freedom to speak to Ukraine, the first of them, according to Poturayev, is a military loss, a loss. "We understand that there is no freedom in the occupied territories, there is no safety for [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zurnalist)both professional and civic, ”he said.

The second risk, according to the deputy, is economic problems. Despite the difficult economic situation, the Ukrainian media passes this period, but "the further deterioration of the economic situation is undoubtedly a risk, because ... the media must earn," he said.

“We are constantly in conversations with international partners, we raise the issue of a failing increase in targeted assistance in support of Ukrainian media and journalists. We believe that now, unfortunately, this help is not sufficient, ”Potrayev emphasized.

“This is due to objective reasons. The role of Ukrainian YouTube is growing, so there are many of our citizens abroad of Ukraine.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-03T22-17-38-03-00/630_360_1652785404-401.jpg)Ukraine is expanding the range of partners and developing relations with Israel.

Olena Kondratyuk, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, said this in the Eviritelvagraphon "The One News", commenting on a meeting with the Israeli Parliamentary Delegation, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“European countries are in close contact with Ukraine, and during the full -scale war, we were not a single visit at different levels. We have such guns with our partners from the United States and Great Britain. But with Israel there were other things, no Ukrainian delegation was flooded by Israel during this time. On the part of Israel recently we had the first visit of foreign minister, ”Kondratyuk said.

"The voice of Israel is very important to us in the UN, where we want to consider the resolution we will prepare about the deportation and forced export of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation," Kondratyuk stressed.

According to VisesPicker, Israel has its position on Ukraine and does not plan to supplement to Kiev weapons, but "that does not mean that we should not build a dialogue."

As it was reported, the parliamentary Ukrainian delegation headed by the deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada Elena Kondratyuk is in Israel. In particular, she meeting with colleagues from the Parliamentary Friendship Group Ukraine-Israel.

The deputy head of the Presidential Office of Ukraine Rostislav Shurma said the Televahorfon Welvaraphone "The One News", Ukrinform reports.

“The distillery that are actually unprofitable and sometimes preserved in the last ten, and are now very demand for them. We see that the main demand creates agrarian.

Thus, last month the main thesis is "only the victory over Nazism in Ukraine can allow Russia to guarantee safety, restore stability in the EU." The outfit with this was other theses and narratives that the Russians tried to spill in the first on -the -other target audience, which does not quite like to check the information that Russian propagandists are served on the "sauce". In particular:

* "NATO Secretary General's visit to Kiev testifies to the intention of the North Atlantic Alliance to continue the process of integration of Ukraine into the Western world, which indicates the correctness of the decision on the beginning of" its "; * "Kyiv's criminal acts confirm the need to continue" its "to fulfill all its tasks"; * "Ukraine has permanently lost territories that have previously been defined"; * "Visit of the President of the Russian Federation to the" LNR "of Kherson region - demonstration of confidence of the Russian Federation in their actions"; * "The Kremlin pays special attention to servicemen who perform their tasks, giving them guarantees and social support";

In addition, in order to end the fighting and the desire of the occupiers to win the time of regrouping their troops, the Russian side spread the following narratives:

* "The need to create conditions for negotiations; * "West countries cannot be intermediaries in the negotiation process"; * "Morning plan of the PRC as a new alternative to solving the crisis issue in Ukraine"; * "Collective event is leading a war against Russia"; * "The Western Attempted Try to Isola Reds from Foreign Policy"

Despite the tones of fakes and misinformation, which Russian propaganda spreads vinternette, the National Resistance Center urges Ukrainians to read exclusively verified and official sources.

Yesterday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine amended the legislation and gave the right to impose martial law or declare a state of war or the actual war at the beginning of the next military rank ahead of time.

Earlier, according to our legislation, the military leadership could encourage the subordinate personnel by early assignment of the next military conduct only once during the entire time of military service.

The developers of the bill in their [explanatory record](https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/pubFile/1514995)They substantiated the need to amend Article 29 of the Disciplinary Status as follows: “… Given the situation in Ukraine in connection with the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, there is a need to provide opportunities to encourage servicemen through early assignment of the regular military.”

According to the People's Deputies, such changes will "stimulate Ukrainian defenserants to improve their special training, organizing skills in the difficult conditions of modern combat."

Applying this type of encouragement, the military leadership will be able to "assign the army rank for the second time, but not earlier than six months after the previous military rank."

So, from the lieutenant to the captain, from the senior lieutenant to the major ... However, such a rapid career growth will be able to count those defenders and defenders of our country who will be under the bullets from the rashist aggressor.

The law for which 265 deputies voted will enter into force after it is signed by the President of Ukraine and promulgation.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-03T55-00-00-04-00/ff6ac1c-mzs2.jpg)Russian-Ukrainian war, started in 2014 is an example of hybrid warfare, whereinformation is the same weapon as bullet on the battlefield. The correct useof terms plays a very important role in explaining for the global audiencewhat is happening in Ukraine now – the Russian occupiers are committinggenocide against the Ukrainian nation.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine prepared the glossary on Russianaggression against Ukraine. It could be useful for foreign media, think tanksand governments. For a long period of time, state aggressor, the RussianFederation and before Russian empire and Soviet Union promoted the narrativesabout Ukraine as a failed state, Ukrainian as artificial language and thesisabout Russians and Ukrainians as the one nation. Therefore, we have to explainforeigners how to use terms correctly.

We bring to your attention the glossary «Correct terminology on Russianaggression against Ukraine»:

Correct Terminology on Russian Aggression Against Ukraine:Ukraine has never conducted any military and biological activities, includingits own territory. Ukraine has never developed biological weapons and does nothave any specialized facilities for this purpose.

Such facilities had only existed on the territory of the former USSR withinthe borders of the Russian Federation which inherited the correspondinginfrastructure and facilities.

All medical and biological facilities of Ukraine are used for peacefulpurposes only to strengthen its own biosecurity.

Russia may spread fake narratives about so called “military and biologicalactivities in Ukraine” to cover up its a false flag biological incident. |  Russians are out of politics / alienated from politics / cannot influencepolitics | Russians profess political indifference/apathy and thus maintainimplicit consent with Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine, Syria, Chechnya, Africanstates etc. |  Ordinary Russians are not responsible for Russia’s crimes | Every Russian isresponsible for Russia’s crimes in Ukraine as long as they support Putin’sregime and its actions. | The Russian Public Opinion Research Center publisheddata that at least 68% of Russians support the actions of the Russian regime.The poll was conducted during January 2023.

Peace talks without withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukrainewill lead to conservation of the temporarily occupation of Ukrainianterritories by Russia and will be used by Russia for new attack later.Any peace initiative should be based on the above-mentioned Resolution.

The deputy chief of the Main Directorate of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Vadim Skibitsky, told about the moods and preparation of the Russians for the defense of the occupied Crimea and Mariupol during the interview.

About it [reports](https://gur.gov.ua/content/v-okupovanomu-krymu-rosiiany-boiatsia-vsoho-i-droniv-i-partyzaniv-i-raket-vadym-skibitskyi.html)The main management of IOU intelligence.

According to him, in the territory of Mariupol, Russian invaders are preparing house defense and actively restore the necessary for combat action, including port.

Meanwhile, in the Crimea, the Ukrainian movement is strengthened. His activity, together with blows to the Crimean military objects, sets a depressing impression on the Russians.

“We see that the Russians are afraid. The same base in Sevastopol and other military objects are now strongly guarded, the occupiers have positions to protect from any attacks against this infrastructure, ”GUR said.

According to Skibitsky, now the enemy has moved most of the warships of Zevastopol into the territory of the Russian Federation, in particular to Novorossiysk, to avoid their destruction in the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea.

Also, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence noted that by the fall of 2022 Russian invaders did not pay much attention to the defense of Crimea.

However, after the success of the Ukrainian army in Kharkiv, Kherson region, and then - the strikes of military sites and the actions of our movement of resistance in the territory of the occupied half forced the invaders to "take the head": to erect fortifications, to strengthen the coasts, and so on.

According to Major General Skybitsky, the liberation of Crimea will depend on the number of medicines:

“It will all depend on how our release operation will be planned. Second, what will be the moral state of Russian servicemen. If they are panic and everyone starts running away, then a "goodwill gesture" is possible. But this will be very simple, because they consider Crimea to be the last fortress and will go to defend the peninsula to the end, ”Vadim Skibitsky emphasized.

In order to keep society in fear, the Russian occupation authorities intensify the criminogenic situation in temporarily occupied territories. For this purpose, specially prepared groups of pipelines are used, which are formed mostly of persons who have a criminal past.

About it [stated](https://t.me/annamaliar/692)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.

"In this way, the occupiers deliberately provoke an increase in the number of cases of conflict in public, which grow into a cruel beating of citizens of disagreements with the Russian occupation regime," Anna Malyta said. "It is noticeable that the so -called investigative bodies in investigating conflict situations make decisions solely in favor of pro -Russian providers."

Thus, according to Anna Malyar, the majority of mass fights in the settlement of Kherson region, which resulted in citizens received significant bodily harm, "investigators" were classified as not having a crime, Avin's Russian provocateurs cannot be brought to criminal responsibility.

"The Russian Federation always uses criminality for political purposes. In 2014-2015, they brought to us their" thieves in the law "to disconnect and destabilize the situation.

What is this for? In an unstable internal environment, the Russians to make their criminal intentions.

So, if they bring their criminals to temporarily occupied territories, then they are not so easy to do. We have to loosen and intimidate for the "Russian measure", the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine sums up.

They could not capture the whole of Ukraine, and now they are trying to move in parts, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine. - Donetsk and Lugansk region is their first goal. That is, all the forces are thrown east, where they try to make four directions. And we see that they are very fast, literally, change their tactics depending on our reaction.

For example, Anna Malyar brought the situation in the estuary, where the enemy is on the offensive, then, having received a powerful repel, begins to regroup, something there to bring and organize the offensive again.At the same time, she stressed that Marinka is also one of the epicenter of the confrontation.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-03T96-00-00-04-00/prpplo.jpeg)Ukraine is not engaged in attacks on Russia or its president, but protects its low -void and territorial integrity. About it [stated](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/volodimir-zelenskij-mi-ne-atakuyemo-ani-putina-ani-moskvu-mi-82633)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during communication with media representatives according to the results of the Ukrainian - North Summit in Helsinki.

Answering the journalist's question about the recent span of the UAP over the Kremlin UMSKVA, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "We do not attack neither Putin nor Moscow. We are fighting in our own territory, we protect our villages and cities."

The head of state added that Ukraine is experiencing a shortage of weapons to ensure its defense, so the Ukrainian army does not use it anywhere except the battlefield.

“We can't use anything and anywhere. That is why we did not attack Putin. We will leave it the tribunal, ”he stated.

Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his belief that the Russian leader accuses Ukraine of this alleged attack and attempting to attempt him because Russia has no victories in the battlefield in the war in Ukraine. Therefore, the Russian steering is used to justify the continuation of aggression.

“He can no longer motivate his society and simply send the tolerance of the military. He can no longer motivate his state. He has no winning on the battlefield. The second army of the world lost. They are incapable of occupying Ukraine. They have repelled from us. Now he needs to somehow motivate these people to go forward, ”the head of the Ukrainian state said.

"They lost this war - they lost as a state, lost historically ... Here is a thing. And now he needs to do something sharp - the attempts, the drones, then we had some geese that bombed them ... That is, they will invent every day or other steps, ”Vladimir Zelensky added.

At the same time, the President noted that instead of inventing another provocation, the Russian authorities can simply withdraw troops from the Ukrainian territory and therefore overcome the difficult situation for themselves.

“No one has to intimidate, you do not need to use the weapon - you need to get out of the territory. Absolutely everyone, even the states of NATO or outside the European Union of rifled continents - all recognize the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Therefore, it would be a solution. It is much easier than the use of various information or any manipulation, ”the head of the state emphasized.“We are not looking for Russia's interests, we are looking for an agreement to be famous. With regard to the grain initiative, we have a clear arrangement of Isantonia Guterrice, the Secretary General of the UN, and with the President of Turkey Ardogan. Our arrangements are ongoing. We plan to continue our initiative. For their part, we have a conversation with the Russian side, they must prepare with them the continuation of this corridor, which is so needed by other countries of the world. So many of us, ”the President of Ukraine summarized.
