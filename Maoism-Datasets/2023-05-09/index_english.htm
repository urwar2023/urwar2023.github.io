<p>The Second World War of 1939-1945 became the largest tragedy of the world in the twentieth century. Having taken tens of millions of lives, breaking the fate of hundreds of millions of people, destroying the entire cities and even Ukraine, she paved her bloody path as well as Ukraine.</p>
<p>The front twice swept the lands of Ukraine - first from west to east, then splits to the west. Millions of Ukrainians have laid their lives for the sake of victory over the Nazma Reconstruction of Peace. Millions have undergone wanderings during and after the end of Vivna, which has been signed over the following decades and has been tangible to now.</p>
<p>The broken fates of those who were in camps or in the forced emigration of the war, the explosions of ammunition, which have been hiding in the ground since the war, have crippled and killed in peacetime, serious illnesses and severe burden of the sums of the dead to today do not let people go to the world.</p>
<p>The Second World War became the largest tragedy of humanity in the twentieth century. To remember it, because the war should not be repeated.</p>
<p>Never again!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now this slogan did not work.</p>
<p>Again. Again.</p>
<p>Ukrainian and world "Never again!" did not stop Russian aggressors with their "can repeat".</p>
<p>And the Russians repeat. And Ukrainians stop.</p>
<p>The Russians seek to destroy peace and praise the war.</p>
<p>Ukrainians destroy the war and defend peace.</p>
<p>To stop the Russian "can repeat."</p>
<p>To win the Ukrainian and the world - "Never again!".</p>

<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMiJq9AxmA"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMiJq9AxmA"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>Today we have been able to see: when the state returned an honest history, the topouse of events becomes much sense.</p>
<p>Yesterday, May 8, Europe and the world mentioned the joint victory over aggression, and the surrender of that evil. And today, on May 9, we, along with all the free Europe, celebrating Europe's Day, honoring the achievements, which would be simple if it was not for the victory over Nazism. We would not have such an united Europe - Europe without aggression and revenge, Europe, which respects different culture, which overcomes disputes exclusively in the legal plane and which is proud of the variety on our continent.</p>
<p>The more people know the honest history that they will see more common in interior aggression of the twentieth and 21st centuries, the more they appreciate the sequence. Memorial and Victory Day over Nazism in World War II, and immediately behind it is the Day of Europe, Europe as a dream of a peaceful continent. And this is only a matter of time when we can restore a sustainable Is Right Peace for our part of Europe, for Ukraine. It is only a matter of time when the present aggressor loses how the aggressor that lost 78 years ago, when Russian Rewlets will be crushed by the courage of our soldiers by the taspilic force of the free world.</p>
<p>Today we celebrated Europe in Ukraine with Europe.</p>
<p>The visit of Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission, was Ispolitic on this day, and very productive. We also discussed our defense - what we have to achieve and what we expect from partners. Discussion pressure on Russia, actively preparing with Europe the 11th sanction package against Russia. We discussed our political prospects in European integration. Of course, they also discussed an export dispute with our NSU neighbors. We need to overcome it in a clear spirit of the contractual base available between us.He met today with the communities of European universities - Britain, Sweden, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary and, of course, Ukrainian students. Victory.</p>
<p>There are next good news from partners. From what can be said in public: the Elena Defense Package from the United States. The total volume is 1 billion 200 million donors. Artillery, protection against rockets and drones of terrorists, other things to rein on our defenders and defenders. I thank the President of Biden, Congress - a way of parties - and every American family for its constant support and Za -American force that gives us strength.</p>
<p>We also work with other partners on additional defensive packages - we give new opportunities for our soldiers.</p>
<p>Special gratitude to the France's Parliament for today's decision to recognize the terrorist Russian pseud Private group "Wagner". This is what should be approved by the whole world - every manifestation of terrorism should be destroyed, and every terrorist is convicted.</p>
<p>And, of course, today, after the terrorist state has once again tried to get out of our people and once again lost to our defenders and defenders, I thank our air forces and all our soldiers of other troops who carry out air defense. Indeed!</p>
<p><strong> Glory to all who protect Ukraine and Ukrainians!Thank you all who help!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Thank you all who together with us returns to Europe peace and justice!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the debate in the European Parliament on May 9, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“We will not forget: Russian aggression is a threat. ... This is a threat of tableware in Europe and around the world. ... it is a demonstration of power, power, which is Hope to challenge the law. And we have no right to leave this message, they have nothing to do. An attack on Ukraine is associated with a clear message. Together in NATO, we have to clearly show everyone that we are strong enough to protect ourselves as a peaceful alliance, which does not make the aggression of the other, ”Scholt said.</p>

It is a key to peace on the planet, the politician said.</p>
<p>The German Chancellor acknowledged that against the background of Russian aggression, cohesion and solidarity demonstrated unrecognizable: this concerns assistance to Ukraine, increased the defense capability of the EU itself, as well as the further support of Ukraine by the reconstruction. This task will take a lot of resources, time and patience, the politician said. But, he added, it is also a great chance not only for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe, because "a prosperous, democratic Ukraine is the rejection of Putin's imperial, revisionist, illegal politics on our continent."</p>
<p>Scholt has rejected the criticism of some parliamentarians on the slowness of making Berlin decisions to provide military assistance to Ukraine. Germany is the largest "donor" of Ukraine in the EU, recalled the head of the German government.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, about it in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukr.embassy.Lithuania/posts/pfbid02rcqJ6ivVy3PLxZ5SLHAy3zhxdUJTbqSS2q1XdxdKNndumh2rrPUufh9rhuqtrVfnl"></a>The Embassy of Ukraine in Lithuania reported.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-09T17-09-00-03-00/1683639531-943.jpg" />The event was attended by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Lithuania Petro Beshta together with the Vice -Strubomoboron of Lithuania Sorry Guinas Tomkus. The ceremony of commemoration of the victims of the Second World War was held with the participation of employees of the Embassy of Ukraine in Lithuania, the Ukrainian community, students and teachers of Ukrainian schools in Vilnius, as well as the people and residents of Lithuania.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-09T17-09-00-03-00/1683639530-222.jpg" />“The Ukrainians on the side of the anti -Hitler coalition made a significant contribution to the victory of Nazism. The price of this contribution is extraordinary losses during the 1939-1945 years among Ukrainians and other peoples who lived in the territory of Ukraine. Then eight million people were killed. That is why we know the price of war, ”the question reads.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-09T17-09-00-03-00/1683639530-144.jpg" />The embassy expressed beliefs that the day of memory and reconciliation symbolized the triumph of the winners over the victorious, and the caveat - dictators will always be satisfied with the imperial ambitions in armed, ultimatum, aggression, annexation. The most important result of the war should not be the cult of victory, but the ability to appreciate peace, categorically and uncompromisingly protect it with all the reasonable means.</p>
<p>“Our struggle lasts daily since 2014, and we will certainly defeat, we will be abandoned our native land, protect our right to choose the future freely. For us, this is for freedom, civilization, democracy and European values of anti-imperial ambitions of the insidious aggressive neighbor-Zlochynets, ”the UDIPSPROP was emphasized.</p>

<p>The diplomat noted that negotiations are a very complicated and long process, the passage should not underestimate the homework that Ukraine has to do, in particular, political and legal reforms.</p>
<p>According to Yelchenko, despite understanding from European partners that it is difficult to embody them during the time, no one will cancel these reforms.</p>
<p>“Concerning the negotiations themselves, these are first conclusions <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrokomisia"></a>which she has to provide for each manager - there are many. Then, if some countries have their own exposures, and we see, for example, the latest problems that have arisen between us and Slovakia about the supply of agro -industrial products, they express them, ”said the former post -deputy of Ukraine at the UN.</p>
<p>He noted that these problems should not be diminished, because Ukraine as a large agrarian country with quality products is a natural competitor for such similar countries as Poland, Bulgaria Romania and Slovakia.</p>

That is why it is so much <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tribunal"></a>To supplement the global legal system, "Zelensky said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-09T18-42-00-03-00/1683646849-381.jpeg" />He reported that in a joint group that works for the punishment of the aggressor, there are 37 states. Zelensky expressed his belief that this number would grow. Ukraine is constantly working for a coalition of defenders to be fairly increased.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-09T18-42-00-03-00/1683646850-305.jpeg" />The President recalled that only four states were agreed on the creation of the Nuremberg Tribunal at the beginning of the Second World War, and 24 states were awarded to the coalition for the sake of the tribunal.</p>
<p>"We are now significantly more, and among us are not only European countries. Our community work we prove that the desire for justice is global," Zelensky said.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/vidpovidalnist-agresora-za-zlochin-maye-buti-neminuchoyu-vis-82781"></a>He also noted that this summer, the International Center for Criminal Prosecution of Russian Aggression will begin in Hague this summer, and this will be a practical step in working out materials for the tribunal.</p>
<p>"So we are moving forward, we move step by step," the President said.</p>
<p>According to him, today countries can discuss among themselves what the model of the special tribunal about the crime of Russia's aggression against Ukraine should be to be to be able to carry out the main goal - justice, and can speak about the order of steps that will lead to the launch of the tribunal, because it is normal among civilized countries. But in any case, he stressed, it should be about the tribunal.The President stressed that there is a clear consent between the countries that the correspondence of the aggressor for the crime should be inevitable, and the correspondence of the aggressor for the crime of aggression.</p>
<p>"On May 9, 45 after the day before-May 8-the capitulation of Nazi aggression took place, the world was already actively moving to justice about the aggressor. On May 9 this year, our movement is even more active, even more active, and I want to thank all of you for it!Everyone and everyone who abuses the start of the special joint -of -law on the crime of Russia's aggression anti -Ukraine, "Zelensky said.</p>
<p>According to him, Russia should understand that not only in its military settlements, not only how its leadership evaluated our leadership, our state and economic systems, but also in how it evaluated the attitude of Ukraine and the Western countries to justice.</p>
<p>"Our values for us are real. And we will protect them!And so we make it possible that the main culprit of this aggression and all his accomplices were attracted to everything they have committed -without exception!", "Zelensky said.</p>
<p>Now, according to him, the crime of Russia has already put the 21st century on a icing catastrophe. And this crime calls us to justice, emphasized.</p>
<p>"And our justice must be faster than their despair in their bins, which is obviously obvious," Zelensky said.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, in September 2022, President Vladimir Zelensky has experienced a working group headed by OP Head Andriy Yermak, who processes the creation of a special tribunal to bring the Russian Federation to criminal responsibility for committing the crime of Ukraine. The creation of such a tribunal was supported by the Parliamentary Assembly of Europe, the European Parliament, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and individual states.</p>

<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMiJq9AxmA"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMMiJq9AxmA"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>Today we have been able to see: when the state returned an honest history, the topouse of events becomes much sense.</p>
<p>Yesterday, May 8, Europe and the world mentioned the joint victory over aggression, and the surrender of that evil. And today, on May 9, we, along with all the free Europe, celebrating Europe's Day, honoring the achievements, which would be simple if it was not for the victory over Nazism. We would not have such an united Europe - Europe without aggression and revenge, Europe, which respects different culture, which overcomes disputes exclusively in the legal plane and which is proud of the variety on our continent.</p>
<p>The more people know the honest history that they will see more common in interior aggression of the twentieth and 21st centuries, the more they appreciate the sequence. Memorial and Victory Day over Nazism in World War II, and immediately behind it is the Day of Europe, Europe as a dream of a peaceful continent. And this is only a matter of time when we can restore a sustainable Is Right Peace for our part of Europe, for Ukraine. It is only a matter of time when the present aggressor loses how the aggressor that lost 78 years ago, when Russian Rewlets will be crushed by the courage of our soldiers by the taspilic force of the free world.</p>
<p>Today we celebrated Europe in Ukraine with Europe.</p>
<p>The visit of Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission, was Ispolitic on this day, and very productive. We also discussed our defense - what we have to achieve and what we expect from partners. Discussion pressure on Russia, actively preparing with Europe the 11th sanction package against Russia. We discussed our political prospects in European integration. Of course, they also discussed an export dispute with our NSU neighbors. We need to overcome it in a clear spirit of the contractual base available between us.He met today with the communities of European universities - Britain, Sweden, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary and, of course, Ukrainian students. Victory.</p>
<p>There are next good news from partners. From what can be said in public: the Elena Defense Package from the United States. The total volume is 1 billion 200 million donors. Artillery, protection against rockets and drones of terrorists, other things to rein on our defenders and defenders. I thank the President of Biden, Congress - a way of parties - and every American family for its constant support and Za -American force that gives us strength.</p>
<p>We also work with other partners on additional defensive packages - we give new opportunities for our soldiers.</p>
<p>Special gratitude to the France's Parliament for today's decision to recognize the terrorist Russian pseud Private group "Wagner". This is what should be approved by the whole world - every manifestation of terrorism should be destroyed, and every terrorist is convicted.</p>
<p>And, of course, today, after the terrorist state has once again tried to get out of our people and once again lost to our defenders and defenders, I thank our air forces and all our soldiers of other troops who carry out air defense. Indeed!</p>
<p><strong> Glory to all who protect Ukraine and Ukrainians!Thank you all who help!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Thank you all who together with us returns to Europe peace and justice!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>"Combinations such as 123456, Qwerty, Password and the like are categorically bored, hackers break such passwords in less than a second," the service said.</p>
<p>You should not use your own name, last name, date of birth. The same applies to the names, names and any personal information of relatives.</p>

<p>About the situation in the south of the country in the ether of the Teleterna "Unified News" reported the Press Center of Defense forces of Southern Ukraine of the first rank NataliaGumeniuk.</p>
<p>According to her, many regions of Ukraine felt the enemy rocket attack this night.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what we have warned and focused on it. That this day is likely hostile activity. When tying to those "sacred dates", they do not leave their "connection". It has already been reported that three rockets were shot in the area of our responsibility. For the most part, the enemy aimed at the central part of Ukraine. And we say that the enemy will continue to terrorize and to direct their efforts to keep our population in tension at least today, - said Natalia Humeniuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>She also reminded not to be in danger, to avoid clusters, consciously treat the danger that enemy attacks.</p>
<p>She also added that the enemy used rockets not only by air -breaking rockets, but also by maritime -based missiles, which they have long been preparing for a long time. And their carriers were barked along the Black Sea, hiding there.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were four such rocket carriers. During the night, the enemy has increased their number, adding another. And from one of the surface carriers there were launches of "calibers", which cut the air defense successfully. We just warned this that it is likely that with the help of previous missile attacks the enemy tried to find out how to get around our air defense forces. But they did not succeed, - the spokeswoman for the forces of South of Ukraine said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the 1st rank captain Natalia Humeniuk informed that now 18 units are hostile to the Black Sea. There are five of them. Considering that they made volleys at night. But at least 28 "caliber" rockets, the enemy holds on the enemy. Caliber missiles are high -flowing weapons that occupiers are often used for strokes and critical infrastructure, logistics and more.</p>
<p>Also, she said, the enemy continues to use the missile potential that can still afford. In particular, in addition to the X-101 missiles, they use the X-555, X-22 rockets. And very often use drones.</p>

Communicating with the first Patriot combat services, which have receded the duty, the Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stressed that foreign producers have an equivalent opportunity to test and show how much samples are capable of protecting the state from air aggression, - said Colonel Yuriyignat. - We will ask more to finally replace the old Soviet samples.</p>

<p>OSCE <a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr/542751">made public</a>Report on violations of the rights of Ukrainian children and their compulsory deportation. It is the first separate special international report on the problem of illegal movement of Russian children.</p>
<p><strong> Among the key conclusions of the report is the following: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the beginning of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian children have been moved to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and to the territory of the Russian Federation. This can be qualified as a crime against humanity "deportation or forced movement of the population"; * The evacuation and prolonged movement of Ukrainian children without consent is a violation of international humanitarian law. In some cases - serious violations of the IV Geneva Convention and military crimes; * Forcibly displaced or deported Ukrainian children find themselves in a completely Russian environment. Exposed to a pro -Russian information campaign, which is often reduced to purposeful re -education and involvement in military education; * actions of Russia's change in Ukrainian children, unlawful adoption of children or similar assimilation measures are violations of the IV Geneva Convention; * The Russian Federation creates a variety of obstacles for families who seek to return their children. Impedes the establishment of the list and location of children, which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions; * numerous and repeated violations of the interests and rights of children provided for by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; * The consequences of these numerous violations are of serious concern that the right of displaced Ukrainian children has been violated, in particular: not to be tortured and other inhuman types of treatment or punishment.</li>

<p>Chancellor Scholt has identified three EU lessons.</p>

The prosperous, democratic, European Ukraine is the most clear rejection of the imperial, revisional and illegal policy of Putin. Respect for human rights, international law, freedom and democracy and self -determination. Together, let us defend these principles. We will support Ukraine as long as it is needed, ”the German Chancellor emphasized.</p>
<p>The head of the German government reminded that the EU made a choice in favor of the "Great Evrop" and offered the countries of the Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova, and the survey - and Georgia, the prospect of membership.</p>

<p>The head of state quoted the first sentence of Schuman's declaration, which states that the world in the world cannot be secured without construction efforts, proportional to the dangers that threaten him.</p>
<p>“Now, when we are again opposed to the evil aggression and hatred policy that modern Russia has returned to the continent, when we need victory again, we again turn to the meaning of those words from Schuman's declaration. Our efforts of the united Europe, for the sake of security and peace, should be as exaggerated as Russia's desire is to destroy our security, navigation, our Europe. We have to act in a proportionate threat - not weaker, —This to defeat this evil of aggression so that new generations of Europeans can so self -reproduce the Day of Europe in peace, and not just remember that there was once a Takoeste and that there was peace on the continent, ”the president is convinced.</p>

<p>According to her, the regime of Vladimir Putin has destroyed these values in Russia and is to do the same in Ukraine because it is afraid of a successful example that our state demonstrates on the way to the European Union.</p>
<p>“But the aggressor has already made a huge mistake. Ukraine has withstood this offensive, in particular, because Ukrainian society is free.

" Involuntarily, these words cause a smile - the clubs are inevitable, the victory will be behind Ukraine, and after the reflection of the Navalirashist killer there will be life again ...</p>

<p>About it <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/vidpovidalnist-agresora-za-zlochin-maye-buti-neminuchoyu-vis-82781">reports</a>Office of the President of Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong> Mr. Prosecutor General!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Good afternoon, dear colleagues, I congratulate you all in this format. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Dear Ursulo, Dear Colleagues!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to work today for the sake of justice!</p>
<p>78 years ago, Europe received perhaps the most important chance in its long history - a chance for a permanent and truly long -term peace.</p>
<p>What was the chance?</p>
<p>Not only in the refusal of aggressions, not only in political instruments that united Europe-once at odds-to prevent any new steps on aggression, any new aggression, but also in punishment. Parking for the aggression that brought the greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century - we all understand that it is the Second World War.</p>
<p>The main culprit of that disaster did not reach the tribunal hall. He himself, Zbuhire, made an obvious sentence for himself. But his accomplices, including the key vision of aggression, were punished in the legal plane. This is exactly how people are punished in a civilized way of punishing any criminals: prosecution, litigation, sentence and its implementation. And this served as a strong support of peace - a specific example when violators of peace were punished by the whole world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 68 years after the verdict of the Nuremberg Tribunal, Europe reinforced aggression. She saw that there was a regime that simply does not believe that every world was now able to punish the violators of peace. Russia began in the 14th year of aggression in Ukraine and made it in the 22nd year full-scale, because in the leadership of the movement it prevailed that Europe left the history of historians and everyday and policies of Europe did not dare to really protect their values, unhappy with the new aggression as, As it takes to protect yourself.</p>
<p>We have to prove that the aggressor was wrong in everything!And not only in his military calculations, not only how he evaluated our leadership, our state taeconomic systems. But also in how he evaluated our attitude itself.</p>
<p>Our values for us are real. And we will protect them!And so, we make it possible for the main culprit of this aggression and all his accomplices to be held accountable for everything they have committed - without exception!</p>
<p>This is primarily concerned with the crime of aggression. This crime of Russia has now been entrusted to the border of a global catastrophe. This crime calls us on the right.Our justice should prove international unity in justice, as it was Je Nuremberg. Unfortunately, in the International Criminal Court, whose activity we support, there is no jurisdiction on the crime of aggression. That is why the tribunal is necessary to supplement the global legal system. I am glad to say that in our common group, which works for the punishment of the aggressor - Cenash Sor Group - 37 states. And this number will grow - we will constantly work that our coalition of defenders of justice increases.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that only the state of the state was agreed on the creation of the Nuremberg tribunal. In total, 24 states have been included in the coalition for the sake of the tribunal. It is now significantly more, and not only European countries are not only among us. We argue that the desire for justice is global.</p>
<p>And this summer the International Center for Criminal Prosecution of Russian Aggression will begin work - will begin its work in the Hague. It will be a practical step in the work of materials for the tribunal. So we move forward, we move step by step.</p>
<p>We can discuss among each other what the model of special tribunal in the crime of Russia's aggression against Ukraine should be to achieve the main purpose. We can talk about the order of the steps that will lead the tribunal… We are democratic nations, and speak and agree to us - this is a normal, common thing. But again I emphasize: it should be a tribunal.</p>
<p>I am glad that there is a clear consent between us that the aggressor's responsibility for the crime should be inevitable. And it is the responsibility of the aggressor Zlochin.</p>
<p>On May 9, 45 after the day before-May 8-the capitulation of Nazi aggression took place, the world was already actively moving to justice about the aggressor. On May 9 this year, our movement is even more active, even more number, and I want to thank all of you for it!Thank you to everyone and everyone who will start the start of the special journal on the crime of Russia's aggression anti -Ukraine!</p>
<p>May the chance of our Europe and the world on the sustainable and truly long -lasting peace of aggression will be realized!</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>The questions were answered by the head of the working group on the interaction of ZImia and relatives of the defenders of the coordination staff Andriy Yusov, the head of the department of sub -department and consulting relatives of the defenders Yuriy Taranyuk, representatives of the National Guard, the Azov Brigade, the National Police and the Security Service of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Ukraine raises the issue of a terrorist attack in Olenivka at the highest international level. Defenders and defenders, relatives of those who have left in captivity, diplomats at all sites require investigation of this crime. The defense is evidenced by the torture and the Ministry of Foreign Preschools provides these testimony at the interstate level.</p>
<p>“Russia did not provide access to the terrorist attack. We are not silent. The exit from Mariupol was guaranteed that Russia would adhere to the Geneva Conventions, - said Andrei Yusov. -The aggressor country has broken these guarantees. Unfortunately, the red cross under the supervision of the evacuation has not had levers of water -silage to force it to comply with the arrangements. Investigation of the Russian Rules in Bucha was possible because this city was released. It will be Zelenivka. The International Criminal Court has initiated cases of this crime. However, Ukraine is also investigating. The main thing is that a year ago it was possible to protect the lives of Mariupol defenders. Without waiting for the victory and completion of the fighting, we released 2324 defender from captivity. No country was able to achieve such a result during such a conflict. ”</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross made publications about Olenivka. However, this organization does not have a mandate to condemn any of the parties to the conflict and the privacy policy.</p>
<p>"We have repeatedly tried to access Olenivka after the event of July 292022," said ICCH. - Unfortunately, not everyone and whom they could. They were questioned that people did not disappear. "</p>
<p>They also discussed the prospects for the exchange of "everyone".</p>
<p>“It is a real process, not a story for reassuring. The concept of "all" we and we have different. There will be a great battle around this, ”Andrei Yusov summed up.</p>

<p>We remind that security in Europe and the world are interconnected and can be bomented only if international law is fully observed, which are integral compounds of which are the territorial integrity and political independence of state UN Charters.</p>
<p>We express their deep respect for the courage and endurance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which have become a strong shield for all European nations with the support of the countries of the world. Ukraine pays a high price not only for its future but also for the safety of tamy -to -do others.</p>
<p>We confirm our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine, which is fighting for its independence against the background of Russian aggression.</p>
<p>We support the principles of just and long peace, reflected in the formalimra of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, the need for any peace to fully reflect the UN Charter and the UN General Assembly resolution on February 23, 2023 “the principles of the UN Charter, which underlie the comprehensive, just sustainable peace in Ukraine.

<p>We strongly condemn the illegal, unjustified and unexpected armed aggression that grossly violates the UN Statute, which is confirmed by the ES-11/1 resolution(2022)UN General Assembly, which strongly condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation in the contrary of Ukraine and reminds of resolution 3314(XXIX)December 14, 1974, which sets aggression as the use of armed force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another state or in any other way that contradicts the Statute and which defines an aggressive war against international peace.We emphasize the need to achieve justice, as provided for by the Vbuchansk Declaration for liability for the most difficult crimes of the international law committed in the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, we confirm that the persons responsible for committing a crime against Ukraine should not be unpunished, and urge the international community to consider the relevant, in particular by creating a proper mechanism of justice to ensure the efficient responsibility for aggression, which causes concern.</p>
<p>Therefore, we support the creation of the tribunal to ensure the effective responsibility of aggression against Ukraine.</p>

<p>The head of the Ukrainian state devoted his speech to courage, because it is self -important in all spheres of life: both in the life of man, in the life of the state, and in the life of the European continent.</p>
<p>“We would be here today if 80 years ago the free peoples of the world did not show sufficient courage to destroy the evil of Nazism? Obviously, if there was a deficiency of courage then, today we would not be here, ”Vladimirzelensky said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-09T90-00-00-04-00/028fd47f53bdf67d0cd2c81de6ec81b7_1683648898_wysiwyg.jpeg" />According to him, after the Second World War, the space of freedom in Europe and almost all over the world was steadily expanding, because the courage of people became more. I will not be able to people with one or another right.</p>
<p>"All you can look at the path that your countries have gone in the struggle for people, in the struggle for our Europe, which we know and appreciate, to do it that it was the path of courage - specific bold people who built our community of free peoples", Said the President.</p>
<p>He emphasized that nowadays we have no right to be illusions that the battle of the praise has already been completed and that the courage will never be needed again.</p>
<p>“This brutal terrorist war conducted by Russia against Ukraine is a reminder of our country, everyone and every one of you personally that courage can be needed today as well as at any other time courage was needed to protect freedom and our European values ”, - the head of state emphasizes.</p>
<p>According to Vladimir Zelensky, personal courage grows into the courage of socialities, peoples and states and as a result - into the courage of the continent.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-09T90-00-00-04-00/4d0de89ff74aaabc9974b7f3c76ef2bc_1683648898_wysiwyg.jpeg" />The President expressed his belief that it was thanks to the courage that Ukraine and its union will defeat in this cruel war, which Russia resolved, and overcome the Russian ideology of hatred for European freedom.</p>
<p>“And our victory now, when Russian aggression has touched only Ukraine, will do what has not been done in a decisive decade before the Second War. We will destroy the total evil during its roots, when it was not yet aggressive to reach other peoples in Europe, ”the Head of State said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, even after our victory, it is impossible to lose their mockery.</p>
<p>“You don't have to lose your courage!No one knows the time when you may have to defend freedom. No one knows exactly how much freedom can occur in a year, after five years. If you have to protect freedom, please be bold!Please do not give your values to those who seek to destroy them. Fight to make the space of freedom neutral. If they didn't do so, today we would not be here. If we are not doing so, will freedom be preserved after us? ”, - said the President of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky wished every student and a student to find the sphere, their courage will be able to give more freedom and opportunities to the whole of Europe.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-09T90-00-00-04-00/d7e7e2211f1e8acaa5de92080d5f8ac3_1683648898_wysiwyg.jpeg" />Answering students' questions, Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that nowadays, European values ​​are now in the fight against Russia, so Ukraine can consider Ukraine as a support for a democratic world.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is a wall between absolute autocratia and democracy. And so the foolish stand. In order to be in the future a reliance of powerful tanza land. That is why we keep this wall firmly, ”the President said.</p>
<p>According to the head of state, Europeans also need to realize that citizens, although they were once in the USSR, in essence - Europeans, professes values and, most importantly, protect them today. That is why the EU citizen must continue to support Ukraine and assist in the fight against the Rabbit Aggressor.The President emphasized that the war should end with the withdrawal of Russian troops of the Ukrainian territories and not turn into a frozen conflict of Uevrop.</p>
<p>“We want to displace Russian troops from our territory. We do not want any more than the war. We just want to be free and remind you that not at the President Putin's Presidential Theater, but we are a self -sufficient state, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>He also noted that after the end of the war, Ukraine - the future full EU - will need reconstruction, as many cities and communities are destroyed by the fighting.</p>

<p>Today we have all been able to see: when the state returned an honest history, the topouse of events makes much sense. Yesterday, May 8, Europe and the worldwide mentioned about the joint victory over the aggression of Nazism, the surrender of the evil. And today, May 9, we, along with all Free Europe, celebrating the day of Europe, honoring the achievements that just did not have been victorism ,-said Vladimir Zelensky in his address at the end of the 440th day of the war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would not have such a united Europe - Europe without aggression and revenge, Europe, which respects different cultures, which overcomes the disputes exclusively in the legal region and which is proud of diversity on our continent. The more people will be a fair story that will see more common between the cruel aggression and the 21st centuries, the more they appreciate this sequence. Memorial Day of Nazism in World War II, and immediately behind it is the Day of Europe, Europe as a realized dream of a peaceful continent. And this is just a matter of time, the Kolyma will be able to restore the sustainable and just peace for our part of Europe, for Ukraine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only a matter of time when the present aggressor loses how the aggressor that has played 78 years ago, when Russian revanchism will be crushed by the courage of the most soldiers and the common force of the free world.</p>

<p>About it <a href="https://www.rada.gov.ua/news/news_kom/236274.html">writes</a>The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine press service on the official webport of parliament.</p>
<p>Today, Ukraine celebrates Europe Day with the European Union.</p>
<p>After the bloody World War II, many peoples of Europe united to confront the enemies of the civilized and democratic world together and prevent the mistakes of the past. Today, as it is then, Europe is united to oppose the dictator with imperial dreams and the criminal regime in general. Todinacists could not break the free world. This will not work for the Russians now.</p>
<p>Today there are fierce battles in Ukraine. Ukrainians are not only fighting freedom, independence and European future. They defend the world's democratic values on the battlefield. And despite all the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the Tadiplomatic Front, Russian invaders are not going to stop. They see that they will be able to break the Ukrainian spirit with their terrorist and capture our territories.</p>
<p>Now each of us should help Ukraine withstand, continue to develop warfare and win. Each of us should help the defenders and defenders as soon as possible to release the territory of Ukraine. The smallest thing to do is take a telephone in your hands and report collaborators, racists and hostile technicians.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation Committee calls for informing and sending information on the social network "Telegrams" about hostile equipment, collaborators of Irodian killes who committed atrocities in the occupied territories to:</p>
<p>-Chat-bot of Ministor Evorog-<a href="https://t.me/evorog_bot">t.me/evorogo_bot</a>;</p>
<p>-Chat Boto SBU Stop Russian War-<a href="https://t.me/stop_russian_war_bot">t.me/stop_russian_war_bot</a>.</p>
<p>Також повідомляйте ДСНС про вибухонебезпечні предмети.</p>
<p>Для швидшої деокупації тимчасово окупованих територій Збройним Силам Українипотрібна інформація від народної розвідки Криму, Луганської, Донецької,Запорізької та Херсонської областей. Пишіть всю інформацію, яку знаєте,особливо про розташування:</p>
<p>— ракетних комплексів С300 та Іскандер;</p>
<p>— систем зв’язку та засобів радіоелектронної боротьби;</p>
<p>— бензовозів;</p>
<p>— скупчення і переміщення техніки та особового складу;</p>
<p>— позицій артилерії;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>field aerodromes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ammunition warehouses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the dislocation or place of residence of the troops of the Russians.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an unstable connection and do not download photos or videos, write a detailed description of the text. The more the Armed Forces will receive your observations, the more quickly eliminate all the invaders.</p>
<p>Also, do not forget to report collaborators and explosive objects. Consults are not only in the occupied territories of the country, but also in our country. They help the racists in every possible way to destroy our lives, adjust fire, organize referendums, drain data, help the occupiers and campaign of Ukrainians to support Putin.</p>
<p>If you have facts that confirm that a person stands on the side of the enemy - immediately report to Chatbota Evorog or STOP Russian War. Send a photo or video or text description why you consider this person a traitor.</p>
<p>Do not forget about the safety rules of popular intelligence!</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation Committee noted that taking photo/video should only be a safe distance and after sending the information to delete the history of correspondence with a jarbot and all the material from the smartphone.</p>

<p>The head of Slovenia Parliament congratulated Ukraine with the status of a candidate's membership in the European Union and assured of further support of our government's aspirations to become a full member of the EU and NATO.</p>

<p>She recalled that Romania's Parliament was constantly working on political issues that are important to assist Ukraine, in particular, to recognize the famine of 1932-33 by the genocide of the Ukrainian people and to condemn armed aggression. And this, according to the speaker, will not change as long as the Ukrainian people are not held peace and victory.</p>
<p>We will remind, the NATO summit will take place on July 11-12 in Vilnius.</p>
