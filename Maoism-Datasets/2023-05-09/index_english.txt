 Every year on May 8, Ukraine and the world are celebrated in memory and reconciliation.
The Second World War of 1939-1945 became the largest tragedy of the world in the twentieth century. Having taken tens of millions of lives, breaking the fate of hundreds of millions of people, destroying the entire cities and even Ukraine, she paved her bloody path as well as Ukraine.
The front twice swept the lands of Ukraine - first from west to east, then splits to the west. Millions of Ukrainians have laid their lives for the sake of victory over the Nazma Reconstruction of Peace. Millions have undergone wanderings during and after the end of Vivna, which has been signed over the following decades and has been tangible to now.
The broken fates of those who were in camps or in the forced emigration of the war, the explosions of ammunition, which have been hiding in the ground since the war, have crippled and killed in peacetime, serious illnesses and severe burden of the sums of the dead to today do not let people go to the world.
The Second World War became the largest tragedy of humanity in the twentieth century. To remember it, because the war should not be repeated.
Never again!
Unfortunately, now this slogan did not work.
Again. Again.
Ukrainian and world "Never again!" did not stop Russian aggressors with their "can repeat".
And the Russians repeat. And Ukrainians stop.
The Russians seek to destroy peace and praise the war.
Ukrainians destroy the war and defend peace.
To stop the Russian "can repeat."
To win the Ukrainian and the world - "Never again!".

But in any case, he stressed, it should be about the tribunal.The President stressed that there is a clear consent between the countries that the correspondence of the aggressor for the crime should be inevitable, and the correspondence of the aggressor for the crime of aggression.
"On May 9, 45 after the day before-May 8-the capitulation of Nazi aggression took place, the world was already actively moving to justice about the aggressor. On May 9 this year, our movement is even more active, even more active, and I want to thank all of you for it!Everyone and everyone who abuses the start of the special joint -of -law on the crime of Russia's aggression anti -Ukraine, "Zelensky said.
According to him, Russia should understand that not only in its military settlements, not only how its leadership evaluated our leadership, our state and economic systems, but also in how it evaluated the attitude of Ukraine and the Western countries to justice.
"Our values for us are real. And we will protect them!And so we make it possible that the main culprit of this aggression and all his accomplices were attracted to everything they have committed -without exception!", "Zelensky said.
Now, according to him, the crime of Russia has already put the 21st century on a icing catastrophe. And this crime calls us to justice, emphasized.
"And our justice must be faster than their despair in their bins, which is obviously obvious," Zelensky said.

“There is an official position of Ukraine, official officials: no, not involved and there is no need. Because measures of the Ukrainian security forces and defense are directed to the de -occupation, the liberation of the Ukrainian territories and the disposal of the enemy's military objects, ”the GUR spokesman emphasized.
According to Andrei Yusov, the effect of drones over the Kremlin delegitimizes Putin's regime - shows that he does not control the situation.
“When we talk about the Kremlin, we need to remember that it has different" towers "and live different people, often with different, and sometimes even with opposite interseres. Therefore, the inhabitants of certain "towers" could well be involved, " - added Andrey Yusov.

“Our Europe has become possible due to the victory over the evil of aggression and ideology. Our Europe, which is based on respect for peoples and brings together differentizations, does not conquer, but combines common values. Our Europe is becoming stalmozing when the evil of aggression was defeated, ”Vladimirzelensky said.
The President noted that Ukraine will always be grateful to anyone who has struggled with anti -science and won.
"Victory has opened a historic space for unifying efforts in Europe, and it was an obvious that it was then that efforts should be for peace, for the sake of peace," he added.
The head of state quoted the first sentence of Schuman's declaration, which states that the world in the world cannot be secured without construction efforts, proportional to the dangers that threaten him.
“Now, when we are again opposed to the evil aggression and hatred policy that modern Russia has returned to the continent, when we need victory again, we again turn to the meaning of those words from Schuman's declaration. Our efforts of the united Europe, for the sake of security and peace, should be as exaggerated as Russia's desire is to destroy our security, navigation, our Europe. We have to act in a proportionate threat - not weaker, —This to defeat this evil of aggression so that new generations of Europeans can so self -reproduce the Day of Europe in peace, and not just remember that there was once a Takoeste and that there was peace on the continent, ”the president is convinced.
Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the partners of Ukraine for the protection of the European continent and values of freedom, as well as the President of the European Commission - the Cossack decisions that are needed throughout Europe.In this context, the Head of State expressed gratitude to Ursula von der Liaien's preparedness to give Ukraine the necessary ammunition - 1 million shells for artillery. He noted that at a meeting with the President of the European Commission, the issue of speed of purchase and supply of ammunition was discussed.
In addition, during the negotiations, the leaders touched on the issue of sanctions on Russia.
“We are counting on the adoption in the near future of the 11th sanction package, and it should be sanctions against the nuclear industry of the terrorist state. Then the power of the package will be a proportional level of threat, ”the President said.
 The meeting also discussed the steps on the further unification of Ukraine of the Tai -European Union.
“It has long been time to eliminate artificial political uncertainty between Ukraine and the European Union. It is time for a positive decision to interpret negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the EU. Our values, safety, our precision, peace on the continent - all this can be realized one hundred percent for Evrop only with Ukraine, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced.
The head of state stressed that our country expects to obtain in June a positive evaluation of the European Commission on Ukraine's progress on pathways.
The President of Ukraine and the President of the European Commission discussed the situation on export -Ukrainian agrarian products.
“We have a common consent to the importance of our Ukrainian contribution to the global food safety of the world and have common examples of success in the food. In particular, this applies to programs such as our humanitarian initiative "Grain from Ukraine" as our "Ways of Solidarity", - said Vladimirzelensky.
The head of state stressed that Ukraine today faced the problems of fatigue, where Europe should demonstrate strong manifestations of solidarity, proportional to the existing threats.
“Hard, even cruel as a time of war, protectionist measures cannot be disappointed with our sidings. Any restrictions on our export are now absolutely unacceptable. Because it does not intensify us all in Europe, the alteration of the aggressor, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.
The President noted that Ukraine proposes to start a consulting group to monitor the relevant problematic issues and refrain from any decision-making without consultation with our country.For his part, the President of the European Commission Ursula von Der Lyen stressed that the Council to be in Kyiv on May 9, which was proclaimed on the initiative of President Vladimirrazelsky on the Day of Europe.
“We warmly welcome your decision to make May 9 in Ukraine on May 9 in Ukraine. Kyiv as a history of Ukraine is a heart that fights in unison with European values. Brave Ukraine is fighting for the ideals of Europe, ” - said von der Lyen.
According to her, the regime of Vladimir Putin has destroyed these values in Russia and is to do the same in Ukraine because it is afraid of a successful example that our state demonstrates on the way to the European Union.
“But the aggressor has already made a huge mistake. Ukraine has withstood this offensive, in particular, because Ukrainian society is free. Millions of brave Ukrainians and Ukrainian women fight for their European values, while the invaders are sent to the foremost people from prisons, ”she stated.
The President of the European Commission assured that in its struggle the European Union is standing side by side with Ukraine.

“We reduced imports from Russia by almost two -thirds, depriving it of important income. Thanks to ten successful sanction packages, the Kremlin already pays a large price. And last Friday, the European Commission has approved proposals for the 11th package, which is focused on fighting the bypass of restrictive measures, ”she said.“I want to express my deepest respect for this work. Know that you can put on our knowledge and support in this process that should last, ”the President of the European Commission said.

 On the eve of the next anniversary of the victory over Nazism in the Second World War, Kharkiv was again reappeared. But there is a nuance - they are already net columns of "liberators", which on February 24, 2022 illegally crossed the state border of Ukraine for the purpose of "take Kyiv in three days".
Three locations around Kharkiv opened an exhibition of "Second Army" equipment, which Ukrainian defenders were transformed into scrap throughout the year. She visited one of them.
 At the observation deck of the dull stand: the burnt T-80-the pride of the Rashist boar; Already rustled corps of APR, BMP, AKACAC, Amphibia, Tigers and more. The organizers of the exhibition were signed by each instance, an abusive visitor could see what combat vehicle before him, what they were on and from what the occupiers of Ukrainians were killed from ...

 The organizers came to some signatures with humor - near the potholes of the Ukrainian shells, which destroyed a particular fighting machine, the inscription - "analogue", which is associated with a meme formed from the common statement of Russian propaganda and officials about the presence .(Photo 6)The remains of Russian shells of various calibers and missiles lie as well as the fence behind the fence.

About it reports Office of the President of Ukraine.
Mr. Prosecutor General! 
Good afternoon, dear colleagues, I congratulate you all in this format. 
Dear Ursulo, Dear Colleagues! 
Thank you for the opportunity to work today for the sake of justice!
78 years ago, Europe received perhaps the most important chance in its long history - a chance for a permanent and truly long -term peace.
What was the chance?
Not only in the refusal of aggressions, not only in political instruments that united Europe-once at odds-to prevent any new steps on aggression, any new aggression, but also in punishment. Parking for the aggression that brought the greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century - we all understand that it is the Second World War.
The main culprit of that disaster did not reach the tribunal hall. He himself, Zbuhire, made an obvious sentence for himself. But his accomplices, including the key vision of aggression, were punished in the legal plane. This is exactly how people are punished in a civilized way of punishing any criminals: prosecution, litigation, sentence and its implementation. And this served as a strong support of peace - a specific example when violators of peace were punished by the whole world.
Unfortunately, 68 years after the verdict of the Nuremberg Tribunal, Europe reinforced aggression. She saw that there was a regime that simply does not believe that every world was now able to punish the violators of peace. Russia began in the 14th year of aggression in Ukraine and made it in the 22nd year full-scale, because in the leadership of the movement it prevailed that Europe left the history of historians and everyday and policies of Europe did not dare to really protect their values, unhappy with the new aggression as, As it takes to protect yourself.
We have to prove that the aggressor was wrong in everything!And not only in his military calculations, not only how he evaluated our leadership, our state taeconomic systems. But also in how he evaluated our attitude itself.
Our values for us are real. And we will protect them!And so, we make it possible for the main culprit of this aggression and all his accomplices to be held accountable for everything they have committed - without exception!
This is primarily concerned with the crime of aggression. This crime of Russia has now been entrusted to the border of a global catastrophe. This crime calls us on the right.Our justice should prove international unity in justice, as it was Je Nuremberg. Unfortunately, in the International Criminal Court, whose activity we support, there is no jurisdiction on the crime of aggression. That is why the tribunal is necessary to supplement the global legal system. I am glad to say that in our common group, which works for the punishment of the aggressor - Cenash Sor Group - 37 states. And this number will grow - we will constantly work that our coalition of defenders of justice increases.
Let me remind you that only the state of the state was agreed on the creation of the Nuremberg tribunal. In total, 24 states have been included in the coalition for the sake of the tribunal. It is now significantly more, and not only European countries are not only among us. We argue that the desire for justice is global.
And this summer the International Center for Criminal Prosecution of Russian Aggression will begin work - will begin its work in the Hague. It will be a practical step in the work of materials for the tribunal. So we move forward, we move step by step.
We can discuss among each other what the model of special tribunal in the crime of Russia's aggression against Ukraine should be to achieve the main purpose. We can talk about the order of the steps that will lead the tribunal… We are democratic nations, and speak and agree to us - this is a normal, common thing. But again I emphasize: it should be a tribunal.
I am glad that there is a clear consent between us that the aggressor's responsibility for the crime should be inevitable. And it is the responsibility of the aggressor Zlochin.
On May 9, 45 after the day before-May 8-the capitulation of Nazi aggression took place, the world was already actively moving to justice about the aggressor. On May 9 this year, our movement is even more active, even more number, and I want to thank all of you for it!Thank you to everyone and everyone who will start the start of the special journal on the crime of Russia's aggression anti -Ukraine!
May the chance of our Europe and the world on the sustainable and truly long -lasting peace of aggression will be realized!
Thank you very much!
Glory to Ukraine!

 Coordinating Headquarters on Defense of Prisoners of Pursuing on your Telegram channel reported that this meeting was on the initiative of the public organization "Women made of steel".
The questions were answered by the head of the working group on the interaction of ZImia and relatives of the defenders of the coordination staff Andriy Yusov, the head of the department of sub -department and consulting relatives of the defenders Yuriy Taranyuk, representatives of the National Guard, the Azov Brigade, the National Police and the Security Service of the Red Cross.
Ukraine raises the issue of a terrorist attack in Olenivka at the highest international level. Defenders and defenders, relatives of those who have left in captivity, diplomats at all sites require investigation of this crime. The defense is evidenced by the torture and the Ministry of Foreign Preschools provides these testimony at the interstate level.
“Russia did not provide access to the terrorist attack. We are not silent. The exit from Mariupol was guaranteed that Russia would adhere to the Geneva Conventions, - said Andrei Yusov. -The aggressor country has broken these guarantees. Unfortunately, the red cross under the supervision of the evacuation has not had levers of water -silage to force it to comply with the arrangements. Investigation of the Russian Rules in Bucha was possible because this city was released. It will be Zelenivka. The International Criminal Court has initiated cases of this crime. However, Ukraine is also investigating. The main thing is that a year ago it was possible to protect the lives of Mariupol defenders. Without waiting for the victory and completion of the fighting, we released 2324 defender from captivity. No country was able to achieve such a result during such a conflict. ”
The International Committee of the Red Cross made publications about Olenivka. However, this organization does not have a mandate to condemn any of the parties to the conflict and the privacy policy.
"We have repeatedly tried to access Olenivka after the event of July 292022," said ICCH. - Unfortunately, not everyone and whom they could. They were questioned that people did not disappear. "
They also discussed the prospects for the exchange of "everyone".
“It is a real process, not a story for reassuring. The concept of "all" we and we have different. There will be a great battle around this, ”Andrei Yusov summed up.

The head of the Ukrainian state devoted his speech to courage, because it is self -important in all spheres of life: both in the life of man, in the life of the state, and in the life of the European continent.
“We would be here today if 80 years ago the free peoples of the world did not show sufficient courage to destroy the evil of Nazism? Obviously, if there was a deficiency of courage then, today we would not be here, ”Vladimirzelensky said.
 According to him, after the Second World War, the space of freedom in Europe and almost all over the world was steadily expanding, because the courage of people became more. I will not be able to people with one or another right.
"All you can look at the path that your countries have gone in the struggle for people, in the struggle for our Europe, which we know and appreciate, to do it that it was the path of courage - specific bold people who built our community of free peoples", Said the President.
He emphasized that nowadays we have no right to be illusions that the battle of the praise has already been completed and that the courage will never be needed again.
“This brutal terrorist war conducted by Russia against Ukraine is a reminder of our country, everyone and every one of you personally that courage can be needed today as well as at any other time courage was needed to protect freedom and our European values ”, - the head of state emphasizes.
According to Vladimir Zelensky, personal courage grows into the courage of socialities, peoples and states and as a result - into the courage of the continent.
 The President expressed his belief that it was thanks to the courage that Ukraine and its union will defeat in this cruel war, which Russia resolved, and overcome the Russian ideology of hatred for European freedom.
“And our victory now, when Russian aggression has touched only Ukraine, will do what has not been done in a decisive decade before the Second War. We will destroy the total evil during its roots, when it was not yet aggressive to reach other peoples in Europe, ”the Head of State said.
At the same time, he said, even after our victory, it is impossible to lose their mockery.
“You don't have to lose your courage!No one knows the time when you may have to defend freedom. No one knows exactly how much freedom can occur in a year, after five years. If you have to protect freedom, please be bold!Please do not give your values to those who seek to destroy them. Fight to make the space of freedom neutral. If they didn't do so, today we would not be here. If we are not doing so, will freedom be preserved after us? ”, - said the President of Ukraine.
Volodymyr Zelensky wished every student and a student to find the sphere, their courage will be able to give more freedom and opportunities to the whole of Europe.
"I sincerely wish your generation to pass on to your children even more free, even more secure and even more protected Europe than we can provide now and must ensure," the Head of State said.
 Answering students' questions, Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that nowadays, European values ​​are now in the fight against Russia, so Ukraine can consider Ukraine as a support for a democratic world.
“Ukraine is a wall between absolute autocratia and democracy. And so the foolish stand. In order to be in the future a reliance of powerful tanza land. That is why we keep this wall firmly, ”the President said.
According to the head of state, Europeans also need to realize that citizens, although they were once in the USSR, in essence - Europeans, professes values and, most importantly, protect them today. That is why the EU citizen must continue to support Ukraine and assist in the fight against the Rabbit Aggressor.The President emphasized that the war should end with the withdrawal of Russian troops of the Ukrainian territories and not turn into a frozen conflict of Uevrop.
“We want to displace Russian troops from our territory. We do not want any more than the war. We just want to be free and remind you that not at the President Putin's Presidential Theater, but we are a self -sufficient state, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
He also noted that after the end of the war, Ukraine - the future full EU - will need reconstruction, as many cities and communities are destroyed by the fighting.
“For all this will need help: in work, in development, to the contribution of Ukraine. Therefore, we invite energetic people, students with their ideas, with their knowledge to Ukraine to restore our country, ”the president said.
The Head of State congratulated all those present on Europe Day and invited the next year to celebrate this day in a peaceful Ukraine.

Putin during a speech on Red Square. misinformation: Media of the Russian Federation, with reference to the Russian children's Ombudsmenko M.Low-Belov, reported that “there was an experience when a girl with a cut-out swastika on the back was evacuated from the“ new regions of the Russian Federation. The child failed to save. Therefore, Nazism should not exist. And now the apparatus of the Commissioner for the Rights of the Child is working on the eradication of this phenomenon.

 The Digital Transformation Committee calls for the Armed Forces to be released faster to release Ukraine, having joined the people's intelligence in chatbots about collaborators and hostile equipment in chatbots.
About it writes The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine press service on the official webport of parliament.
Today, Ukraine celebrates Europe Day with the European Union.
After the bloody World War II, many peoples of Europe united to confront the enemies of the civilized and democratic world together and prevent the mistakes of the past. Today, as it is then, Europe is united to oppose the dictator with imperial dreams and the criminal regime in general. Todinacists could not break the free world. This will not work for the Russians now.
Today there are fierce battles in Ukraine. Ukrainians are not only fighting freedom, independence and European future. They defend the world's democratic values on the battlefield. And despite all the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the Tadiplomatic Front, Russian invaders are not going to stop. They see that they will be able to break the Ukrainian spirit with their terrorist and capture our territories.
Now each of us should help Ukraine withstand, continue to develop warfare and win. Each of us should help the defenders and defenders as soon as possible to release the territory of Ukraine. The smallest thing to do is take a telephone in your hands and report collaborators, racists and hostile technicians.
The Digital Transformation Committee calls for informing and sending information on the social network "Telegrams" about hostile equipment, collaborators of Irodian killes who committed atrocities in the occupied territories to:
-Chat-bot of Ministor Evorog- t.me/evorogo_bot ;
-Chat Boto SBU Stop Russian War- t.me/stop_russian_war_bot .
Також повідомляйте ДСНС про вибухонебезпечні предмети.
Для швидшої деокупації тимчасово окупованих територій Збройним Силам Українипотрібна інформація від народної розвідки Криму, Луганської, Донецької,Запорізької та Херсонської областей. Пишіть всю інформацію, яку знаєте,особливо про розташування:
— ракетних комплексів С300 та Іскандер;
— систем зв’язку та засобів радіоелектронної боротьби;
— бензовозів;
— скупчення і переміщення техніки та особового складу;
— позицій артилерії;
field aerodromes;
ammunition warehouses;
the dislocation or place of residence of the troops of the Russians.
If you have an unstable connection and do not download photos or videos, write a detailed description of the text. The more the Armed Forces will receive your observations, the more quickly eliminate all the invaders.
Also, do not forget to report collaborators and explosive objects. Consults are not only in the occupied territories of the country, but also in our country. They help the racists in every possible way to destroy our lives, adjust fire, organize referendums, drain data, help the occupiers and campaign of Ukrainians to support Putin.
If you have facts that confirm that a person stands on the side of the enemy - immediately report to Chatbota Evorog or STOP Russian War. Send a photo or video or text description why you consider this person a traitor.
Do not forget about the safety rules of popular intelligence!
The Digital Transformation Committee noted that taking photo/video should only be a safe distance and after sending the information to delete the history of correspondence with a jarbot and all the material from the smartphone.
