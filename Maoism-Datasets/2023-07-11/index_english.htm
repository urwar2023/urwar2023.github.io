<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-10T38-00-00-04-00/stoltenberg.jpg" />NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg outlined the agenda [NATO Summit(https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/11/09/nastupnyj-samit-nato-vidbudetsya-vlitku-2023-roku-v-lytvi/), which will take place on July 11-12, saying that the meeting will demonstrate the unity of the Alliance.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3451329/nato-chief-details-plans-for-summit/">reports</a>Pentagon press service.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/03/prezydent-ssha-dzho-bajden-prybude-na-samit-nato-u-vilnyusi/">joins</a>The Heads of State and Government of the Alliance are covered by the moment of transatlantic security.</p>
<p>“Russia's aggressive war against Ukraine continues to rage. For 500 days, Moscow carried death and destruction into the heart of Europe, seeking to destroy Ukraine and separate NATO, ”Yen Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>The summit sends a message to Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putinupro that the Alliance is the only one, and his aggression "<a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/07/vilnyuskyj-samit-nato-zrobyt-ukrayinu-sylnishoyu-gensek-alyansu/">not blamed</a>”.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO allies have already promised to allocate 500 million euros for critical needs for Ukraine, including fuel, medical supply, demining equipment and pontoon bridges.</p>
<p>The Alliance leaders will also try to strengthen the protection and restraint with the help of three new regional defense plans, which oppose the main threat - Russia and terrorism.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg also said that the plans of the summit would relate to the Atlantic of the Tai -European Arctic; Baltic region and Central Europe; as well as the Mediterranean and the Black Seas.</p>
<p>Alliance leaders will also consider a plan for defense production to negotiate demand, increase capacity and increase operational compatibility.</p>
<p>NATO allies will also make a more ambitious promise for the investment of the Vaboron - to spend a minimum of 2 percent of the gross internal product annually.</p>
<p>This was made possible after a real increase in defense costs among 31 units.</p>
<p>“In 2023, European allies and Canada will have a real increase in 8.3 percent. This is the highest in the decades and ninth years of a noisy of our defense costs, ”said Jens Stoltenberg.“This year 11 allies will reach or exceed the purpose. We expect that this number will increase significantly, ”the Alliance head said.</p>
<p>The leaders of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will be involved in Uudamiti, as the Alliance's security is not regional but global.</p>
<p>"We are working closely on issues such as cybersecurity, safety of Nagri and new technologies," Yins Stoltenberg stressed.</p>
<p>He also noted that it will be the first summit of the Alliance, in which Finland will take the participation as an ally of NATO, and will also continue work with the fastest accession of Schwedia.</p>
<p>This summit was to be the last for Jens Stoltenberg as a Secretary General, but the Allies <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/04/pivnichnoatlantychna-rada-prodovzhyla-povnovazhennya-yensa-stoltenberga-na-posadi-genseka-nato/">asked</a>It is at least a year.

We observe this in ORDLO and in the Crimea, the person's development stopped back in 2014, when the accumulations were caught there.</p>
<p>As the head of the military intelligence of Ukraine, Major-General Kirilobudanov, “Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories for incomplete human life, has become a Cuba, where the communists have begun to power, and the country's degradation and isolation of the country, and the Kubid, and the Kubyan, have become a Cuba. Reserve stagnation. " Old American cars in Cuba remind that by 1953 and the rebellion of the Communists, there was a rapid economic life. And now innovations, neither investments, nor modern technology, nor important infrastructure.</p>
<p>Comparison of temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories with Cuba is very advisable. These territories should be released immediately to give Ukrainian citizens a chance to occupy the future. Otherwise, these territories will transform the mudic wild field of the 21st century, and humans and their fates - in hostages of imperial ambitions of Kremlin pupils.</p>
<p>Further destruction of obsolete infrastructure, falling social capital, total degradation of education, culture, science, lack of opportunities for any development-this is in fact the price of so-called liberation, which is lied by during the occupation of Ukrainian territories in 2014. The same "Cuba" is grown by the Putin regime in the Transnistria ghetto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched some important reforms - from decentralization, when communities on the ground have received resources and powers for development, as well as administrative services. Ukrainians were given the opportunity to visit other countries of the world, including the European Union without obstacles. The country is socially integrated to the open democratic world.</p>

<p>About it <a href="https://minre.gov.ua/2023/07/10/iryna-vereshhuk-zaklykaye-podavatysya-do-rezervu-praczivnykiv-dlya-roboty-na-deokupovanyh-terytoriyah/">reports</a>Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The event was attended by the Head of the National Agency for the Civil Service Nataliyaalyushina, a permanent representative of the President in the Crimea Tamil Tashev, representatives from the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Health and other interested bodies.</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting noted that since July 3, the information and communication system "Reserve for the Civil Service in the Deoccued Territories" was launched. On the platform <a href="http://reserve.nads.gov.ua/">reserve.nads.gov.ua</a>Anyone can fill the lock and become part of the personnel reserve.</p>
<p>According to Natalia Alyushina, in the first week on the platform registered 350 people, and this figure is constantly increasing. As of today, more than three hundred questionnaires have already been worked out, that is, these people have already been enrolled in the reserve.</p>
<p>Citizens can choose the region on their own. Almost 80% of them choose Crimea. However, other areas are noted: Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>In addition to the restoration of public authorities, it is also important to provide medical services in the liberated territories. The Ministry of Health is currently finalizing the electronic register of workers who are ready to work there.</p>
<p>The challenges that will occur after de -occupation are also concerned with education. First, it is about the return of children to the national education system, as well as the proportion of relevant documents obtained for the DOT.</p>
<p>It is obvious that Ukraine never recognizes the diplomas of the invaders, Irnosheschuk emphasized. At the same time, the official instructed the Ministry of Education and Science to develop a clear algorithm for the recognition of professional qualifications of persons who were forced to study and get a vocabulation education.</p>

<p>Anastasiashurenkova, an expert in the research agency Info Sapiens, has announced this at a press conference at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform Zemform “Attitudes“ Attitudes of Business to Anti -Corruption Tax Reform ”.</p>
<p>The expert referred to the survey data of 500 owners and heads of enterprises-legal entities(at 150 representatives of micro and small businesses and 200th and average and middle)Conducted by the experts of the agency in the form of deep interview.</p>
<p>It turned out that <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-biznes">business</a>Interested in reducing the tax burden to at least 10% and believes that it is the current tax rates that make businesses resort to all sorts of scheme.</p>
<p>“We asked what it was necessary for businesses - such as yours - refused to optimize. Most have said that it was necessary to reduce Nazlaty taxes. The optimum rate is 20%(As for the salary “on your hands”). Тобто, якщо япрацюю в компанії і мені мають заплатити 1000 гривень, то ще 200 гривенькомпанія згодна сплатити як податок. Але не ще одну тисячу чи 500 гривень, якзараз. У сегменті середнього бізнесу багато людей готові платити до 25%. Колиж казати про бажану ставку ПДВ, представники бізнесу майже одностайні: ставкане має перевищувати 10%. Є й ті, хто взагалі за скасування податку на доданувартість. Але ми розуміємо, що в кожній вибірці є до 5% людей, котрівідповідають якось інакше”, - розповіла Шуренкова.</p>
<p>Така ж ситуація і з податком на прибуток. При цьому частина мікробізнесуготова “чесно” сплачувати за ставкою до 15%.</p>
<p>Приблизно таку схему оподаткування і пропонує і Антикорупційна податковареформа, відома також під назвою “реформа 10-10-10”, наголосила дослідниця.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform's own correspondent, General Jens Stoltenberg said this during a press conference in Vilnius after the Soviet Atlantic Council at the level of heads of state and governments.</p>
<p>"We have confirmed that Ukraine will become a member <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato">NATO</a>, and agreed to remove the request for membership. This will change Ukraine's path to membership from a two -year to -one -year process. We also made it clear that we will invite Ukraine to join NATO when the Allies will agree and the speeches will be fulfilled, "he said.</p>
<p>According to Secretary General, this decision is one of the three components, agreed by NATO "to approach Ukraine closer to NATO".</p>
<p>Another element is "a new long -term support program for Ukraine, which will allow to move from the Soviet to the NATO standards of training and doctrines, as well as to rebuild the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine, as well as to cover critical information in medical provision, demining and supply of fuel."</p>

He added that on Wednesday there will be an inauguration of the Council with the participation of President of Ukraine Zelensky.</p>
<p>"This is a strong package for Ukraine and a clear path in the direction of its membership in NATO," the Secretary General said.</p>
<p>He stressed that "Ukraine is now much closer to NATO, especially 2014, when the Alliance members began to assist weapons and teaching and Ukraine demonstrated its capacity and capacity, as well as NATO integrated."</p>
<p>At the same time, Stoltenberg stated that all NATO members agree that "it is not time to do Ukraine by a NATO member until the war is going on." According to him, it is important that Ukraine has won the war -solved war against it, since there is no conversation about membership in the Alliance in a different way.According to him, the absence of a NATO membership in the communique adopted by the communique of NATO is not extraordinary, since "NATO membership in NATO does not have a time frame, and all is due to everything."</p>
<p>As a clarifying question about what conditions should be fulfilled for the NATO Member of Ukraine, Stoltenberg stated that in particular, the Alliance's assessments were fulfilled whether Ukraine fulfilled all the requirements for membership. "There are also conditions partially laid out in Article 10 of the Washington NATO Treaty. And, of course, the Alliance members must assess whether the conditions are fully fulfilled or not. Also about whether all members of the Alliance agree with this, "he said.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg also assured that the decision of NATO summit in Vilnius should not be compared with the decision of the 2008 Bucharest Summit. According to him, one major differences are that the decision of the Vilnius summit makes a requirement for VDCs for Ukraine, and therefore "now there is a single stage instead of two stages." The second difference is the launch of a long -term support program for Ukraine to improve its mutual mutuality and strengthen political ties.</p>

<h1>The result of certification by Russian occupants of teenagers is a military account - a human rights activist</h1>

At the same time, one of the consequences of obtaining such a document is to take military accounting in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Thus, the Director of Advocacy of the ZMINA Human Rights Center, which is a part of the pre -Collection "Ukraine. Five in the morning", Alona Lunova commented <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101826">Ukrainian Radio</a>The fact that in the occupied territories for receiving passports of the Russian Federation 14-year-old teenagers Russia promises "payment of mattern capital", Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"This is another perverted step of the Russian Federation to make as much Ukrainian citizens as possible by passports <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia">Russian Federation</a>. It is a purposeful state policy of the RFCU moment of occupation of Crimea, which is implemented in various forms and after November 24, 2022. However, it was not yet that Ukrainians would stimulate money to hold Russian passports. Apparently, at the rate of certification at the occupying territory they planned, everything is very bad. In particular, it is the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, "Lunova said.</p>
<p>According to the expert, it is difficult to say that the Russians mean the reinforcement of "maternal capital": "Before that he was reserved - it was a form of support of families at birth of another child. Mother capital was taken to a certain age of the child and then issued, in particular, immediately, in particular, For example, for the purchase of housing. What is maternal capital to receive a passport of a Russian citizen is not clear. So far, I have not found such short stories in Russian prosecuting. It may be about something specific for the Opened territories to implement a compulsory policy of conversion of Russian nationality by any methods, including material incentives. "The Director for Advocacy of the ZMINA Human Rights Center also considered how to act as a child if she is against receiving Russian citizenship, and her parents - for: "This is a difficult question, because a child who was in the occupied territory depends on his parents. It is obvious that Russian The authorities can and force passports to receive, because we have already seen the Russian Federation forced parents to receive a passport for a child to get a document on education. It is also a question of any financial assistance, medical care. The Russian Federation creates conditions for the passport to be forced. They have taken such a passport for their child, for Ukraine this citizen is still a citizen of Ukraine. Therefore, if this passport is present, he does not mean anything to the Ukrainian state. "</p>
<p>At the same time, according to the expert, the change of citizenship of children in occupied territories is a war crime. "If someone forced children to change it, the tones, of course, cannot be accused of a war crime. But it should be understood that when the family lives in the occupied territory, then parents understand that if their child does not take a Russian passport, they will be persecuted with teenagers with teenagers Berdyansk Nikita and Tigran. They were 16 years old, they were killed by the occupiers. And after that, mass inspections of children in the occupied territories began, because the occupiers realized that children could be a source of resistance. The position, not to make a target for the invaders, "Lunova said.</p>
<p>The only serious protection against forced certification, she told, remains departure from the occupied territory: "It is possible not to take the Russian passport, but in the Russian Federation the legislation was changed, which for the occupied territories provides such a concept, a procedure in which a person who lives and did not take it Passport of the Russian Federation will have to get a documentary once. Therefore, they create the conditions under which you either take the Russian passport, or then you will take a residence permit. Therefore, here you also need to be aware that from pressure, persecution, direct coercion with the use of physical violence can only be saved You are not in this territory. If it is impossible to attend the certification, it is necessary to decide: either take a passport, alabuts with conscious negative consequences that can be, or make a decision to leave, " - summed up Lunova.It was reported that earlier the Human Rights Commissioner Dmitry Lubinets <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3728220-lubinec-mi-ne-mozemo-karati-ludej-lise-za-naavnist-pasporta-rf.html">declared</a>that citizens cannot be punished for having a Russian passport - punishment must be applied for specific actions.</p>

The Ukrainian flags of Nalitovsky streets are clearly proving - we are already allies, and Ukraine will protect our own, and your freedom!And never, never and no one can look at Namusvus!</p>
<p>I want to thank you. I thank you, Gitanas!You always help us very much. Thank you, Mr. Chest!And thank you all on the square now!Although the Ukrainian flag is pierced with bullets, but alive, proud and free, - marks that every flag of the nations of Europe will be alive, proud and free. There Bakhmut's Vruins, Russian ambitions will remain in the fields of other battles in Ukraine. And not Ukraine or someone else in our Europe, namely they, Russian invading ambitions, will be in ruins.</p>
<p>Today I went here with faith in a decision, with faith with partners, a beast in a strong NATO. In NATO, which has no doubt, does not lose time and does not not be in mind on any aggressor ... And I would like this faith to be confident-confidence in the decisions we deserve-we all deserve, and some of our warrior, every ours Citizen, every mother, every nasaditin. And is it a lot of desire?</p>
<p><strong> NATO will give Ukraine security. Ukraine will make the Alliance stronger </strong></p>

<p>Therefore, he said, the US administration made a "heavy but necessary selection", giving the Ukrainians a cassette type of shells. In this connection, he signed up that if the United States did not do it, "the Ukrainians ended in ammunition, and they would be defenseless."</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, last Friday the United States announced that it would be supplied to Ukraine with cassette ammunition to help the Armed Forces in the counter -offensive. The use of this weapon is controversy, above all, because a certain percentage of foreign devices does not detonate, but remains on the ground and in the future poses a serious threat to the population even many years after completion of the actions.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T60-00-00-04-00/2-2-scaled.jpeg" />Margus Tsakhkna and Ambassador from special orders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Anton Korinevich</p>
<p>Estonia is one of Ukraine's important partners in the European Union and NATO. A special state that knows the price of Moscow occupation, so it provides our states with a consistent military, diplomatic and economic support. More acquitted cooperation of Estonia and Ukraine, European and Euro -Atlantic prospects for Kiev was told by Estonia Minister of Foreign Affairs Margussakhkn.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T60-00-00-04-00/1-23.jpg" />- <strong> What are your expectations from NATO Vilnius Summit in terms of Ukraine's membership in the Alliance? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Vilnius there is a very important summit. Estonia's position on Ukrainian.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only guarantee of safety for Kiev may be NATO, as well as the diligence of Ukraine in the Alliance in the future.</p>
<p>The only realistic peace plan for Ukraine in this war against Russian aggression is the peace plan of President Zelensky. Whatever the conclusion is, it is vinyl to rely on the decisions of Ukrainians. This is the first.</p>
<p>Reference. Margus Tsakhkna is an Estonian politician and a diplomat. Graduate of the Drug Tartu(theology)and University of Toronto(international law). У2007–2015 роках був депутатом Рійгікогу. У 2015–2016 роках — міністрсоціального захисту Естонської Республіки, у 2016–2017 роках — міністроборони. З квітня 2023 року — міністр закордонних справ Естонії.</p>
<p>По-друге, ми повинні розуміти, що в сусідніх з росією країнах не буде сірихзон (<em>States that are not NATO members. - ed .</em>). Якщо ми хочемо отримативідповідну безпеку в нашому регіоні.</p>
<p>— <strong>Чому засудження російських воєнних злочинів є частиною перемоги України таЄвропи?</strong></p>
<p>— Так, відновлення міжнародного права щодо агресії має вирішальне значення, якви сказали, також для всіх нас. Не тільки для Естонії. Це наша основа —міжнародне право. Тому ми дуже чітко заявляємо, що ніхто не повинен залишатисябезкарним за агресію та інші види порушень міжнародного права.</p>
<p>Існує ініціатива Міжнародного Кримінального Суду щодо розслідування злочинівпроти людства, а також депортації дітей і злочину агресії. путін має яскравийприклад агресії з усіма аспектами. Це надзвичайно важливо зараз, колиміжнародна спільнота має вжити заходів для правової процедури, наприклад,роботу спецтрибуналу.</p>
<p>Головний принцип полягає в тому, що ніхто не повинен користуватися безкарністюцього. Я маю на увазі путіна та його маріонеток.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Why do you think Lennart Mary is relevant now? </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lennart Mary was our first president after our resumption. It is very important to say that we were occupied by Moscow. Meriv spoke a republic, which was proclaimed in 1918.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the current aspect(The Russian-Ukrainian war is referring to. - ed ._)Lennart Mary very clearly said that for small nations, international law is a nuclear weapon to protect himself. Therefore, Estonia supports Ukraine in its struggle for its community freedom and our values. In this way, we restore the rule of international law.</p>
<p>Compliance with international law is vital for all democratic countries and nations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T60-00-00-04-00/3-4.jpeg" />Margussakhkna acts during the Lennart Mary Conference</p>
<p>We need to act not only to restore peace on Ukrainian conditions but also to give(<em> Russian. - ed .</em>)International military criminals under the International Special Tribunal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> There are many regional alliances of Ukraine with international partners, such as the Lublin Triangle. What are the prospects of forming the Regional Alliance of Estonia and Ukraine? </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estonia supports Ukraine in the amount of more than 1% of GDP, and we will be brothers in the reconstruction of Ukraine, reconstruction at different levels. On June 2, the Khitomir opened a kindergarten - this is our first project, which we worked for 9 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is important in the case of the initial project. Estonia has shown that even during the time it can be cooperated, in the aspect, which is also useful for Ukraine. There is bilateral cooperation between governments and local self -government. Also, purchases that took place in EU and EU.</p>
<p>This experience can be used in the further reconstruction of Ukraine from the names of the Seven, European Commission.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T60-00-00-04-00/4-15.jpg" />Margussakhkna and Ambassador of Ukraine to Estonia Maxim Kononenko</p>
<p>And, of course, any development of public administration, IT, electronic government, combating corruption, transparent purchases. We have such experience Westonia, as well as working closely with Ukraine.</p>
<p>We consider Estonia as a center for the reconstruction of Ukraine with the support of the EU of the Zakhida world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> What impact will Finland membership in NATO for the Baltic and Eastern Europe will have? </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a huge influence through the political decision that the Finnish people made, completing the period of neutrality after the Second World War. The introduction of Finland Donato is extremely important for the Northern Europe and Baltic region.As a former Estonian Defense Minister, I understand what military potential the Finland has in our region. We have joint plans embodied in realness in our region. This is why we are very pleased - the value of the Baltic Sea, as well as regional cooperation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like nations belonging to the same family with the same values. This really increases our regional defense cooperation.</p>
<p>The Finland's accession to NATO has at least two very important results. One is a change in the outlook at the political level as a nation's decision and the second is practical cooperation.</p>
<p>So, we are witnessing dramatic changes in the safety of the Baltic-Scandinavian Region.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> What is your position on the EU and the chances of Ukraine to start negotiating this year? </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are very careful about the process of Ukraine on seven EU recommendations on the part of the EU also on their implementation and the beginning of negotiations on accession to the EU as a full member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Estonia, we have such experience from 2003-2004, when our country has joined the European Union.</p>
<p>The first moment is political will. The second is the reforms and legislation that Ukraine adheres to. But we are talking not only about the bill, but also real reforms.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T60-00-00-04-00/5-13.jpg" />Margussakhkna and Foreign Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba</p>
<p>Estonia encourages Ukrainians to change, we teach them. In May we had a group of Ukrainian high -ranking officials here in Estonia. And we discussed how to comply with the European Commission.</p>
<p>We also urge Ukrainians to follow the EU recommendations not only 100%, but also 120%. I am sure that at the end of 2023 everything will be done. Of course, the European Commission will closely observe all the processes and results of reforming Ukraine.</p>
<p>Our vision is clear - only then in the EU should start the negotiation process. Of course, it will take some time. Then it will be a practical value for the process of integration and the process of transformation of Ukraine's entry into our European family.</p>

<h3><strong> “The main purpose of such activities is to exchange experience” </strong></h3>
<p>According to the speakers themselves, the main purpose of such measures is to exchange experience, to pay attention to the community on the importance of psychological training of the person's battlefield.</p>
<ul>
<li>Servicemen at their level of psychological preparedness should understand four basic doctrines: the idea of staying in the army, understanding of meanings, the importance of leadership in the unit, the effectiveness and practicality of what they are making personally and accordingly what the unit is doing. These levels of training are engaged in a group of combat stress, which should also respond to the crisis and the condition of the soldier. But it is clear that we cannot put a psychologist near each soldier, so they must control psychological pressure so that the person does not break, but harden and is ready for psycho -emotional stress situations, - said Vladislav Sinyagovsky.</li>
</ul>

With regard to the issue of membership, I also expect that the Alliance members will send a clear and positive signal to the path of Ukraine's membership in the Alliance, ”Yens Stoltenberg said.</li>
</ul>

<p>Законопроєктом передбачається визначення на законодавчому рівні поняття«адаптивний спорт» як діяльності суб’єктів сфери фізичної культури і спорту,спрямованої на залучення осіб з інвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнямиповсякденного функціонування до занять фізичною культурою і спортом з метоюсприяння інклюзії та інтеграції до суспільства, фізичній, психологічнійреабілітації, сприяння можливості ведення самостійного способу життя тазалученості до місцевої спільноти, а також окреслити його як напрям фізичноїкультури.</p>
<p>Запропонований напрям фізичної культури підвищить адаптацію осіб зінвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнями повсякденного функціонування до умов життя,що змінилися, розширить їхні функціональні можливості, сприятиме відновленнюфізичного та ментального здоров’я, реінтеграції зазначеної категорії осіб досуспільства під час та у післявоєнний період, поверненню відчуття соціальноїповноцінності.</p>
<p>Безбар’єрність — це не просто про комфортне життя для всіх груп населення, аіноді про життя взагалі, про розвиток. Бар’єри, які існують сьогодні всуспільстві — фізичні, громадянські, освітні економічні та інші — недозволяють мільйонам українцям, серед яких маломобільні люди, молодь, жінки,люди літнього віку, реалізувати себе.</p>
<p>Відновлення України, її фізичного і загалом суспільного простору, даєможливість виправити ці помилки минулого, зокрема однією з основних з яких єбар’єри між різними суспільними групами — фізичні, громадянські, освітні,економічні тощо.</p>
<p>Створення безбар’єрного простору під патронатом першої леді Олени Зеленської зкожним днем наближає Україну до європейських стандартів безбар’єрності.</p>

The results of the decisions made today at the working meeting were announced by the Secretary General of the Alliance Jens Stoltenberg during a press conference. About it reports our correspondent from Vilnius.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg answered the main questions that most concerned the sowing of Ukrainians - this is, of course, the official invitation of Ukraine to NATO, as well as planes for Ukraine.</p>
<p>During the Jens Stoltenberg Conference, he said that the NATO NATO approaches to the Alliance had already been adopted - Ukraine will be invited, but after complying with "certain conditions". In the meantime, the path to NATO is shrinking due to the cancellation of MAPs - that is, instead of a two -stage path, Ukraine is offered one -stage. He also depicted that the Alliance ** coordinates a powerful package of assistance to Ukraine, enhanced the intensification of troops, restraint and defense.</p>
<h3><strong> On the decision to bring Ukraine closer to NATO </strong></h3>
<p>During the final press conference, the Jens Stoltenberg noted that the text Communke on the path of Ukraine to NATO has already been agreed and there is a formulation of Ukraine's request to the Alliance's family, but as already noted under certain conditions. He also emphasized that the tools of fulfilling these conditions were prescribed.</p>
<p>In particular, Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the Alliance members agreed a package of three elements that bring Ukraine closer to NATO.</p>
<p>The first is the heads of state and governments of NATO member states agreed to cancel a demand for a member of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have confirmed that Ukraine would become a member of NATO, and agreed to remove the demand for a plan of action on membership. This will change Ukraine's path to membership from a two -year one -time process. We also made it clear that we will invite Ukraine to join NATO when the Allies will agree and the conditions will be fulfilled, ”he said.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, this decision is one of the three components, agreed by NATO "to bring Ukraine closer to NATO".</p>
<ul>
<li>I am very active in working with the members of the Alliance and with Ukrainian governmental persons, including Mr. Vladimir Zelensky, - NATO General.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another element is "a new long -standing assistance program designed to facilitate the transition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Soviet standards to NATO and to help rebuild the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine, meeting such fuel, such as fuel, demining equipment and medicines.The Alliance Secretary General also reminded that tomorrow, on the second day of the summit, an inaugural meeting of the Council with the participation of President of Ukraine Volodymyrazellensky will be approached.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-11T94-00-00-04-00/d28782c3-a34a-45fe-b4bf-b161766e7cd3.jpg" />- This is a strong package for Ukraine and a clear path to the direction of its membership in NATO, - the Alliance's Secretary General.</p>
<p>He also stressed that "Ukraine is now much closer to NATO, especially after 2014, when the Alliance began to assist the weapons of the Armed Forces and Ukraine has demonstrated its capabilities and capacity, and it became more integrated with NATO."</p>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine should not be performed by the MAP. But, I want to say that I was in 2008 as part of the Netherlands government delegation. At that time, the masters were created why the refusal of Ukraine to provide the MAP was. And one of the reasons that she(Ukraine - ed.)It was very far from NATO, including the standards and equipment. Currently, Ukraine has demonstrated its capacity, capacity and is more integrated in NATO than then. Now the fact that Ukraine has provided a lot of equipment and weapons from NATO countries, and now the training of pilots will now be able to come up with NATO, ”the Jens Stoltenberg said.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, Jens Stoltenberg stated that all NATO members agree that "not timely to produce Ukraine with a member of NATO until the war is going on."</p>
<p>According to him, it is important that Ukraine wins the Russian -won against it, because otherwise the membership in the Alliance has not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>According to him, the absence of a NATO membership in the company adopted by the communique of Ukraine is not extraordinary, since "NATO membership in NATO does not have time frames, and all the conditions are always conditioned."</p>
<p>As a clarifying question about what conditions should be fulfilled for the NATO Member of Ukraine, Mr. Stoltenberg said that, in particular, the admonition of the Alliance's members of whether Ukraine fulfilled all the requirements for membership.</p>
<ul>
<li>certain conditions are partly stipulated in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty of NATO. And, of course, the Alliance members should evaluate whether they are fully fulfilled or not. Ivan, here should be discussed by members of the Alliance. I am not only talking about consultations here, but also whether all the Alliance members agree with it, - he said.### <strong> O </strong> <strong> NATO defense plans </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, according to Mr. Stoltenberg, today, the members of the Alliance have approved "the most complex defensive plans from the end of the Cold War." New regional plans are intended for counteraction to two major threats to the Alliance-Russia and terrorism-provide for the maintenance of 300,000 servicemen in a state of increased readiness, including significant military-air and naval forces and means.</p>
<p>The members of the Alliance also adopted a new plan for defense production aimed at accelerating joint purchases, strengthening production power and increasing the operational compatibility of the Alliance members.</p>
<p>For the sake of meeting their defense needs, the Alliance members took the sebellist to invest at least 2% of their gross domestic product in defense(GDP). Європейські члени Альянсу і Канада зафіксували збільшеннясвоїх оборонних бюджетів на 8,3 відсотка в реальному вимірі в 2023 році, що єнайбільшим зростанням за останні десятиріччя.

<p>Члени Альянсу також обговорили виклики, які Китай кидає євроатлантичнійбезпеці і цінностям.</p>
<p>— Китай не є нашим супротивником, і ми повинні продовжувати взаємодіяти, —сказав Генеральний секретар НАТО, підкресливши, що «зростаюча напористістьПекіна впливає на нашу безпеку» і кидає виклик міжнародному порядку,заснованому на правилах.</p>
<p>Пан Столтенберг також нагадав, що завтра члени Альянсу зустрінуться з лідерамиАвстралії, Японії, Нової Зеландії і Південної Кореї, а також ЄвропейськогоСоюзу.</p>
