Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO allies have already promised to allocate 500 million euros for critical needs for Ukraine, including fuel, medical supply, demining equipment and pontoon bridges.

 The Russian measure brings with it only degradation, destruction and archaic, rejecting people in the pre -industrial era. We observe this in ORDLO and in the Crimea, the person's development stopped back in 2014, when the accumulations were caught there.
As the head of the military intelligence of Ukraine, Major-General Kirilobudanov, “Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories for incomplete human life, has become a Cuba, where the communists have begun to power, and the country's degradation and isolation of the country, and the Kubid, and the Kubyan, have become a Cuba. Reserve stagnation. " Old American cars in Cuba remind that by 1953 and the rebellion of the Communists, there was a rapid economic life. And now innovations, neither investments, nor modern technology, nor important infrastructure.
Comparison of temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories with Cuba is very advisable. These territories should be released immediately to give Ukrainian citizens a chance to occupy the future. Otherwise, these territories will transform the mudic wild field of the 21st century, and humans and their fates - in hostages of imperial ambitions of Kremlin pupils.
Further destruction of obsolete infrastructure, falling social capital, total degradation of education, culture, science, lack of opportunities for any development-this is in fact the price of so-called liberation, which is lied by during the occupation of Ukrainian territories in 2014. The same "Cuba" is grown by the Putin regime in the Transnistria ghetto.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched some important reforms - from decentralization, when communities on the ground have received resources and powers for development, as well as administrative services. Ukrainians were given the opportunity to visit other countries of the world, including the European Union without obstacles. The country is socially integrated to the open democratic world.

 The other day in the heroic Irpin city on the shore of the picturesque lake there was a festive-eagle action. The event became an integral part of the rehabilitation for the military units of the three Armed Forces of Ukraine, which, while on a short rest of the reflection, undergo psychological decompression in their hometown. They were joined by local residents and guests of friendly Lithuania. Correspondent Armyinform attended the event and talked with its participants. 
Ukrainian ethnic music as if a magnet was tightened by Irpen residents at the Star Nation Fund, located on the picturesque Berezhevlyak Lake. At the very edge of water, on a cozy wooden pier, cut with rocks from Rashist shelling, sang, danced traditional folkuple rites of artists of the band "Royal". The pioneering Kupala act prevailed on a makeshift stage on the water.

 They wore wreaths together, sang Ukrainian folk songs, and played in Kupala games, tied colored ribbons to the tree, whispering, apparently, apparently every Ukrainian and Lithuanian about the Russian aggressor. It was felt that the trials that they had to endure in the winter and in the spring of last year and sincere immersion of venetical self -consciousness, to knowledge of culture, traditions, ethnic idealized, the participants of this collective psychotherapy. They have become, as a single -born, who is confident in their abilities and wants to build their own happy future of dwarfed values, which were in vain to erase from the people's memory "Denacifiers".
 
 - I was personally impressed by the authentic Ukrainian songs with deep content, ancient customs. It was extremely interesting for me and my children to know the stability of the Ukrainian nation, - shared her impressions of Gulnarapozharene, volunteer of the Lithuanian International Charity Fund "Krylodobroma"(Wing of help). — Це надихає на подальшу співпрацю, на допомогу,надає сил. Ми показуємо у Литві всі ці руйнування, те, що пережили мужніукраїнці під час російської навали, як вони згуртувались та як завзятовідновлюють свою країну. Литовці історично дуже близькі Україні, тонковідчувають цей зв'язок, тому сильно переймаються її долею та допомагають.

Але не ще одну тисячу чи 500 гривень, якзараз. У сегменті середнього бізнесу багато людей готові платити до 25%. Колиж казати про бажану ставку ПДВ, представники бізнесу майже одностайні: ставкане має перевищувати 10%. Є й ті, хто взагалі за скасування податку на доданувартість. Але ми розуміємо, що в кожній вибірці є до 5% людей, котрівідповідають якось інакше”, - розповіла Шуренкова.

 The heads of NATO member states and governments have agreed to cancel the request for a member of Ukraine and stated that they would provide an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance after "fulfilling conditions".
According to Ukrinform's own correspondent, General Jens Stoltenberg said this during a press conference in Vilnius after the Soviet Atlantic Council at the level of heads of state and governments.
"We have confirmed that Ukraine will become a member NATO , and agreed to remove the request for membership. This will change Ukraine's path to membership from a two -year to -one -year process. We also made it clear that we will invite Ukraine to join NATO when the Allies will agree and the speeches will be fulfilled, "he said.
According to Secretary General, this decision is one of the three components, agreed by NATO "to approach Ukraine closer to NATO".
Another element is "a new long -term support program for Ukraine, which will allow to move from the Soviet to the NATO standards of training and doctrines, as well as to rebuild the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine, as well as to cover critical information in medical provision, demining and supply of fuel."
Read also: Biden supported the formulation of NATO on the future of Ukraine in the Alliance Stoltenberg noted that the third element is the creation of a new Ukraine-NATO Council, which he called the "forum for crisis consultations and decision-making", where we "we will be wearing as equal". He added that on Wednesday there will be an inauguration of the Council with the participation of President of Ukraine Zelensky.
"This is a strong package for Ukraine and a clear path in the direction of its membership in NATO," the Secretary General said.
He stressed that "Ukraine is now much closer to NATO, especially 2014, when the Alliance members began to assist weapons and teaching and Ukraine demonstrated its capacity and capacity, as well as NATO integrated."
At the same time, Stoltenberg stated that all NATO members agree that "it is not time to do Ukraine by a NATO member until the war is going on." According to him, it is important that Ukraine has won the war -solved war against it, since there is no conversation about membership in the Alliance in a different way.According to him, the absence of a NATO membership in the communique adopted by the communique of NATO is not extraordinary, since "NATO membership in NATO does not have a time frame, and all is due to everything."
As a clarifying question about what conditions should be fulfilled for the NATO Member of Ukraine, Stoltenberg stated that in particular, the Alliance's assessments were fulfilled whether Ukraine fulfilled all the requirements for membership. "There are also conditions partially laid out in Article 10 of the Washington NATO Treaty. And, of course, the Alliance members must assess whether the conditions are fully fulfilled or not. Also about whether all members of the Alliance agree with this, "he said.
Stoltenberg also assured that the decision of NATO summit in Vilnius should not be compared with the decision of the 2008 Bucharest Summit. According to him, one major differences are that the decision of the Vilnius summit makes a requirement for VDCs for Ukraine, and therefore "now there is a single stage instead of two stages." The second difference is the launch of a long -term support program for Ukraine to improve its mutual mutuality and strengthen political ties.
As reported by Ukrinform, July 11-12 NATO summit takes place in Vilnius .
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday paid attention that Vilnius without Ukraine discusses the formulation of the conditions of the invitation(Even non -non -non -infirmity)in NATO.

 The accusations of collaborationism upon receipt of a passport of the Russian Federation by teenagers of nailed territories can not be, since the Criminal Code of Ukraine is not spelled out. At the same time, one of the consequences of obtaining such a document is to take military accounting in the Russian Federation.
Thus, the Director of Advocacy of the ZMINA Human Rights Center, which is a part of the pre -Collection "Ukraine. Five in the morning", Alona Lunova commented Ukrainian Radio The fact that in the occupied territories for receiving passports of the Russian Federation 14-year-old teenagers Russia promises "payment of mattern capital", Ukrinform reports.
"This is another perverted step of the Russian Federation to make as much Ukrainian citizens as possible by passports Russian Federation . It is a purposeful state policy of the RFCU moment of occupation of Crimea, which is implemented in various forms and after November 24, 2022. However, it was not yet that Ukrainians would stimulate money to hold Russian passports. Apparently, at the rate of certification at the occupying territory they planned, everything is very bad. In particular, it is the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, "Lunova said.
According to the expert, it is difficult to say that the Russians mean the reinforcement of "maternal capital": "Before that he was reserved - it was a form of support of families at birth of another child. Mother capital was taken to a certain age of the child and then issued, in particular, immediately, in particular, For example, for the purchase of housing. What is maternal capital to receive a passport of a Russian citizen is not clear. So far, I have not found such short stories in Russian prosecuting. It may be about something specific for the Opened territories to implement a compulsory policy of conversion of Russian nationality by any methods, including material incentives. "The Director for Advocacy of the ZMINA Human Rights Center also considered how to act as a child if she is against receiving Russian citizenship, and her parents - for: "This is a difficult question, because a child who was in the occupied territory depends on his parents. It is obvious that Russian The authorities can and force passports to receive, because we have already seen the Russian Federation forced parents to receive a passport for a child to get a document on education. It is also a question of any financial assistance, medical care. The Russian Federation creates conditions for the passport to be forced. They have taken such a passport for their child, for Ukraine this citizen is still a citizen of Ukraine. Therefore, if this passport is present, he does not mean anything to the Ukrainian state. "
At the same time, according to the expert, the change of citizenship of children in occupied territories is a war crime. "If someone forced children to change it, the tones, of course, cannot be accused of a war crime. But it should be understood that when the family lives in the occupied territory, then parents understand that if their child does not take a Russian passport, they will be persecuted with teenagers with teenagers Berdyansk Nikita and Tigran. They were 16 years old, they were killed by the occupiers. And after that, mass inspections of children in the occupied territories began, because the occupiers realized that children could be a source of resistance. The position, not to make a target for the invaders, "Lunova said.
The only serious protection against forced certification, she told, remains departure from the occupied territory: "It is possible not to take the Russian passport, but in the Russian Federation the legislation was changed, which for the occupied territories provides such a concept, a procedure in which a person who lives and did not take it Passport of the Russian Federation will have to get a documentary once. Therefore, they create the conditions under which you either take the Russian passport, or then you will take a residence permit. Therefore, here you also need to be aware that from pressure, persecution, direct coercion with the use of physical violence can only be saved You are not in this territory. If it is impossible to attend the certification, it is necessary to decide: either take a passport, alabuts with conscious negative consequences that can be, or make a decision to leave, " - summed up Lunova.It was reported that earlier the Human Rights Commissioner Dmitry Lubinets declared that citizens cannot be punished for having a Russian passport - punishment must be applied for specific actions.

 Margus Tsakhkna and Ambassador from special orders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Anton Korinevich
Estonia is one of Ukraine's important partners in the European Union and NATO. A special state that knows the price of Moscow occupation, so it provides our states with a consistent military, diplomatic and economic support. More acquitted cooperation of Estonia and Ukraine, European and Euro -Atlantic prospects for Kiev was told by Estonia Minister of Foreign Affairs Margussakhkn.
 - What are your expectations from NATO Vilnius Summit in terms of Ukraine's membership in the Alliance? 
The only guarantee of safety for Kiev may be NATO, as well as the diligence of Ukraine in the Alliance in the future.
The only realistic peace plan for Ukraine in this war against Russian aggression is the peace plan of President Zelensky. Whatever the conclusion is, it is vinyl to rely on the decisions of Ukrainians. This is the first.
Reference. Margus Tsakhkna is an Estonian politician and a diplomat. Graduate of the Drug Tartu(theology)and University of Toronto(international law). У2007–2015 роках був депутатом Рійгікогу. У 2015–2016 роках — міністрсоціального захисту Естонської Республіки, у 2016–2017 роках — міністроборони. З квітня 2023 року — міністр закордонних справ Естонії.
По-друге, ми повинні розуміти, що в сусідніх з росією країнах не буде сірихзон ( States that are not NATO members. - ed . ). Якщо ми хочемо отримативідповідну безпеку в нашому регіоні.
— Чому засудження російських воєнних злочинів є частиною перемоги України таЄвропи? 
— Так, відновлення міжнародного права щодо агресії має вирішальне значення, якви сказали, також для всіх нас. Не тільки для Естонії. Це наша основа —міжнародне право. Тому ми дуже чітко заявляємо, що ніхто не повинен залишатисябезкарним за агресію та інші види порушень міжнародного права.
Існує ініціатива Міжнародного Кримінального Суду щодо розслідування злочинівпроти людства, а також депортації дітей і злочину агресії. путін має яскравийприклад агресії з усіма аспектами. Це надзвичайно важливо зараз, колиміжнародна спільнота має вжити заходів для правової процедури, наприклад,роботу спецтрибуналу.
Головний принцип полягає в тому, що ніхто не повинен користуватися безкарністюцього. Я маю на увазі путіна та його маріонеток.
Why do you think Lennart Mary is relevant now? 
Lennart Mary was our first president after our resumption. It is very important to say that we were occupied by Moscow. Meriv spoke a republic, which was proclaimed in 1918.
In the current aspect(The Russian-Ukrainian war is referring to. - ed ._)Lennart Mary very clearly said that for small nations, international law is a nuclear weapon to protect himself. Therefore, Estonia supports Ukraine in its struggle for its community freedom and our values. In this way, we restore the rule of international law.
Compliance with international law is vital for all democratic countries and nations.
 Margussakhkna acts during the Lennart Mary Conference
We need to act not only to restore peace on Ukrainian conditions but also to give( Russian. - ed . )International military criminals under the International Special Tribunal.
There are many regional alliances of Ukraine with international partners, such as the Lublin Triangle. What are the prospects of forming the Regional Alliance of Estonia and Ukraine? 
Estonia supports Ukraine in the amount of more than 1% of GDP, and we will be brothers in the reconstruction of Ukraine, reconstruction at different levels. On June 2, the Khitomir opened a kindergarten - this is our first project, which we worked for 9 months.
This is important in the case of the initial project. Estonia has shown that even during the time it can be cooperated, in the aspect, which is also useful for Ukraine. There is bilateral cooperation between governments and local self -government. Also, purchases that took place in EU and EU.
This experience can be used in the further reconstruction of Ukraine from the names of the Seven, European Commission.
 Margussakhkna and Ambassador of Ukraine to Estonia Maxim Kononenko
And, of course, any development of public administration, IT, electronic government, combating corruption, transparent purchases. We have such experience Westonia, as well as working closely with Ukraine.
We consider Estonia as a center for the reconstruction of Ukraine with the support of the EU of the Zakhida world.
What impact will Finland membership in NATO for the Baltic and Eastern Europe will have? 
It has a huge influence through the political decision that the Finnish people made, completing the period of neutrality after the Second World War. The introduction of Finland Donato is extremely important for the Northern Europe and Baltic region.As a former Estonian Defense Minister, I understand what military potential the Finland has in our region. We have joint plans embodied in realness in our region. This is why we are very pleased - the value of the Baltic Sea, as well as regional cooperation.
Like nations belonging to the same family with the same values. This really increases our regional defense cooperation.
The Finland's accession to NATO has at least two very important results. One is a change in the outlook at the political level as a nation's decision and the second is practical cooperation.
So, we are witnessing dramatic changes in the safety of the Baltic-Scandinavian Region.
What is your position on the EU and the chances of Ukraine to start negotiating this year? 
We are very careful about the process of Ukraine on seven EU recommendations on the part of the EU also on their implementation and the beginning of negotiations on accession to the EU as a full member.
In Estonia, we have such experience from 2003-2004, when our country has joined the European Union.
The first moment is political will. The second is the reforms and legislation that Ukraine adheres to. But we are talking not only about the bill, but also real reforms.
 Margussakhkna and Foreign Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba
Estonia encourages Ukrainians to change, we teach them. In May we had a group of Ukrainian high -ranking officials here in Estonia. And we discussed how to comply with the European Commission.
We also urge Ukrainians to follow the EU recommendations not only 100%, but also 120%. I am sure that at the end of 2023 everything will be done. Of course, the European Commission will closely observe all the processes and results of reforming Ukraine.
Our vision is clear - only then in the EU should start the negotiation process. Of course, it will take some time. Then it will be a practical value for the process of integration and the process of transformation of Ukraine's entry into our European family.

 Any documents issued in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine are eliminated and are not valid. The forced certification of Russian documents by the inhabitants of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is the unlawful melting is the basis for the loss of Ukrainian citizenship.
This was stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, commenting on the recently adopted normative legal act of Russians, which concerns Ukrainian citizenship in occupied territories. This comment published on the government portal.
It should be noted that on July 6, 2023, the President of the Russian Federation signed Decree N495 No. "On some issues related to the peculiarities of the legal status of citizens of the Russian Federation, who have citizenship Interacting their rights and responsibilities as citizens of Ukraine.
This "normative legal act" is another violation of the legal rights of Ukrainians, who, as a result of armed aggression of the Russian Federation, were forced to stay in the temporary-corresponding territories or were forcibly moved to the territory of the aggressor state.
“In essence, it is the next repressive step in the Russian authorities to find" unreliable ", according to its logic, Ukrainian citizens who, in violation of the law of Ukraine and the norms of international law, were unlawful was unlawful by identification documents of the aggressor country. Such actions by Vladirf, from a legal point of view, are void and do not have any legal consequences. Instead, they are reminiscent of an attempt to create artificial legal principles for reconciliation and other means of pressure on them, ”the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said.
Ukrainian citizens who live in temporarily occupied territories have been transferred to the territory of the Russian Federation under the far-fetched pretext of the so-called "humanitarian protection", will continue to retain the citizenship of Ukraine with any "innovations" of the Russian legislation in this area.

Today, in Vilnius, the Ukrainian battle flag from Bakhmut. Bakhmut is one of the most decisive battles for freedom in Europe, and that is how our children and grandchildren will be remembered. Our Bakhmut's combat flag means that every time the Lithuanians will not have to fight against Russian soldiers either by the Power TV to the TV or any other place of your capital of your country.
About it reported President of Ukraine Zelensky.
Lithuania will always be yours!This flag means that it will never be deport from the Baltic States to Siberia again. There will never be dividing Poland again to humiliate Hungary invaders. There will never be tanks in Prague and Winter Wars against Finland's freedom. No occupation in Europe will no longer be!
Today, I went here with faith in a decision, with faith in partners, the general in the strong NATO. In NATO, which does not doubt, does not lose time and does not do not find any aggressor. And I would like this faith to be confident - confidence in the decisions we deserve - we all deserve - what our warrior, every citizen of our citizen, every mother, every nasaditin. And is it a lot of desire?
NATO will give Ukraine security. Ukraine will make the Alliance stronger.
ŠLOVė ukrainai, ŠLOVė LIETUVAI!

 Today in Vilnius the first day of the summit of the leaders of the countries and the government has ended. The results of the decisions made today at the working meeting were announced by the Secretary General of the Alliance Jens Stoltenberg during a press conference. About it reports our correspondent from Vilnius.
Jens Stoltenberg answered the main questions that most concerned the sowing of Ukrainians - this is, of course, the official invitation of Ukraine to NATO, as well as planes for Ukraine.
During the Jens Stoltenberg Conference, he said that the NATO NATO approaches to the Alliance had already been adopted - Ukraine will be invited, but after complying with "certain conditions". In the meantime, the path to NATO is shrinking due to the cancellation of MAPs - that is, instead of a two -stage path, Ukraine is offered one -stage. He also depicted that the Alliance ** coordinates a powerful package of assistance to Ukraine, enhanced the intensification of troops, restraint and defense.
On the decision to bring Ukraine closer to NATO 
During the final press conference, the Jens Stoltenberg noted that the text Communke on the path of Ukraine to NATO has already been agreed and there is a formulation of Ukraine's request to the Alliance's family, but as already noted under certain conditions. He also emphasized that the tools of fulfilling these conditions were prescribed.
In particular, Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the Alliance members agreed a package of three elements that bring Ukraine closer to NATO.
The first is the heads of state and governments of NATO member states agreed to cancel a demand for a member of Ukraine.
According to him, this decision is one of the three components, agreed by NATO "to bring Ukraine closer to NATO".
Another element is "a new long -standing assistance program designed to facilitate the transition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Soviet standards to NATO and to help rebuild the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine, meeting such fuel, such as fuel, demining equipment and medicines.The Alliance Secretary General also reminded that tomorrow, on the second day of the summit, an inaugural meeting of the Council with the participation of President of Ukraine Volodymyrazellensky will be approached.
 - This is a strong package for Ukraine and a clear path to the direction of its membership in NATO, - the Alliance's Secretary General.
He also stressed that "Ukraine is now much closer to NATO, especially after 2014, when the Alliance began to assist the weapons of the Armed Forces and Ukraine has demonstrated its capabilities and capacity, and it became more integrated with NATO."
At the same time, Jens Stoltenberg stated that all NATO members agree that "not timely to produce Ukraine with a member of NATO until the war is going on."
According to him, it is important that Ukraine wins the Russian -won against it, because otherwise the membership in the Alliance has not yet been discussed.
According to him, the absence of a NATO membership in the company adopted by the communique of Ukraine is not extraordinary, since "NATO membership in NATO does not have time frames, and all the conditions are always conditioned."
As a clarifying question about what conditions should be fulfilled for the NATO Member of Ukraine, Mr. Stoltenberg said that, in particular, the admonition of the Alliance's members of whether Ukraine fulfilled all the requirements for membership.
Thus, according to Mr. Stoltenberg, today, the members of the Alliance have approved "the most complex defensive plans from the end of the Cold War." New regional plans are intended for counteraction to two major threats to the Alliance-Russia and terrorism-provide for the maintenance of 300,000 servicemen in a state of increased readiness, including significant military-air and naval forces and means.
The members of the Alliance also adopted a new plan for defense production aimed at accelerating joint purchases, strengthening production power and increasing the operational compatibility of the Alliance members.
For the sake of meeting their defense needs, the Alliance members took the sebellist to invest at least 2% of their gross domestic product in defense(GDP). Європейські члени Альянсу і Канада зафіксували збільшеннясвоїх оборонних бюджетів на 8,3 відсотка в реальному вимірі в 2023 році, що єнайбільшим зростанням за останні десятиріччя.

Члени Альянсу також обговорили виклики, які Китай кидає євроатлантичнійбезпеці і цінностям.
— Китай не є нашим супротивником, і ми повинні продовжувати взаємодіяти, —сказав Генеральний секретар НАТО, підкресливши, що «зростаюча напористістьПекіна впливає на нашу безпеку» і кидає виклик міжнародному порядку,заснованому на правилах.
Пан Столтенберг також нагадав, що завтра члени Альянсу зустрінуться з лідерамиАвстралії, Японії, Нової Зеландії і Південної Кореї, а також ЄвропейськогоСоюзу.
