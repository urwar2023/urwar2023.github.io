 Despite the fact that Russian propagandists are constantly expressing on the air the desire to undermine the dam of Kiev hydroelectric power station, it is almost impossible to do so.
This was emphasized by the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk in Televahorfon "Edininovy" In an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko.
It is possible to destroy the dam of the Kiev hydroelectric power station only by blasting the inside, as it was made by the Russians with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, or through the use of nuclear weapons.
Instead, it is impossible to cause critical damage to the Kiev hydroelectric power station with rocket strokes.

There were some problem border between Poland and Ukraine, now, according to my information, they are rested, and there are no problems in the transit of goods between Poland and Ukraine. We need information from 22 Member States with the justification of their queries. I hope this decision will be made next week. The main reason for the use of the crisis reserve is that we have a crisis, ”the European Commissioner has taken up.
He recalled that the European Commission has done everything necessary to make it possible to use an extraordinary EU agricultural reserve.

On April 28, the European Commission agreed with the four neighboring countries of Ukraine - Bolgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - a package of measures that the mangiest after the mentioned countries have abolished their sole actions of anti -agrarian imports from Ukraine. This package limits imports into the territory of the aforementioned countries, as well as Romania, four key products from Ukraine - wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, although it preserves the possibility of transit of goods to other EU countries and the world market.
These restrictions were extended within the framework of the already updated duty -free trade between the EU and Ukraine, which provides for such precautionary measures of rebellious circumstances and will be effective until September 15, 2023.

 The deputies of the European Parliament called on NATO Allies to provide Ukraine with a clear personality of membership during a summit in Vilnius in July.
This position was expressed by European politicians at the plenary session of the EP during the hearing on the humanitarian consequences and consequences for the environment for the destruction of the Gykhkhkhkhka, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.
“We have to take decisive steps to a sustainable peace in Europe for the next guys. It requires even more courage than we have already demonstrated. Putin likes when he is afraid of the world. Fear prevented some union countries during a summit in Bucharest to provide a plan for membership for Ukraine. We now have a chance to correct our mistakes, ” - said a representative of the political group of the European People's Party Ras Yuknyavichen.
She reminded that their political group recently approved the drinking of Ukraine's membership in NATO immediately after the end of the war. According to her, this should be done from four causes. First, the preservation of "gray zones" of safety between the West and Russia is a constant voltage. Secondly, trained and equipped armed forces will be a significant added value for Europe. At the same time, Ukraine's integration to Euro-Atlantic structures guarantees a constant peace of Ukraine, and will prevent any attempts by Russia to be revealed to the intestinal and stop its imperial expansionism.
"" Don't be afraid, "said Pope John Paul II in the Soviet times. Ukrainian is not afraid. We also have no decisive steps today. Putin dictatorship has no power, because freedom is power, ”the Lithuanian deputation said.
In turn, the Polish representative Anna Fotiga stressed that undermining the Damikhov hydroelectric power station once again demonstrated the demonic face of the Russian Federation and the need for significant strengthening of assistance to Ukraine.
“We have to respond positively to the will of the Ukrainian people who want to join NATO and the EU, and do it as quickly as possible. Not only for their safety, it is important for the safety of all of us, ”the European Parliamentary.
Her compatriot Radoslav Sikorsky noted that the crime of the Russians in Novikakhovka should be included in the long list of accusations against the Russian Vladi during the International Tribunal. This crime denies any possibility of interruptions with Putin and is the best answer to those who offer them to resolve them. Read also: Duda: Summit NATO has to bring clear decisions of Ukraine's pursuit in the Alliance At the same time, Estonian MP Sven Mixer expressed the opinion that Ukraine's restoration will be long, and this issue cannot wait until the end of the war.
“This process should start now. Russia has to pay for all the damage it has been. Before that, we need to find the legal path how to use the frozen financial assets of the aggressor to partially cover the cost of these efforts. This does not distract us from providing Ukraine with military assistance, as during the time of contrast and the liberation of the occupied territories will grow ... eventually, we have to move quickly and decisively with European and Euro -Atlantic integration of Ukraine. This is the only way to guarantee both Ukrainian and Jewish security, ”the Estonian politician said.
MP Andrus Kublyus stressed that one of the factors why the war was agreed is that Europeans made a great geopolitical mistake for their years held Ukraine in the "gray zone" of European security, without a clear perspective on joining the EU or NATO. Because of this, Putin believed in the weakness of the urgreement and in his ability to capture Ukraine.
"It is time to correct our mistakes that have already cost Ukrainians of thousands of lives. Ukraine should get an invitation to join NATO during a summit in Vilniusii should become a member of the Alliance after the war. Ukraine needs to start negotiating for EU membership by the end of the year in order to complete them by the end of this decade. The teddy path to the sustainable peace we need all on the European continent, ”Kubilus said.

 A conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the simple truth: we have mimic together with partners to ensure physically such conditions that Russian terrorist is impossible.
This was stated in the evening video closer President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.
Viso, Presidential Office, Telegrams 
_ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians! _
This afternoon rescue work and parsing in Kryvyi Cravishly, a rocket attack of terrorists were completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, among them di -evvitin ... My condolences to my relatives and loved ones. There are only more than 30 people injured. They are given the necessary help.
I want to thank everyone and everyone who participated in the rescue operation: SES rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, ordinary people. Thank you for every saved life!Thank you for every person whom they have been now.
This conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the prostitical one: we have to ensure that the Russian terror becomes impossible with our partners.
The first is our air shield. Sufficient number of air defense systems. Plus modern fighters. When the Russian ability to beat in our cities and villages is physically limited by our air shield, only then the terrorist-terrorist will understand that there will be alternatives for all Ukrainians and the loss for all Ukrainians and the loss for Russian.
The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of terrorist rockets by the state. Unfortunately, Russia is still able to obtain critical components for the production of missiles created by companies from around the world, such as companies from some partner countries. In different ways, these components are then supplemented in Russia. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit the Cryvyi Rih now, then about 50 components in it - predominant -electronics - produced in other countries.
And today a meeting of representatives of our country with diplomats of corresponding countries took place. The list of companies that supply Russia for killer components has all partners. There is this list. The understanding of how Russian terrorist is deceiving the world is also in the world. And we are waiting for the conclusions of the fatty actions that will stop Russian rocket terror.It is definitely cheaper - once and for all to block the components for terrorists for terrorists for terror than to constantly spend new and new air defense tracks.
Today, there was a meeting on the preparation of the inevitable, legitimately fair responsibility of Russia for this aggression. We work out several X -molds for the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. The crime must be corresponded to the highest Russian leadership. A crime that is born other crimes of this war. And such responsibility will definitely be. In fact, this is not an easy task. But the Ukrainians have done so much difficult to do so that they will not only do it, but will be fulfilled with pleasure. The tribunal will be.
He met today with the CEO of IAEA Grossi. We are very active to prevent any incidents from the occupied Russian nuclear power plant. While the invaders are there, there is a risk for the world, and this is obvious. Only the complete de -occupation of the station and its return Podu -Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for that.
It is good that the IAEA proposes to send to us, to Ukraine, a group of experts, which appreciate the consequences of the destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. Sleeply to know in all the details of what is happening and what crime against the nature of the music was committed by Russia. I hope the IAEA experts will work in the near future.
And necessarily - our warriors, our characters. Thank you all who are in battle now, who protects and promotes our positions.
For example, the Bakhmut direction-which is, in particular, warriors of the 80th separate brigadidshv ... There is a forward movement in different areas. I thank you!Thank you for the extraordinary hardship!
The units of Tavriya dawn - in the conditions of extremely cruel battles, in the conditions of aviation and artillery advantage of the invaders there is a forward movement!Thank you, warriors!Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is released by the Edental Evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separately mechanized brigade, a 128th separate mountain-assault brigade, paratroopers of our seventystyevatyka, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". Thank you for your strength!
And thank you all in our society, who understands that the liberation of our land then requires difficult, heroic and intense actions that give the back, step by step the necessary power by our offensives!
Glory to Ukrainian heroes!Glory to all in the world who helps! Glory to Ukraine!

 Colonel Yuri Ignatius Air Force Command of the Air Force of Ukraine.
At night, Russia committed another terrorist act-hit the territory of the Ukrainian and X-555 air base, released from the Caspian district. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Army of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, said in the Evil.
The officer emphasized that by their tactics the Russians try to exhaust the Ukrainian air defense:
-In some sections of the front, they launch drones-Kamikadze to spend relatively cheap air targets. In addition, in this way, they try to identify the location of our air defense products to adjust their actions and lay other marrows at the subsequent blows. At the same time, the question of the price of knocking down drones is not worth it, the main thing is to protect Ukrainian cities. But the rationality also needs to be thought-Puniter-Kamikadze is already on the approaches to the Ukrainian borders by those means that require less costs and which, first of all, should be more in our arms today.

 A conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the simple truth: we have mimic together with partners to ensure physically such conditions that Russian terrorist is impossible.
This was stated in the evening video closer President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.
Viso, Presidential Office, Telegrams 
_ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians! _
This afternoon rescue work and parsing in Kryvyi Cravishly, a rocket attack of terrorists were completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, among them di -evvitin ... My condolences to my relatives and loved ones. There are only more than 30 people injured. They are given the necessary help.
I want to thank everyone and everyone who participated in the rescue operation: SES rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, ordinary people. Thank you for every saved life!Thank you for every person whom they have been now.
This conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the prostitical one: we have to ensure that the Russian terror becomes impossible with our partners.
The first is our air shield. Sufficient number of air defense systems. Plus modern fighters. When the Russian ability to beat in our cities and villages is physically limited by our air shield, only then the terrorist-terrorist will understand that there will be alternatives for all Ukrainians and the loss for all Ukrainians and the loss for Russian.
The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of terrorist rockets by the state. Unfortunately, Russia is still able to obtain critical components for the production of missiles created by companies from around the world, such as companies from some partner countries. In different ways, these components are then supplemented in Russia. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit the Cryvyi Rih now, then about 50 components in it - predominant -electronics - produced in other countries.
And today a meeting of representatives of our country with diplomats of corresponding countries took place. The list of companies that supply Russia for killer components has all partners. There is this list. The understanding of how Russian terrorist is deceiving the world is also in the world. And we are waiting for the conclusions of the fatty actions that will stop Russian rocket terror.It is definitely cheaper - once and for all to block the components for terrorists for terrorists for terror than to constantly spend new and new air defense tracks.
Today, there was a meeting on the preparation of the inevitable, legitimately fair responsibility of Russia for this aggression. We work out several X -molds for the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. The crime must be corresponded to the highest Russian leadership. A crime that is born other crimes of this war. And such responsibility will definitely be. In fact, this is not an easy task. But the Ukrainians have done so much difficult to do so that they will not only do it, but will be fulfilled with pleasure. The tribunal will be.
He met today with the CEO of IAEA Grossi. We are very active to prevent any incidents from the occupied Russian nuclear power plant. While the invaders are there, there is a risk for the world, and this is obvious. Only the complete de -occupation of the station and its return Podu -Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for that.
It is good that the IAEA proposes to send to us, to Ukraine, a group of experts, which appreciate the consequences of the destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. Sleeply to know in all the details of what is happening and what crime against the nature of the music was committed by Russia. I hope the IAEA experts will work in the near future.
And necessarily - our warriors, our characters. Thank you all who are in battle now, who protects and promotes our positions.
For example, the Bakhmut direction-which is, in particular, warriors of the 80th separate brigadidshv ... There is a forward movement in different areas. I thank you!Thank you for the extraordinary hardship!
The units of Tavriya dawn - in the conditions of extremely cruel battles, in the conditions of aviation and artillery advantage of the invaders there is a forward movement!Thank you, warriors!Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is released by the Edental Evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separately mechanized brigade, a 128th separate mountain-assault brigade, paratroopers of our seventystyevatyka, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". Thank you for your strength!
And thank you all in our society, who understands that the liberation of our land then requires difficult, heroic and intense actions that give the back, step by step the necessary power by our offensives!
Glory to Ukrainian heroes!Glory to all in the world who helps! Glory to Ukraine!

 This was stated by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg during the announcement of joint statements with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken at the US State Department.
On June 12-13, a visit to Jes Stoltenberg to the United States was made, in which the leader of the novice Atlantic Alliance discussed in Washington the issue of the future summit in Vilnius.
NATO Secretary General has praised the support of allies on the Alliance to strengthen Ukraine's compliance in counteracting Russian aggression.
“I want to thank the United States and President Biden for everything you do to strengthen the transatlantic ties. And, of course, the support you perch Ukraine. European allies also contribute to Ukraine, tens of billions of economic and military support.
The support of NATO allies and partners is changing the situation on the battlefield as Ukrainian Ukrainians have launched an offensive. They move and conquer positions. We know that the more Ukrainians are ready to release the land, the stronger they will be during the negotiations. And it is more likely that President Putin will realize that he will never win the invading war on the battlefield, ”Yinstoltenberg stressed.
On February 24, 2022, the large -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine replaced NATO on February 24, 2022. Alliance countries have begun to spend more on defense, strengthening security in the Euro -Atlantic region.
Even the share of 2% of GDP for defense, which was announced at the NATO summit in Walesiu in 2014 is not enough to effectively counteract modern threats, says Jens Stoltenberg. It was planned that by 2024 the countries would not spend a minimum of 2% on defense costs.
“We are preparing for the next NATO summit in Vilnius. There we will agree to increase and strengthen support for Ukraine, then strengthen our nuclear restraint and defense, which includes clearer obligations to increase defense costs.
I expect that the Alliance members agree that 2% of GDP should be a minimum and that the Mipovin is all investing in our defense and collective security, ”Yinstoltenberg summarized.

If you take, for example, one of the missiles that hit the Cryvyi Rih, then about 50 components in it - predominant -electronics - produced in other countries.
And today a meeting of representatives of our country with diplomats of corresponding countries took place. The list of companies that supply Russia for killer components has all partners. There is this list. The understanding of how Russian terrorist is deceiving the world is also in the world. And we are waiting for the conclusions of the fatty actions that will stop Russian rocket terror.It is definitely cheaper - once and for all to block the components for terrorists for terrorists for terror than to constantly spend new and new air defense tracks.
Today, there was a meeting on the preparation of the inevitable, legitimately fair responsibility of Russia for this aggression. We work out several X -molds for the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. The crime must be corresponded to the highest Russian leadership. A crime that is born other crimes of this war. And such responsibility will definitely be. In fact, this is not an easy task. But the Ukrainians have done so much difficult to do so that they will not only do it, but will be fulfilled with pleasure. The tribunal will be.
He met today with the CEO of IAEA Grossi. We are very active to prevent any incidents from the occupied Russian nuclear power plant. While the invaders are there, there is a risk for the world, and this is obvious. Only the complete de -occupation of the station and its return Podu -Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for that.
It is good that the IAEA proposes to send to us, to Ukraine, a group of experts, which appreciate the consequences of the destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. Sleeply to know in all the details of what is happening and what crime against the nature of the music was committed by Russia. I hope the IAEA experts will work in the near future.
And necessarily - our warriors, our characters. Thank you all who are in battle now, who protects and promotes our positions.
For example, the Bakhmut direction-which is, in particular, warriors of the 80th separate brigadidshv ... There is a forward movement in different areas. I thank you!Thank you for the extraordinary hardship!
The units of Tavriya dawn - in the conditions of extremely cruel battles, in the conditions of aviation and artillery advantage of the invaders there is a forward movement!Thank you, warriors!Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is released by the Edental Evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separately mechanized brigade, a 128th separate mountain-assault brigade, paratroopers of our seventystyevatyka, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". Thank you for your strength!
And thank you all in our society, who understands that the liberation of our land then requires difficult, heroic and intense actions that give the back, step by step the necessary power by our offensives!
Glory to Ukrainian heroes!Glory to all in the world who helps! Glory to Ukraine!

Представник штабу запевнив, що робота зі звільнення прикордонників іЗахисників Зміїного ведеться щоденно:
«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».
Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:
«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».
Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:
«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».
Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.
«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.
Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.
