This made the enemy the opportunity to remove a certain number of its parts, in order to intersect the Zaporozhye direction against our offensive group. They need to close this direction in buzzy.

Oleksandr Pavlyuk noted that the occupiers did everything to concentrate their most likely, in their opinion, the direction of the offensive of Ukrainian siloborov.

- I would not want to operate specific numbers or share the existing in the nosinformation, it is an offensive operation and she loves silence. After the Podrivkakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Russians were able to transfer certain units to Zaporizhzhya to counteract our group,-said Lieutenantolexander Pavlyuk.

- Currently, the enemy continues to strike with managed airbags. Along with the cymoblab, the frontline territory of the unpopular-Kamikadze of different types is being used. In any way, the Russians are used by "Shahda" to prevent them from beating from small arms, including large-caliber machine guns. Our mobile fire groups are already set by collimator sights, thermal imaging equipment, optics and conducters to effectively destroy such goals, - said the Sylvnny News Air Force Command Yuri Ignat.

He added that now the war is going into the automation stage. Complexes, Yakiris-T, Nasams, Patriot, have the opportunity to work in both manual and wavetous mode. Here, human intervention is minimal, and the automation itself has a short time deciding to destroy the goal.

- We have already successfully work such Western complexes as Gepard, which have proven themselves against both Shahmed rockets and winged missiles. This is anti -aircraft guns that shoot the ammunition and one hundred percentages, because they have a radar binding to it and have a radio. They can operate in the wave mode. The only thing - they have a small radius. We need them to place them in certain areas and protect the objects that are traveling to attack. At the same time, the French complex Croale is quite efficient in the destruction of both Shahaneda and rockets, - summed up Yuri Ignat.

The first patient who was performed in our country was a stable defender who lost both feet in the war.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/moz.ukr/posts/pfbid02wJgCUkF5Tf4A21L6xG9q9wnDgzfAJ3ZsHyY8YP8n7Q7VZK8RtrSD7gvCbZUgiwDAl)Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

Osteointegration is the latest technique for our country: during surgery, prosthesis is implanted directly into the bone. And after healing and recovery, the artificial foot is precipitate.

The first patient with osteintegrating prostheses was the 57-year-old captain of the Armed Forces Igorkronov. A man from the Dnieper. He is a Afghan veteran. In 2022, to voluntarily go to Ukraine. The extremities lost in the fall as a result of blasting the machine on a mini.

Now - more than six months after the loss of the limbs - the Ukrainian warrior already goes without a wheel chair. Wash and brushes his teeth, standing on artificial foams, walking and even steering the car.

The unbreakable defender shared the first impressions of walking on osteointere -giving prosthesis: “I go more and more confident and it is very pleased. Next - socialization, work, assistance of the front. Because the war is not over. It is very upset that many people have already ended. And you need to play long and get a nursing!”.

Currently, Igor Krupnova's rehabilitation is ongoing and he is engaged in physical therapists daily.

It should be noted that this recent technique has its restrictions:

* Excessive running and jumping are not recommended because the risk of bone fracture is very high; * Activation should be avoided that can increase the risk of infection. For example, bathing in swimming pools, lakes, ponds; * In the case of improperly exposed prosthesis axis, pain and other complications may occur.

Recall that in April this year Igor Krupnov [used](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/18/vijskovyj-stav-pershym-v-ukrayini-komu-implantuvaly-protez-v-kistku/)Implants.

Ukrainian representatives met with diplomats of these states, informed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the evening [video message](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6573), reports Ukrinform.

“Unfortunately, Russia is still able to receive critical components for production [missiles](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-raketa)which are created by companies of slim countries, including companies from some partner countries. These components are then supplied to Russia by different units. If we take, for example, one rocket that hit the crooked horn today, then about 50 components in it - mainly microelectronics - produced in other countries, ”he said.

_Vido: [Presidential Office, Telegrams](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6573)_

The President said that on Tuesday there was a meeting of representatives of Ukraine with reports of the respective states.

According to him, there is a list of companies that supply Russia's components for guns, and there is an understanding of how Russian terrorists try to deceive the world.

"We are waiting for conclusions and quick actions that will stop Russian rocket terror," Zelensky emphasized.

He recalled that Ukraine has applied for all companies in Russia, which is being issued rockets, emphasizing that such complete sanction restrictions should be at global level against all of them.

The head of state also insists that every way of bypassing sanctions should also be patronized at the global level and should be as exacerbated by exported control over critical components.

“If someone is a mediator or works with Russia to terrorist and continue to blow up dwellings and kill people, then such entities - business or state - deserve the reaction of the world. Hard reaction. There is information about this with partners. It is definitely cheaper - once to block the ways of supplying components for terror to terrorists, it is always possible to spend new and new air defense for aircraft, ”the President added.

On April 28, the European Commission agreed with the four neighboring countries of Ukraine - Bolgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - a package of measures that the mangiest after the mentioned countries have abolished their sole actions of anti -agrarian imports from Ukraine.

"We predicted the output of 80% of water from the Kakhovka reservoir. As of yesterday, more than 70% have already flowed. The problem is that there is a lot of water - 18 kilometers cubic, which is 7% of the total surface water runoff To influence the ecosystem of the Black Sea is a separate question.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-13T18-59-23-03-00/630_360_1599583101-141.jpg)The deputies of the European Parliament called on NATO Allies to provide Ukraine with a clear personality of membership during a summit in Vilnius in July.

This position was expressed by European politicians at the plenary session of the EP during the hearing on the humanitarian consequences and consequences for the environment for the destruction of the Gykhkhkhkhka, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We have to take decisive steps to a sustainable peace in Europe for the next guys. It requires even more courage than we have already demonstrated. Putin likes when he is afraid of the world. Fear prevented some union countries during a summit in Bucharest to provide a plan for membership for Ukraine. We now have a chance to correct our mistakes, ” - said a representative of the political group of the European People's Party Ras Yuknyavichen.

She reminded that their political group recently approved the drinking of Ukraine's membership in [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)immediately after the end of the war. According to her, this should be done from four causes. First, the preservation of "gray zones" of safety between the West and Russia is a constant voltage. Secondly, trained and equipped armed forces will be a significant added value for Europe. At the same time, Ukraine's integration to Euro-Atlantic structures guarantees a constant peace of Ukraine, and will prevent any attempts by Russia to be revealed to the intestinal and stop its imperial expansionism.

"" Don't be afraid, "said Pope John Paul II in the Soviet times. Ukrainian is not afraid. We also have no decisive steps today. Putin dictatorship has no power, because freedom is power, ”the Lithuanian deputation said.

In turn, the Polish representative Anna Fotiga stressed that undermining the Damikhov hydroelectric power station once again demonstrated the demonic face of the Russian Federation and the need for significant strengthening of assistance to Ukraine.

“We have to respond positively to the will of the Ukrainian people who want to join NATO and the EU, and do it as quickly as possible. Not only for their safety, it is important for the safety of all of us, ”the European Parliamentary.

Her compatriot Radoslav Sikorsky noted that the crime of the Russians in Novikakhovka should be included in the long list of accusations against the Russian Vladi during the International Tribunal. This crime denies any possibility of interruptions with Putin and is the best answer to those who offer them to resolve them.** Read also: ** [Duda: Summit ** NATO ** has to bring clear decisions of Ukraine's pursuit in the Alliance](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3722007-duda-samit-nato-mae-prinesti-citki-risenna-pro-clenstvo-ukraini-v-alansi.html)At the same time, Estonian MP Sven Mixer expressed the opinion that Ukraine's restoration will be long, and this issue cannot wait until the end of the war.

“This process should start now. Russia has to pay for all the damage it has been. Before that, we need to find the legal path how to use the frozen financial assets of the aggressor to partially cover the cost of these efforts. This does not distract us from providing Ukraine with military assistance, as during the time of contrast and the liberation of the occupied territories will grow ... eventually, we have to move quickly and decisively with European and Euro -Atlantic integration of Ukraine. This is the only way to guarantee both Ukrainian and Jewish security, ”the Estonian politician said.

MP Andrus Kublyus stressed that one of the factors why the war was agreed is that Europeans made a great geopolitical mistake for their years held Ukraine in the "gray zone" of European security, without a clear perspective on joining the EU or NATO. Because of this, Putin believed in the weakness of the urgreement and in his ability to capture Ukraine.

"It is time to correct our mistakes that have already cost Ukrainians of thousands of lives. Ukraine should get an invitation to join NATO during a summit in Vilniusii should become a member of the Alliance after the war. Ukraine needs to start negotiating for EU membership by the end of the year in order to complete them by the end of this decade. The teddy path to the sustainable peace we need all on the European continent, ”Kubilus said.

This was stated in the evening [video closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_96c_v3ifH0)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.

_Viso, [Presidential Office, Telegrams](https://t.me/OP_UA/9719)_

_ ** Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!** _

This afternoon rescue work and parsing in Kryvyi Cravishly, a rocket attack of terrorists were completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, among them di -evvitin ... My condolences to my relatives and loved ones. There are only more than 30 people injured. They are given the necessary help.

I want to thank everyone and everyone who participated in the rescue operation: SES rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, ordinary people. Thank you for every saved life!Thank you for every person whom they have been now.

This conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the prostitical one: we have to ensure that the Russian terror becomes impossible with our partners.

The first is our air shield. Sufficient number of air defense systems. Plus modern fighters. When the Russian ability to beat in our cities and villages is physically limited by our air shield, only then the terrorist-terrorist will understand that there will be alternatives for all Ukrainians and the loss for all Ukrainians and the loss for Russian.

The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of terrorist rockets by the state. Unfortunately, Russia is still able to obtain critical components for the production of missiles created by companies from around the world, such as companies from some partner countries. In different ways, these components are then supplemented in Russia. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit the Cryvyi Rih now, then about 50 components in it - predominant -electronics - produced in other countries.

And today a meeting of representatives of our country with diplomats of corresponding countries took place. The list of companies that supply Russia for killer components has all partners. There is this list. The understanding of how Russian terrorist is deceiving the world is also in the world. And we are waiting for the conclusions of the fatty actions that will stop Russian rocket terror.It is definitely cheaper - once and for all to block the components for terrorists for terrorists for terror than to constantly spend new and new air defense tracks.

Today, there was a meeting on the preparation of the inevitable, legitimately fair responsibility of Russia for this aggression. We work out several X -molds for the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. The crime must be corresponded to the highest Russian leadership. A crime that is born other crimes of this war. And such responsibility will definitely be. In fact, this is not an easy task. But the Ukrainians have done so much difficult to do so that they will not only do it, but will be fulfilled with pleasure. The tribunal will be.

He met today with the CEO of IAEA Grossi. We are very active to prevent any incidents from the occupied Russian nuclear power plant. While the invaders are there, there is a risk for the world, and this is obvious. Only the complete de -occupation of the station and its return Podu -Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for that.

It is good that the IAEA proposes to send to us, to Ukraine, a group of experts, which appreciate the consequences of the destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. Sleeply to know in all the details of what is happening and what crime against the nature of the music was committed by Russia. I hope the IAEA experts will work in the near future.

And necessarily - our warriors, our characters. Thank you all who are in battle now, who protects and promotes our positions.

For example, the Bakhmut direction-which is, in particular, warriors of the 80th separate brigadidshv ... There is a forward movement in different areas. I thank you!Thank you for the extraordinary hardship!

The units of Tavriya dawn - in the conditions of extremely cruel battles, in the conditions of aviation and artillery advantage of the invaders there is a forward movement!Thank you, warriors!Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is released by the Edental Evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separately mechanized brigade, a 128th separate mountain-assault brigade, paratroopers of our seventystyevatyka, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". Thank you for your strength!

And thank you all in our society, who understands that the liberation of our land then requires difficult, heroic and intense actions that give the back, step by step the necessary power by our offensives!

Glory to Ukrainian heroes!Glory to all in the world who helps!**_ Glory to Ukraine!_ **

3 The purpose of prevention of negative consequences for the human body should be careful monitoring of areas of soil damaged and contaminated as a result of hostilities, which will allow timely measures to be taken for their reflection and rehabilitation, as well as to set the boundaries of contaminated areas for more recovery.

About it during the roundtable "Earth, crippled by the war: how to restore the Solely after the fighting and catastrophe on the Kakhovsky hydroelectric power station?" In Military Media Centter, Deputy Director General of the Institute of Soil Security(Next is the Institute)Roman Palamarchuk:

- From the first months of the war we began to study in Zhytomyr, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions. In general, it is a beam for us, because we started to do the same for the first time. Only a part of the problem is currently made. Actual harm can only be calculated after the replacement of territories. For example, in the Kharkiv region, a plot of 44 ha, affected by nickel, zinc, copper, manganese iccobalt, whose content is 23 times the norm outweighs the area of 154 gabula. And our task is to detect such an immigrant in the future to decide what to do next: to remove from cultivation, to reclamation or to clean the biological method.

Prior to the war, the Institute was engaged in agrochemical certification and monitoring of the soil, which enables to compare and evaluate the damage caused and evaluated in the future. The experts of the institute studied world experience, took into account the American European achievements in this matter, which concerned primarily of military people.

- Based on the world experience, the best method of combating pollution is the definition of the problem, demining and further examination. And in times the appearance of chemical elements that will harm the human life, should be re -recultivation and conservation of the land. If the problem is not too serious: the borders of contamination are insignificant, then such a site can be removed to improve the land cover. But in the case of a significant territory, this plot will need more deeply studies and balanced decisions. For example, in the combustion sites of oil, petroleum products have been found 200 times, - said Roman Palamarchuk.

** Among the pollution removal methods there are now: **

At night, Russia committed another terrorist act-hit the territory of the Ukrainian and X-555 air base, released from the Caspian district. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Army of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, said in the Evil.

- In total, 14 rockets were released, 11 of which were destroyed. Unfortunately, we are not able to knock down all the missiles, as Ukraine is still lacking in the means of remedy. In order for our partners to accelerate the provision of both the complexes themselves and the missiles to them, and planes, which could also increase the percentage of air targets, the state leadership is constantly emphasized, - Yuri Ignat emphasized.

The officer emphasized that by their tactics the Russians try to exhaust the Ukrainian air defense:

-In some sections of the front, they launch drones-Kamikadze to spend relatively cheap air targets. In addition, in this way, they try to identify the location of our air defense products to adjust their actions and lay other marrows at the subsequent blows. At the same time, the question of the price of knocking down drones is not worth it, the main thing is to protect Ukrainian cities. But the rationality also needs to be thought-Puniter-Kamikadze is already on the approaches to the Ukrainian borders by those means that require less costs and which, first of all, should be more in our arms today.

Also, a spokesman for the Air Force Command stressed that Tehran did not stop the Shahhedov's "Shahanedov" resettles, and the leadership of the terrorist country announced the mass production of Dronov-Kamikadze Dronov.

- In contrast I note that we also have businesses that can produce percussion drones. In addition, we are assisted by partners with this weapon. We are growing our efforts in this regard. But, I repeat, and the means of protidius such goals need to be developed. These are small -scale small -scale weapons and electronic wrestling means that can affect such aircraft and missile vehicles, - said Yuri Ignat.

In addition, the officer stressed that modern aircraft-fighters can change the supply on the front line in favor of Ukraine.

- All our country expects from the next meeting of members of the contact group support of Ukraine in the format of Ramstein a positive decision to quidn the provision of aircraft - when it will be and how many aircraft, - added Ignat.

This was reported by Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in the Etheri of the Teleterna "Unin".

- Russia continues to develop the military industry, which has completely translated the Nariks of wartime. Now all its economy works for it. Therefore, of course, they also work on new types of weapons, - said Anna Malyar.

At the same time, according to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the Russians are prone to pre -propaganda exaggeration.

- During the war, one of the tasks of that propaganda is to influence the enemy, frightened by the power that is available. This is the main task of the information component of the war, - she emphasized.

Anna Malyar noted that during the year of a large -scale invasion of the Ukrainian community was far in the sense of critical thinking.

- Ukrainians should not frighten the amount of hostile information and its brightness, just as we are not frightened by the activity of the animal in the zoo cage. A Russian -talentar state that produces a lot of different content, but the question is whether this content reaches its goal. With regard to Russian misinformation, Ukrainian troops during hostilities or the release of Ukrainian earths, this in no way affects the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine!And a Ukrainian citizen should only believe in official sources and understand that Russian propaganda launches such messages in order to support the morale of the Occupation Yavsk. I emphasize that Russian sources can not be trusted, especially during the actualization of hostilities, such as now!Said Anna Malyar.

In addition, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized that, in the case of a plot into the information space and looking at the reaction of the Ukrainian military leadership, Russia is trying to obtain valuable information for it.

- The occupiers are not all good at intelligence in our territory. Therefore, it is not necessary to respond to such things. Unfortunately, the loss in the war is on both sides. The Alecity of Ukrainian losses does not correspond to the figure declared by the occupiers. Mipovin to perceive it as a provocation, no more. As for the international support of Ukraine: the quality of Russia's information machine is also aware of the West. This information is so toxic that no one needs to be convinced. Military professionals only use intelligence, - added Anna Malyar.

This was stated in the evening [video closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_96c_v3ifH0)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.

_ ** Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!** _

This afternoon rescue work and parsing in Kryvyi Cravishly, a rocket attack of terrorists were completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, among them di -evvitin ... My condolences to my relatives and loved ones. There are only more than 30 people injured. They are given the necessary help.

I want to thank everyone and everyone who participated in the rescue operation: SES rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, ordinary people. Thank you for every saved life!Thank you for every person whom they have been now.

This conscious Russian blow to the ordinary city only once again proves the prostitical one: we have to ensure that the Russian terror becomes impossible with our partners.

The first is our air shield. Sufficient number of air defense systems. Plus modern fighters. When the Russian ability to beat in our cities and villages is physically limited by our air shield, only then the terrorist-terrorist will understand that there will be alternatives for all Ukrainians and the loss for all Ukrainians and the loss for Russian.

The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of terrorist rockets by the state. Unfortunately, Russia is still able to obtain critical components for the production of missiles created by companies from around the world, such as companies from some partner countries. In different ways, these components are then supplemented in Russia. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit the Cryvyi Rih now, then about 50 components in it - predominant -electronics - produced in other countries.

And today a meeting of representatives of our country with diplomats of corresponding countries took place. The list of companies that supply Russia for killer components has all partners. There is this list. The understanding of how Russian terrorist is deceiving the world is also in the world. And we are waiting for the conclusions of the fatty actions that will stop Russian rocket terror.It is definitely cheaper - once and for all to block the components for terrorists for terrorists for terror than to constantly spend new and new air defense tracks.

Today, there was a meeting on the preparation of the inevitable, legitimately fair responsibility of Russia for this aggression. We work out several X -molds for the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. The crime must be corresponded to the highest Russian leadership. A crime that is born other crimes of this war. And such responsibility will definitely be. In fact, this is not an easy task. But the Ukrainians have done so much difficult to do so that they will not only do it, but will be fulfilled with pleasure. The tribunal will be.

He met today with the CEO of IAEA Grossi. We are very active to prevent any incidents from the occupied Russian nuclear power plant. While the invaders are there, there is a risk for the world, and this is obvious. Only the complete de -occupation of the station and its return Podu -Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for that.

It is good that the IAEA proposes to send to us, to Ukraine, a group of experts, which appreciate the consequences of the destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station. Sleeply to know in all the details of what is happening and what crime against the nature of the music was committed by Russia. I hope the IAEA experts will work in the near future.

And necessarily - our warriors, our characters. Thank you all who are in battle now, who protects and promotes our positions.

For example, the Bakhmut direction-which is, in particular, warriors of the 80th separate brigadidshv ... There is a forward movement in different areas. I thank you!Thank you for the extraordinary hardship!

The units of Tavriya dawn - in the conditions of extremely cruel battles, in the conditions of aviation and artillery advantage of the invaders there is a forward movement!Thank you, warriors!Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is released by the Edental Evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separately mechanized brigade, a 128th separate mountain-assault brigade, paratroopers of our seventystyevatyka, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". Thank you for your strength!

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-13T94-00-00-04-00/230613-sg-biden_rdax_775x440p.jpg)This was stated by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg during the announcement of joint statements with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken at the US State Department.

On June 12-13, a visit to Jes Stoltenberg to the United States was made, in which the leader of the novice Atlantic Alliance discussed in Washington the issue of the future summit in Vilnius.

NATO Secretary General has praised the support of allies on the Alliance to strengthen Ukraine's compliance in counteracting Russian aggression.

“I want to thank the United States and President Biden for everything you do to strengthen the transatlantic ties. And, of course, the support you perch Ukraine. European allies also contribute to Ukraine, tens of billions of economic and military support.

The support of NATO allies and partners is changing the situation on the battlefield as Ukrainian Ukrainians have launched an offensive. They move and conquer positions. We know that the more Ukrainians are ready to release the land, the stronger they will be during the negotiations. And it is more likely that President Putin will realize that he will never win the invading war on the battlefield, ”Yinstoltenberg stressed.

On February 24, 2022, the large -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine replaced NATO on February 24, 2022. Alliance countries have begun to spend more on defense, strengthening security in the Euro -Atlantic region.

Even the share of 2% of GDP for defense, which was announced at the NATO summit in Walesiu in 2014 is not enough to effectively counteract modern threats, says Jens Stoltenberg. It was planned that by 2024 the countries would not spend a minimum of 2% on defense costs.

“We are preparing for the next NATO summit in Vilnius. There we will agree to increase and strengthen support for Ukraine, then strengthen our nuclear restraint and defense, which includes clearer obligations to increase defense costs.

I expect that the Alliance members agree that 2% of GDP should be a minimum and that the Mipovin is all investing in our defense and collective security, ”Yinstoltenberg summarized.

About it [reports](https://t.me/Koord_shtab)Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.

Representatives of the coordination headquarters, the Office of the Verkhovna Rada for Human Rights, the State Border Guard Service of the Tamzhizh International Committee of the Red Cross were answered by the loved ones.(ICCH).

Представник штабу запевнив, що робота зі звільнення прикордонників іЗахисників Зміїного ведеться щоденно:

«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».

Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:

«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».

Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:

«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».

Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.

«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.

Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.
