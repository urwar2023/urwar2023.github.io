About this <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-169-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine-0">reported</a>On the IAEA site.</p>
<p>"Although the reconstruction of the power transmission line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear security and security on the facility," the Gross CEO Gross CEO.</p>
<p>Connection of the ZPP to a single power line 330 kilovolts(QV)Flewing from six such reserve lines to the conflict, 1 March was broken due to damage on the other bank of the Dnieper River and restored on the evening of July 1. Work on the restoration of the power line was complicated because of a complex security situation in the southern region.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important because in the last few months, the ZPP has relied on a single main line of 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor and other important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, there were four lines of 750 square meters.</p>
<p>Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup and ready -to -feed ZPP, if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.</p>
<p>During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.</p>

<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ </strong></p>
<p>He has just completed the conversation with Mr. French President Macron, and this is the third international negotiations for today-after talking to the Secretary-General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The main thing is our defense, front, weapons, the capabilities of our warriors, and I am grateful to partners for understanding our needs. We have argued for new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for something today, and weapons, which we agreed, started to come with something. , Rockets, tanks.</p>
<p>But, of course, they talked about more strategic things today - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.</p>
<p>In order for the world to come faster and be long, honest, true, Russian evil has to see what the Kremlin's ambitions are. It is we who are all free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.</p>
<p>We add the content of the NATO summit daily to take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the Alliance Strengthening, and therefore, for security in Europe, real security in Europe. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.</p>
<p>He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.</p>
<p>It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.</p>
<p>Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.</p>
<p>Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees, and it can not feel that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is exactly Russia. And no one else.To stop it is the duty of all in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.</p>
<p>I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people were injured, 12 of them were children, two are babies, they have less than a year ... Staff this time rescuers, together with police, still bypassing damaged buildings. Everyone who was injured in this rocket stroke will be provided with any necessary assistance.</p>
<p>And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.</p>
<p>Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life answers - fairly and inevitably - every terrorist is struck.</p>
<p>The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.</p>
<p>By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about new challenges to our security, a general situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...</p>
<p>We know how to put terrorists in place.</p>
<p>Thank you all our soldiers!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

Natalia Humeniuk, the head of the united News, reported this in the Emergency of the Unified News Telelorphone.</p>
<ul>
<li>During this day, the Russians fired at the Ukrainian authorities controlled by a temporarily occupied Kinburn Spit, thus trying to draw the attention of defense forces from the actions of the Russian units located along the Dnieper River, - the speaker said.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Humeniuk, the enemy is increasingly expanding the area of work of tactical aviation. Now, not only Beryslavsky, Ai Kherson district, the occupiers from the air have kissed twice from the Russian airplanes.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this way, Russian invaders are trying to avoid the concentration of the Ukrainian forces, - said the head of the united coordination press center of defense of southern Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humeniuk also reported that the artillery gunshots have recently intensified - the occupiers managed to return to the former positions, where the water had already drawn after the flood caused by the blast of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station.</p>
<p>According to the speaker, the invaders continue to distribute efforts along the front line, since they are aware that the maximum pressure from the Ukrainian units falls in the Zaporozhye direction - especially on land. In addition, Russian invaders actively use small sabotage groups on boats to learn about the ideas of Ukrainian units located on the left bank of the Dnieper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, almost daily in our reports there is information about the destruction of such families and groups of invaders. In total, 66 invaders, 2 puffs, 8 pieces of equipment and a hostile were knocked down over the Nikolaev area were damaged in this direction. It is the detection of intelligence drone that will recover the preparation of rocket and okola shocks by the occupiers.</li>

<p>According to him, there was still no case confirmation of double citizenship in a judge.</p>
<p>“By the way, this issue also has its complexity, because we cannot say that we are 100% reliable. It is difficult to obtain such data, since the diplomatic level does not provide for the state that provides a citizen of the citizen of Ukraine, reported the relevant bodies of our state. And if we turn to other diplomatic institutions, the states to answer this question, they will probably give it to the aggressor state, then we will not receive the answer, ”the head [GRP] said.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-visa-rada-pravosudda).</p>

<p>According to him, in order to change the procedure for the selection of judges, it is necessary to amend the dosacon “On Judiciary and Status of Judges”.</p>
<p>"It does not take much time, but it depends on how well the legislator will be presented, given the critical situation with the personnel in the judicial system," the GRP chairman emphasized.</p>

<p>“This is the position of our Western partners and the Parliamentary Committee on Law Policy. Absolutely everyone agrees that the year of study for a judge is a lot.

<p>He expressed this opinion in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3731742-grigorij-usik-golova-visoi-radi-pravosudda.html">interview Ukrinform.</a>“In fact, the issue of absence of disciplinary function in the High Council of Justice - is, that is, the implementation of judges on disciplinary complaints, is extended from August 2021. For almost two years, the High Council of Justice has not performed disciplinary function. During this time, more than 9 thousand complaints about judges have accumulated. The impossibility of the GRP to perform a disciplinary function, probably also contributing to the proceedings of situations where judges appear in corruption, ” - said Uusik.</p>
<p>He recalled that the GRP declared its willingness to consider disciplinary law on online meetings with members of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Legal Policy, which took place immediately after the formation(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-visa-rada-pravosudda)Usyk noted that the draft law on the first reading of the disciplinary function of the GRP in the first reading is that during the period of reconciliation of the disciplinary inspectors, the powers of the disciplinary inspector were transferred to a member of the Disciplinary Chamber.</p>

The Secretariat we gave an instruction earlier to inventory of all "disciplines" in order to track and analyze their resistance in the GRP, the severity of disciplinary misconduct, social intention, etc., to determine the priority of consideration, ”said the GRP chairman.</p>
<p>According to him, this work has already begun.</p>
<p>“About 1700 complaints are those who came to the GRP and were not considered until August 21, 2021. And the term of attraction that disciplinary responsibility is three years, ”Usik informed.</p>
<p>He also noted that there are currently no forecasts on the possible adoption of the bill on unblocking disciplinary function.According to him, it is proposed to create an independent competition commission with the participation of for three members of the GRP and three members recommended by international foreign organizations, which provide technical and legal assistance for the implementation of judicial reform in Ukraine for over three years.</p>
<p>This commission will hold a competition during the period of martial law on the postsciplinary inspectors, whose qualification requirements are also offered to change, added the GRP chairman.</p>

It seems to me that this change will increase the number of willing to these positions. The proposals for the first reading were drawn up in writing in writing, but their discussion, of course, is still delayed by the time of resolving the issue of "disciplines". Now it is even difficult for me to provide for the dramatic changes to this bill, as the committee will consider it after first reading. Because it is not about point amendments, but there is a significant change, ”the GRP chairman emphasized.</p>

<p>He stated that to take the Alliance in a state of war, although it is provoked by it, it is a red line for which NATO could not intercede because it would be the involvement of its countries in conflict.</p>
<p>"That is, it is a taboo. And it must be realized and not have unnecessary expectations," - it is noted.</p>
<p>According to him, European politicians take into account such an important factor as a social opinion.</p>
<p>"And politicians, leaders of democratic countries still look first and foremost, because they need to be elected. And they cannot come out with revolutionary proposals so that, for example, NATO would send their units or attract their own conflict. To turn against them, the Bosbal thought is not ready for such a scenario. And does not want to believe that this war can spread. There may be partially and naive desire, belief in what will end in Ukraine and this war will not spread further ", - explains the expert.</p>

<p>This opinion was expressed in an interview <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101785">Ukrainian radio</a>Eastern Europe expert, EU representation spokesman in Ukraine(2007-2019)David Strul, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>According to the expert, radical changes are already taking place in Russia, certain historical processes are ongoing - the collapse of the empire, a neolonial state, which began in the 1990s, and gradually Russia became less and less. In his thought, it is an irreversible process.</p>
<p>"This country has no future. There are no resources that would bring income to the budget. It seems to me that it is pre -szeroonic Aagonia of Russia. Now, when Europe and some other democratic countries cease to Russian oil and gas, there have been crazy problems in Russia. There is nothing to finance even their own state. And the elites, which are accustomed to sufficient financial support, to what could "deriban" the state budget, will now have nothing to deriban, and will begin international conflicts, "Stulik is convinced.</p>

This is due to the fear of power before the public changes and protests.</p>
<p>"Because it would mean that the Russians will simply demolish their power. That is, ceeteotic for the Russian leadership of the threat, but for Ukraine it is great shaft. The so -called Russian revolutions that took place in tsarist Russia, "Stulik said.</p>
<p>According to him, for Russia it is a very negative scenario. "When it can happen, it's hard to say. But I think it is worth considering it. Although we do not like it in the west, it's unpleasant, but it should also be reckoned with it," - said the Expert.</p>

That is, the Russians themselves are not directly, but mediated by the event that Russia can break up and can take a long way, " - notes Stlul.</p>

<p>Such data were published by experts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UkrainianIF/videos/1619640075197535">Ukrainian Institute of the Future</a> (IIF)During the presentation of the Ukrainian economy forecast for 2023-2024.</p>
<p>“According to our estimates, there are now about 28.5 million people in Ukraine. But not the common figure, but the structure. Among all these 28.5 million we have 16.8 million it is <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika">economically</a>Inactive population - pensioners, children. 11.7 million are economically active, but only 9-9.3 million work out of them. If you subtract this figure from the state employees, then there are 6-7 million people who, in fact, are the "harness" that brings the whole economy, " - said UIF economic programs Jan Lavryk.</p>
<p>She emphasized that the situation could further deteriorate. If the population is further emigrated, it will not be anyone to create GDP in Ukraine, pay taxes, and therefore - the country will not only be unable to serve the budget, but also to fulfill social obligations.</p>
<p>“Labor deficits will lead to taxes, because it is natural: if one working person will have two non -working ones to ensure them, you will have to increase the tax burden. Therefore, hence the economy of the economy, ”the researcher emphasized.</p>
<p>Therefore, in her opinion, the migration policy of Ukraine, namely the issue of Ukrainians from abroad and attracting new migrants, should be the number one priority for the regulation.</p>

<p>As it was reported, the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine considers that the termination, economic development and reconstruction of infrastructure and housing, as well as possible employment are the main factors that will contribute to the return of Ukrainians home.

The question of Tatya or not to go to fight was not even considered, because the man had combat experience, in 2014-2016-together with the brothers of the legendary part of the country's non-speech at the hottest points of East of Ukraine.</p>
<p>After receiving the team, the unit where Vitaliy is now serving, the task was put into one of the settlements of Donetsk region. It was not possible to take the city by storming the reactors, which is why hostile aviation tried every day to attack the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>enemy planes and helicopters did not fly without any fear, hanging in the air attacked the positions of brothers. We were surprised by such arrogance, but they did not know who was waiting for them here. Our erected battery clearly worked out the goals, - smiling the paratrooper. - Almost every day, every fighter made at least two -gaps. So in a month we not only "landed" sixteen goals, but also reflected the desire in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there was a Kharkiv operation ...</p>
<ul>
<li>My calculation was in the first echelon, along with the infantry, - continues Vitaliy. We were so close to the enemy that they even participated in the shooting battles and "stripping" of hostile positions. One day, we burst into the landing of the occupiers, we were entrenched in landing, through the field from the positions of the invasions. As soon as they noticed, as they noticed a couple of enemy aircraft. Immediately. Accimentation-enemy Su-25 is destroyed!And after a while, they saw the plane of fire and smoke falling a plane - these are guys from our calculation a little from other positions "landed" the next reads, - says Vitaliy.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Clerk"(space)(is our hero's call sign)(space)says that after hitting a rooted plane(uncomplicated)You do not have time to understand emotions from a successful "work", in the first place calculation, subordinate personnel.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to change the position quickly, to go to pre -prepared shelters, because immediately there is a "answer". I think how to save the lives of boys, and about emotions, about the amazed goals, then after victory!And it will certainly be!We are invincible, the nation of the heroes - on such an elevated note and proudly for the Ukrainians, our communication is the defender.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-05T88-00-00-04-00/malyar-ganna-1.jpg" />Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in the studio of the Teleterna "Unified News" was about the actions of the invaders in different directions and the situation around Zaporizhzhya Aese.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything that the Russians are doing now are aimed at turning the course of war. They use not only military remedies: they change, shoot, rockets launch, etc. Now they still use this panic of chizulating around the Zaporizhzhya NPP. It is also their instrument of war, which is trying to influence the course of the war, - said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>She noted that there are currently two main scenarios on the events of Nazaposhi NPP.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scenario is exclusively intimidation and blackmail. The second is a terrorist act. Both scenarios can be used by Russians to address their military tasks, - the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine informed.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to her, the occupiers often use the creation of certain panic platforms as a platform for carrying out information and psychological operations.</p>
<p>-First, the condition and mood among the population can affect the decision-making, especially when it comes to a democratic country. Secondly, cepsychological destabilization of both military-political leadership and everyone who takes teachers in this war, say, fighters at the front. After all, the latter are the targets for the Russian Federation during the implementation of information and psychological operations,-said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<p>She assured that Ukraine's defenders and defenders are preparing for all probable scenarios during this war.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the current situation, it is important to maintain calm, although we have already learned to cake. Only official sources of information should also be trusted, the advice of the painter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Returning to the events on the front, Anna Malyar reported that the Nabakhmut direction is now somewhat more active.According to her, in the Bakhmut direction, the enemy pulls up all his reserves in the same way to give up.</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not give up plans to reach the administrative of Donetsk and Lugansk region. Therefore, Bakhmut is very hot. Yes, lately, they have overcome their airborne troops. However, they also consider to go into battle. Therefore, the invaders are forced to exhibit "barrier reconnections". Such panic among them is the result of the successful work of our military, - said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the situation in the south, everything is also in our favor.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Tavria direction in some areas we have some progress. It is an argument, it is the biting of each meter of land, or, as the military says, is heavy work. First you need to exchange everything. Do not forget that constant shelling on the side of the enemy. Therefore, in such difficult conditions, although gradually, they move forward. The key result of all this is that we destroy the enemy and destroy his ability to promote the territory of Ukraine, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>She asked not to forget that the enemy in the south and the east has some advantage for weapons. That is, our army moves forward and in such complex conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The professionalism, motivation and courage of our military - all these factors did not take into account when carrying out their offensive. Also, unlike a lapel, we are more likely to make important decisions. Let me remind you that much of the standards have already been fulfilled by NATO. If we summarize, we are gradually, but we move forward. Instead, the enemy was not able to move in the enemy, where he tried to storm, he could not move, - finished Anna Malyar finally.</li>

<p>“If you came to your house killed one of your relatives. Raped one of your familiar people, burned your land, replaced the land so we could not grow a hatchyle, attacked us all winter with rockets. About 4 thousand racks flew to our heads, and this is a civilian population. I do not count those shells and missiles that are flying the military. They killed people, killed children and then you can restore relationships with these people and have a cure for this? ”, - asked the journalist Zelensky.</p>

About it <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/volodimir-zelenskij-pid-chas-spilkuvannya-z-universitetskoyu-84085">stated</a>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video conference with students and teaching staff of Buenos Aires and other Argentine universities.</p>
<p>About 400 students, heads of institutions, teaching staff, heads of foreign diplomatic representations, etc. took part in the online meeting.</p>
<p>“We have proposed the formula of peace and we want the companies to unite around it. Our military weapons displace the enemy, and politicians and social states can support us in various peaceful initiatives. We want Latin America to join to join Argentina. This is very important, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, answering students' questions.</p>
<p>The President emphasized that all points of the Ukrainian formula of peace are specific to overcome all those crises that Ukrainians have experienced or worried as a result of aggression of the Russian Federation<img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-05T94-00-00-04-00/461e1641c12d68eab9bf411d540bd8f6_1688575179_extra_large.jpeg" />“When we talk about nuclear security, it is not only because we are afraid of a felling at the Zaporozhye NPP, as it is a challenge not only for Ukraine but for the world. We all experience these crises, unfortunately, we share this tragic realization, and we have a decision on these points. But for this we need the union of the world around these problems, the political pressure on Russia and the decisions of these crises, ”he explained.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky also emphasized the need to join the state of Latin America to sanctions against Russia, until he has reached his reality and until the Russian Federation ceases to be aggression.</p>
<p>“The leadership of Russia should feel that it is isolated. They can not be accepted by the countries of the African continent, they cannot have business of Ferry America. It is impossible to press the hand of the leader of Russia, which is in the blood. Because he gave all these orders. And here, Latin America can take an active position, ”the president is convinced.“We didn't want this war. The Ukrainian people are passing through the test, and this is a great tragedy. Because war is only losses. But in order to not waste everything we have, we have to win. Therefore, we begin to be destroyed so that we are not destroyed. We did not enter the territory of Russia - they brought our homes, killed, raped children, ”the Head of State emphasized.</p>
<p>The President noted that the end of the war is the restoration of its territorial integrity and establishing justice by Ukraine by holding the reference of all guilty crimes.</p>
<p>"Parents who have lost children, children who lost their parents, men - women, women - their husbands, loved ones lost each other ... It is impossible to simply: that's all, we have finished, no one is shooting. The end of the war is religiousness. And first of all - the sentences of the killers. And that's when all this is built, then the war will end. We will be approaching this time. History shows that justice should be, the killers must sit for lattice, should be restored control of Ukraine over their land, the aggressor, as it was in many wars of the region, should admit that he is an aggressor, ”Vladimir Zelensky is convinced.</p>
<p>Speaking of relations with Argentina, he advocated the development of more closely.</p>
<p>“Ukraine can be a good partner in many areas, different areas. And it would be more to communicate, and that our governments would also work together, ”the head of state said.</p>
<p>The President also noted that Ukraine today is extremely important economic stability, and our country will welcome the steps of businessmen from all over the world, who are ready to invest in Ukraine and create jobs.</p>
<p>Turning to Argentine students, Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that every youth should spread the truth.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-05T94-00-00-04-00/91c1efe01e554cd6849d679d26c2d672_1688575177_extra_large.jpeg" />“It is important for us to maintain relationships between students, to communicate with people of your war, who are very interesting to you. Constant communication is important. And when you are not afraid of heart and not afraid, you can come and see what Ukraine is like. You will draw conclusions yourself, you will see the consequences of war on your society, ”the Head of State said.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his wishes for Ukraine to hear in Argentina and all Latin America.</p>
<p>“And I would very much like the leaders of your continent to give us more than more. I think our meeting would be very important, ”he said.</p>

<p>Such data were published by experts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UkrainianIF/videos/1619640075197535">Ukrainian Institute of the Future</a> (IIF)During the presentation of the Ukrainian economy forecast for 2023-2024.</p>
<p>“According to our estimates, there are now about 28.5 million people in Ukraine. But not the common figure, but the structure. Among all these 28.5 million we have 16.8 million it is <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika">economically</a>Inactive population - pensioners, children. 11.7 million are economically active, but only 9-9.3 million work out of them. If you subtract this figure from the state employees, then there are 6-7 million people who, in fact, are the "harness" that brings the whole economy, " - said UIF economic programs Jan Lavryk.</p>
<p>She emphasized that the situation could further deteriorate. If the population is further emigrated, it will not be anyone to create GDP in Ukraine, pay taxes, and therefore - the country will not only be unable to serve the budget, but also to fulfill social obligations.</p>
<p>“Labor deficits will lead to taxes, because it is natural: if one working person will have two non -working ones to ensure them, you will have to increase the tax burden. Therefore, hence the economy of the economy, ”the researcher emphasized.</p>
<p>Therefore, in her opinion, the migration policy of Ukraine, namely the issue of Ukrainians from abroad and attracting new migrants, should be the number one priority for the regulation.</p>

<p>As it was reported, the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine considers that the termination, economic development and reconstruction of infrastructure and housing, as well as possible employment are the main factors that will contribute to the return of Ukrainians home. And the return of our citizens is important for ensuring the rapid and sustainable economic restoration of Ukraine, because the aftermath of the need for labor resources will increase significantly.</p>
