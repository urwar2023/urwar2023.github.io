 For the first time in four months, the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was connected to a single -accessible backup transmission line, but the situation remains "extremely vulnerable" and unstable. About this reported On the IAEA site.
"Although the reconstruction of the power transmission line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear security and security on the facility," the Gross CEO Gross CEO.
Connection of the ZPP to a single power line 330 kilovolts(QV)Flewing from six such reserve lines to the conflict, 1 March was broken due to damage on the other bank of the Dnieper River and restored on the evening of July 1. Work on the restoration of the power line was complicated because of a complex security situation in the southern region.
The reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important because in the last few months, the ZPP has relied on a single main line of 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor and other important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, there were four lines of 750 square meters.
Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup and ready -to -feed ZPP, if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.
During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.

_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ 
He has just completed the conversation with Mr. French President Macron, and this is the third international negotiations for today-after talking to the Secretary-General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The main thing is our defense, front, weapons, the capabilities of our warriors, and I am grateful to partners for understanding our needs. We have argued for new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for something today, and weapons, which we agreed, started to come with something. , Rockets, tanks.
But, of course, they talked about more strategic things today - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.
In order for the world to come faster and be long, honest, true, Russian evil has to see what the Kremlin's ambitions are. It is we who are all free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.
We add the content of the NATO summit daily to take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the Alliance Strengthening, and therefore, for security in Europe, real security in Europe. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.
He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.
It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.
Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.
Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees, and it can not feel that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is exactly Russia. And no one else.To stop it is the duty of all in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.
I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.
One more.
Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people were injured, 12 of them were children, two are babies, they have less than a year ... Staff this time rescuers, together with police, still bypassing damaged buildings. Everyone who was injured in this rocket stroke will be provided with any necessary assistance.
And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.
Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life answers - fairly and inevitably - every terrorist is struck.
The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.
By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about new challenges to our security, a general situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...
We know how to put terrorists in place.
Thank you all our soldiers!
Glory to Ukraine!

It is difficult to obtain such data, since the diplomatic level does not provide for the state that provides a citizen of the citizen of Ukraine, reported the relevant bodies of our state.

 Ukraine seeks to increase the support of peace formula by Latin amarring states, including Argentina, since the formula points relate to the overcoming of all crisis caused by Russian aggression. About it stated President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video conference with students and teaching staff of Buenos Aires and other Argentine universities.
About 400 students, heads of institutions, teaching staff, heads of foreign diplomatic representations, etc. took part in the online meeting.
“We have proposed the formula of peace and we want the companies to unite around it. Our military weapons displace the enemy, and politicians and social states can support us in various peaceful initiatives. We want Latin America to join to join Argentina. This is very important, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, answering students' questions.
The President emphasized that all points of the Ukrainian formula of peace are specific to overcome all those crises that Ukrainians have experienced or worried as a result of aggression of the Russian Federation “When we talk about nuclear security, it is not only because we are afraid of a felling at the Zaporozhye NPP, as it is a challenge not only for Ukraine but for the world. We all experience these crises, unfortunately, we share this tragic realization, and we have a decision on these points. But for this we need the union of the world around these problems, the political pressure on Russia and the decisions of these crises, ”he explained.
Volodymyr Zelensky also emphasized the need to join the state of Latin America to sanctions against Russia, until he has reached his reality and until the Russian Federation ceases to be aggression.
“The leadership of Russia should feel that it is isolated. They can not be accepted by the countries of the African continent, they cannot have business of Ferry America. It is impossible to press the hand of the leader of Russia, which is in the blood. Because he gave all these orders. And here, Latin America can take an active position, ”the president is convinced.“We didn't want this war. The Ukrainian people are passing through the test, and this is a great tragedy. Because war is only losses. But in order to not waste everything we have, we have to win. Therefore, we begin to be destroyed so that we are not destroyed. We did not enter the territory of Russia - they brought our homes, killed, raped children, ”the Head of State emphasized.

"Parents who have lost children, children who lost their parents, men - women, women - their husbands, loved ones lost each other ... It is impossible to simply: that's all, we have finished, no one is shooting. The end of the war is religiousness. And first of all - the sentences of the killers. And that's when all this is built, then the war will end. We will be approaching this time. History shows that justice should be, the killers must sit for lattice, should be restored control of Ukraine over their land, the aggressor, as it was in many wars of the region, should admit that he is an aggressor, ”Vladimir Zelensky is convinced.

Turning to Argentine students, Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that every youth should spread the truth.
 “It is important for us to maintain relationships between students, to communicate with people of your war, who are very interesting to you. Constant communication is important. And when you are not afraid of heart and not afraid, you can come and see what Ukraine is like. You will draw conclusions yourself, you will see the consequences of war on your society, ”the Head of State said.
At the end of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his wishes for Ukraine to hear in Argentina and all Latin America.
“And I would very much like the leaders of your continent to give us more than more. I think our meeting would be very important, ”he said.
