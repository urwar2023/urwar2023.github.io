![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-04T12-00-00-04-00/zaes-1.jpg)For the first time in four months, the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was connected to a single -accessible backup transmission line, but the situation remains "extremely vulnerable" and unstable. About this [reported](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-169-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine-0)On the IAEA site.

"Although the reconstruction of the power transmission line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear security and security on the facility," the Gross CEO Gross CEO.

Connection of the ZPP to a single power line 330 kilovolts(QV)Flewing from six such reserve lines to the conflict, 1 March was broken due to damage on the other bank of the Dnieper River and restored on the evening of July 1. Work on the restoration of the power line was complicated because of a complex security situation in the southern region.

The reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important because in the last few months, the ZPP has relied on a single main line of 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor and other important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, there were four lines of 750 square meters.

Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup and ready -to -feed ZPP, if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.

During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ **

He has just completed the conversation with Mr. French President Macron, and this is the third international negotiations for today-after talking to the Secretary-General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The main thing is our defense, front, weapons, the capabilities of our warriors, and I am grateful to partners for understanding our needs. We have argued for new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for something today, and weapons, which we agreed, started to come with something. , Rockets, tanks.

But, of course, they talked about more strategic things today - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.

In order for the world to come faster and be long, honest, true, Russian evil has to see what the Kremlin's ambitions are. It is we who are all free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.

We add the content of the NATO summit daily to take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the Alliance Strengthening, and therefore, for security in Europe, real security in Europe. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.

He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.

It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.

Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.

Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees, and it can not feel that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is exactly Russia. And no one else.To stop it is the duty of all in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.

I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.

One more.

Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people were injured, 12 of them were children, two are babies, they have less than a year ... Staff this time rescuers, together with police, still bypassing damaged buildings. Everyone who was injured in this rocket stroke will be provided with any necessary assistance.

And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.

Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life answers - fairly and inevitably - every terrorist is struck.

The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.

By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about new challenges to our security, a general situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...

We know how to put terrorists in place.

Thank you all our soldiers!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has approved the relevant surveys and called on Russia to withdraw its troops from Moldova.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [News Maker](https://newsmaker.md/rus/novosti/obse-vpervye-predlozhila-zamenit-mirotvortsev-v-pridnestrove-na-grazhdanskuyu-missiyu/).

From June 30 to July 4 in Vancouver, Canada, the annual session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe took place([OSCE](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obse) ). На сесії ухвалили резолюцію проситуацію в Молдові.

"Уперше делегати закликали всі сторони розпочати політичні дискусії, щобзамінити нинішню миротворчу місію в придністровському регіоні набагатосторонню міжнародну цивільну місію", - йдеться в повідомленні.

Також члени Парламентської асамблеї ОБСЄ визнали, що конфлікт упридністровському регіоні Молдови, як і раніше, становить серйозну загрозубезпеці та стабільності в регіоні ОБСЄ.

Члени організації підтвердили свою прихильність досягненню мирного,всеосяжного і міцного розв'язання тривалого конфлікту за повної поваги досуверенітету, незалежності та територіальної цілісності Молдови в межах їїміжнародно визнаних кордонів.

About it in [interview Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3731742-grigorij-usik-golova-visoi-radi-pravosudda.html)The GRP Grigory Usik said.

In particular, he reported that the judges of the liquidated district administrative court of the city of Kyiv are currently in the status of judges, continue to hold the salary, but do not exercise justice.

“It is known from the State Judicial Administration that the Kyiv City Road Court will work in the premises used by the OASK. The following question is the determination of the number of judges by the High Council of Justice, which will work in the newly created court. We have previously discussed it at the meeting with the participation of the chairman and the representative of the DSAU.

"In any case, it is envisaged that this court should work until December this year," the GRP chairman said.

At the same time, he noted that he could not answer the question of what will be the procedure for the Kyiv City District Administrative Court, "because it is nowhere to be laid out."

"There may be transfer to this court of judges who have already undergone qualifying from other district courts," the chairman [GRP] suggests(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-visa-rada-pravosudda).

According to Usik, judges "can also be submitted for transfer, but in relation to, it is probably a corresponding check."

“I do not have a clear answer who will hold it. This procedure should be prescribed in the law. There will be no questions then. In any case, I think that the OASK will not get to the newly created court without a corresponding verification, for God none of them has passed a qualifying assessment, and without it they cannot be transferred to another court. Therefore, the fears that will be automatically transferred to the new court are in vain, ”the GRP chairman emphasized.As it was reported, on December 13, 2022, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law of calculation of the district administrative court of the city of Kyiv and the formation of the city city district administrative court.

This was reported by the head of the GRP Grigory Usyk in [interview with Ukrinform.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3731742-grigorij-usik-golova-visoi-radi-pravosudda.html)Answering questions regarding cooperation with law enforcement agencies about judges' devices, Usik said: "They only cooperated with the Security Service of Ukraine, which provides us with information about the presence or absence of other country's judges when considering his resignation."

According to him, there was still no case confirmation of double citizenship in a judge.

“By the way, this issue also has its complexity, because we cannot say that we are 100% reliable. It is difficult to obtain such data, since the diplomatic level does not provide for the state that provides a citizen of the citizen of Ukraine, reported the relevant bodies of our state. And if we turn to other diplomatic institutions, the states to answer this question, they will probably give it to the aggressor state, then we will not receive the answer, ”the head [GRP] said.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-visa-rada-pravosudda).

“There was information that it had a Russian passport, but it did not confirm the official sources of the Russian Federation. Therefore, we have difficulty in obtaining information about the existence of a judge of Russian citizenship. This is an objective factor related to the fact that the aggressor does not provide us with such data, ”Usik said.

He also stated that the changes in the selection of judges would be clear, and how quickly it depends on the work of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on the issues of legal policy by the Taboid Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine.In his opinion, "in the face of a shortage of judges, 12 months of training is a long time."

And although the CCSC, which is engaged in the selection of judges, is intended, it takes time for it to work filled, ”the GRP chairman said.

According to him, in order to change the procedure for the selection of judges, it is necessary to amend the dosacon “On Judiciary and Status of Judges”.

"It does not take much time, but it depends on how well the legislator will be presented, given the critical situation with the personnel in the judicial system," the GRP chairman emphasized.

At the same time, he emphasized that the topic of changing the selection of judges is "it is not just the intention of and talking in narrow circles."

“This is the position of our Western partners and the Parliamentary Committee on Law Policy. Absolutely everyone agrees that the year of study for a judge is a lot. Therefore, changes in the selection of judges will definitely be. And how quickly it depends on our joint work with the Verkhovna Rada Committee on the issues of legal policy of the CCCS. As far as I understand the speech of the CCCS chairman, the commission is now concentrated with the completion of the initial qualification assessment and the procedure of inspections - five years, - said Usyk.

The pond, as always, examined in detail the key directions of the East and South. Thank you, warriors, for your courage!

It is very important: at each meeting, the rates are returned again and again to be interrogated, in particular for our artillery. And this applies not only to the supply from partners, but also to production in Ukraine. I thank everyone and everyone who works for the sake of this strategic, vital assignment. There is a constant progress in the production of weapons in Ukraine.

The second is important that was today. We are preparing new sanctions, sanctions of our state, and today held a meeting on this with the first Viceremier-Minister and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Danilov. The decision is soon.

Third: he held a separate meeting on the situation with shelters in different areas of our state, in different cities. The Minister of Strategpromy Kamyshin, a profile of office head on the regional policy of Kuleb, reported.

Unfortunately, in different cities of Ukraine there is still a significant unwillingness of shelters… the afternoon. The state will not tolerate such inaction. And this is the responsibility of local executives. There is a resource in local authorities in the country for shelter.

One more.

It remains exactly a week until the key day of the NATO summit in Vilnius. So, the week is up to our joint security in Europe. We work with partners as much as possible to win our joint security in Vilnius. It depends on partners._**Glory to Ukraine!** _

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-05T20-08-26-03-00/630_360_1688576633-344.jpg)The world is now witnessing the death agony of Russia, at the same time, the Russian Federation itself is frightening the Westerm of its disintegration.

This opinion was expressed in an interview [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101785)Eastern Europe expert, EU representation spokesman in Ukraine(2007-2019)David Strul, reports Ukrinform.

According to the expert, radical changes are already taking place in Russia, certain historical processes are ongoing - the collapse of the empire, a neolonial state, which began in the 1990s, and gradually Russia became less and less. In his thought, it is an irreversible process.

"This country has no future. There are no resources that would bring income to the budget. It seems to me that it is pre -szeroonic Aagonia of Russia. Now, when Europe and some other democratic countries cease to Russian oil and gas, there have been crazy problems in Russia. There is nothing to finance even their own state. And the elites, which are accustomed to sufficient financial support, to what could "deriban" the state budget, will now have nothing to deriban, and will begin international conflicts, "Stulik is convinced.

This is due to the fear of power before the public changes and protests.

"Because it would mean that the Russians will simply demolish their power. That is, ceeteotic for the Russian leadership of the threat, but for Ukraine it is great shaft. The so -called Russian revolutions that took place in tsarist Russia, "Stulik said.

According to him, for Russia it is a very negative scenario. "When it can happen, it's hard to say. But I think it is worth considering it. Although we do not like it in the west, it's unpleasant, but it should also be reckoned with it," - said the Expert.

"This is what the Russians are accelerated through the so -called psychological information operations. That is, they make in advance so that the West is afraid to go the backstage, because Russia is quiet, through its" fifth column "suggests that the consequences will be negative.(The collapse of Russia - ed.)Allegedly chaos, it seems like additional in Russia, it is an even more refugee in European countries inevitability that will be with nuclear weapons of the Russian Federation. That is, the Russians themselves are not directly, but mediated by the event that Russia can break up and can take a long way, " - notes Stlul.

However, he disagrees with that. "The priority task is to win Russia. And it is next, let the Russians decide themselves," the expert is convinced.

“According to our estimates, there are now about 28.5 million people in Ukraine. But not the common figure, but the structure. Among all these 28.5 million we have 16.8 million it is [economically](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika)Inactive population - pensioners, children. 11.7 million are economically active, but only 9-9.3 million work out of them. If you subtract this figure from the state employees, then there are 6-7 million people who, in fact, are the "harness" that brings the whole economy, " - said UIF economic programs Jan Lavryk.

She emphasized that the situation could further deteriorate. If the population is further emigrated, it will not be anyone to create GDP in Ukraine, pay taxes, and therefore - the country will not only be unable to serve the budget, but also to fulfill social obligations.

“Labor deficits will lead to taxes, because it is natural: if one working person will have two non -working ones to ensure them, you will have to increase the tax burden. Therefore, hence the economy of the economy, ”the researcher emphasized.

Therefore, in her opinion, the migration policy of Ukraine, namely the issue of Ukrainians from abroad and attracting new migrants, should be the number one priority for the regulation.

The question of Tatya or not to go to fight was not even considered, because the man had combat experience, in 2014-2016-together with the brothers of the legendary part of the country's non-speech at the hottest points of East of Ukraine.

After receiving the team, the unit where Vitaliy is now serving, the task was put into one of the settlements of Donetsk region. It was not possible to take the city by storming the reactors, which is why hostile aviation tried every day to attack the air.

- enemy planes and helicopters did not fly without any fear, hanging in the air attacked the positions of brothers. We were surprised by such arrogance, but they did not know who was waiting for them here. Our erected battery clearly worked out the goals, - smiling the paratrooper. - Almost every day, every fighter made at least two -gaps. So in a month we not only "landed" sixteen goals, but also reflected the desire in general.

And then there was a Kharkiv operation ...

- My calculation was in the first echelon, along with the infantry, - continues Vitaliy. We were so close to the enemy that they even participated in the shooting battles and "stripping" of hostile positions. One day, we burst into the landing of the occupiers, we were entrenched in landing, through the field from the positions of the invasions. As soon as they noticed, as they noticed a couple of enemy aircraft. Immediately. Accimentation-enemy Su-25 is destroyed!And after a while, they saw the plane of fire and smoke falling a plane - these are guys from our calculation a little from other positions "landed" the next reads, - says Vitaliy.

"Clerk"(space)(is our hero's call sign)(space)says that after hitting a rooted plane(uncomplicated)You do not have time to understand emotions from a successful "work", in the first place calculation, subordinate personnel.

- It is necessary to change the position quickly, to go to pre -prepared shelters, because immediately there is a "answer". I think how to save the lives of boys, and about emotions, about the amazed goals, then after victory!And it will certainly be!We are invincible, the nation of the heroes - on such an elevated note and proudly for the Ukrainians, our communication is the defender.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-05T88-00-00-04-00/malyar-ganna-1.jpg)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in the studio of the Teleterna "Unified News" was about the actions of the invaders in different directions and the situation around Zaporizhzhya Aese.

- Everything that the Russians are doing now are aimed at turning the course of war. They use not only military remedies: they change, shoot, rockets launch, etc. Now they still use this panic of chizulating around the Zaporizhzhya NPP. It is also their instrument of war, which is trying to influence the course of the war, - said Anna Malyar.

She noted that there are currently two main scenarios on the events of Nazaposhi NPP.

- The first scenario is exclusively intimidation and blackmail. The second is a terrorist act. Both scenarios can be used by Russians to address their military tasks, - the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine informed.

According to her, the occupiers often use the creation of certain panic platforms as a platform for carrying out information and psychological operations.

-First, the condition and mood among the population can affect the decision-making, especially when it comes to a democratic country. Secondly, cepsychological destabilization of both military-political leadership and everyone who takes teachers in this war, say, fighters at the front. After all, the latter are the targets for the Russian Federation during the implementation of information and psychological operations,-said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

She assured that Ukraine's defenders and defenders are preparing for all probable scenarios during this war.

- In the current situation, it is important to maintain calm, although we have already learned to cake. Only official sources of information should also be trusted, the advice of the painter.

Returning to the events on the front, Anna Malyar reported that the Nabakhmut direction is now somewhat more active.According to her, in the Bakhmut direction, the enemy pulls up all his reserves in the same way to give up.

- They do not give up plans to reach the administrative of Donetsk and Lugansk region. Therefore, Bakhmut is very hot. Yes, lately, they have overcome their airborne troops. However, they also consider to go into battle. Therefore, the invaders are forced to exhibit "barrier reconnections". Such panic among them is the result of the successful work of our military, - said Anna Malyar.

As for the situation in the south, everything is also in our favor.

- In the Tavria direction in some areas we have some progress. It is an argument, it is the biting of each meter of land, or, as the military says, is heavy work. First you need to exchange everything. Do not forget that constant shelling on the side of the enemy. Therefore, in such difficult conditions, although gradually, they move forward. The key result of all this is that we destroy the enemy and destroy his ability to promote the territory of Ukraine, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

She asked not to forget that the enemy in the south and the east has some advantage for weapons. That is, our army moves forward and in such complex conditions.

- The professionalism, motivation and courage of our military - all these factors did not take into account when carrying out their offensive. Also, unlike a lapel, we are more likely to make important decisions. Let me remind you that much of the standards have already been fulfilled by NATO. If we summarize, we are gradually, but we move forward. Instead, the enemy was not able to move in the enemy, where he tried to storm, he could not move, - finished Anna Malyar finally.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this when appealing to the students of the argentina, answering questions when it is possible to restore relations between the Russian Federation.

“If you came to your house killed one of your relatives. Raped one of your familiar people, burned your land, replaced the land so we could not grow a hatchyle, attacked us all winter with rockets. About 4 thousand racks flew to our heads, and this is a civilian population. I do not count those shells and missiles that are flying the military. They killed people, killed children and then you can restore relationships with these people and have a cure for this? ”, - asked the journalist Zelensky.

Report for this day.

The first is the rate - especially long, especially detailed meeting. In particular, our strategic objects, our nuclear power plants. There were appropriate reports, relevant decisions and - very important - control over the implementation of decisions.

By the way, we are in contact with partners as much as possible so that no one has even the slightest shortage of information on the situation in the Zaporozhye Eesta created by Russia.

The pond, as always, examined in detail the key directions of the East and South. Thank you, warriors, for your courage!

We also keep attention in the northern direction - we see all potential threats, and the head is instructed to continue the strengthening of the North.

It is very important: at each meeting, the rates are returned again and again to be interrogated, in particular for our artillery. And this applies not only to the supply from partners, but also to production in Ukraine. I thank everyone and everyone who works for the sake of this strategic, vital assignment. There is a constant progress in the production of weapons in Ukraine.

The second is important that was today. We are preparing new sanctions, the sanctions of our state, and today he held a meeting on this with the first Vice Prime Minister-Ministry and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Danilov. The decision is soon.

Third: he held a separate meeting on the situation with shelters in different areas of our state, in different cities. The **** Strategpromy Kamyshin, a profile deputy head of the office on Kuleb regional policy, reported.

Unfortunately, in different cities of Ukraine there is still a significant unwillingness of shelters… the afternoon. The state will not tolerate such inaction. And this is the responsibility of local executives. There is a resource in local authorities in the country for shelter.

One more.

About 400 students, heads of institutions, teaching staff, heads of foreign diplomatic representations, etc. took part in the online meeting.

“We have proposed the formula of peace and we want the companies to unite around it. Our military weapons displace the enemy, and politicians and social states can support us in various peaceful initiatives. We want Latin America to join to join Argentina. This is very important, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, answering students' questions.

The President emphasized that all points of the Ukrainian formula of peace are specific to overcome all those crises that Ukrainians have experienced or worried as a result of aggression of the Russian Federation![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-05T94-00-00-04-00/461e1641c12d68eab9bf411d540bd8f6_1688575179_extra_large.jpeg)“When we talk about nuclear security, it is not only because we are afraid of a felling at the Zaporozhye NPP, as it is a challenge not only for Ukraine but for the world. We all experience these crises, unfortunately, we share this tragic realization, and we have a decision on these points. But for this we need the union of the world around these problems, the political pressure on Russia and the decisions of these crises, ”he explained.

And here, Latin America can take an active position, ”the president is convinced.“We didn't want this war. The Ukrainian people are passing through the test, and this is a great tragedy. Because war is only losses. But in order to not waste everything we have, we have to win. Therefore, we begin to be destroyed so that we are not destroyed. We did not enter the territory of Russia - they brought our homes, killed, raped children, ”the Head of State emphasized.

It is impossible to simply: that's all, we have finished, no one is shooting. The end of the war is religiousness. And first of all - the sentences of the killers. And that's when all this is built, then the war will end. We will be approaching this time. History shows that justice should be, the killers must sit for lattice, should be restored control of Ukraine over their land, the aggressor, as it was in many wars of the region, should admit that he is an aggressor, ”Vladimir Zelensky is convinced.

Such data were published by experts [Ukrainian Institute of the Future](https://www.facebook.com/UkrainianIF/videos/1619640075197535) (IIF)During the presentation of the Ukrainian economy forecast for 2023-2024.

“According to our estimates, there are now about 28.5 million people in Ukraine. But not the common figure, but the structure. Among all these 28.5 million we have 16.8 million it is [economically](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika)Inactive population - pensioners, children. 11.7 million are economically active, but only 9-9.3 million work out of them. If you subtract this figure from the state employees, then there are 6-7 million people who, in fact, are the "harness" that brings the whole economy, " - said UIF economic programs Jan Lavryk.

She emphasized that the situation could further deteriorate. If the population is further emigrated, it will not be anyone to create GDP in Ukraine, pay taxes, and therefore - the country will not only be unable to serve the budget, but also to fulfill social obligations.

“Labor deficits will lead to taxes, because it is natural: if one working person will have two non -working ones to ensure them, you will have to increase the tax burden. Therefore, hence the economy of the economy, ”the researcher emphasized.

Therefore, in her opinion, the migration policy of Ukraine, namely the issue of Ukrainians from abroad and attracting new migrants, should be the number one priority for the regulation.

As it was reported, the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine considers that the termination, economic development and reconstruction of infrastructure and housing, as well as possible employment are the main factors that will contribute to the return of Ukrainians home. And the return of our citizens is important for ensuring the rapid and sustainable economic restoration of Ukraine, because the aftermath of the need for labor resources will increase significantly.
