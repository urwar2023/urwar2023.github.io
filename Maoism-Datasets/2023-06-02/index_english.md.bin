She tries to submit to the Russian inhabitant a "delay" with his premium as evidence of the weakness of the enemy and the indomitability of the positions of own army, [reports](https://www.facebook.com/protydiyadezinformatsiyi.cpd/posts/pfbid0yNaoJjcAon1yTXCZDZ9JBFkvx2VFWED9nA5xAo1CtNQ1oTTjdAijTotcg9ukMJ74l)The Center for Combating Misinformation on Facebook Page.

The propagandists began a real information attack, seeking to prove the Russian audience hypertrophied information about the final "bleeding" of Ukrainians and the same voiceful statements about the effective destruction of Western equipment.

Information preparation of the Russians for the future offensive of the Armed Forces provides for the subsequent theses in their consciousness.

** First, the ** The Ukrainian army allegedly has no counter-offensive, and the statements of the gap-nothing more than a "reception" for "asking" new supplies of Western. In order to give "authority" propaganda actively manipulates the estimates of the "former US Navy officer, Professor of the School of Public Tamzhnaya International Relations of Georgia University Colonel James". In publications of the Propaganda media(lenta.ru)The reference to this "expert" states that "Ukrainian leaders use the future offensive as weigh to support the supply of Western weapons." In fact, the expert does not exist, and the links are taken to Dr. James Holmes blog(really a former US Navy officer), which does not contain assessments of the Armed Forces, but only the Ukrainian counter -offensive has already begun.** Third, ** is moving as an indisputable thesis that Russia allegedly successfully reduces the equipment of the Armed Forces both in combat positions and on the path of its supply, as a result of which the Ukrainian army simply does not have enough heavy arms for offensive actions. However, objective confirmations of this word, and the data of the Oryx portal, which calculates only photo fixations of losses of equipment, show - in daily mode more heavy weapons lose the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The British intelligence believes that the Russian command tries to form the reserve forces and place them where, in their opinion, the Ukrainian counter -offensive can be able to resolve. But this prevents the need to throw reserves on the front line in Bakhmut and the border areas of the Bryansk and Bryansk regions after Ukrainian operations in the "gray zone". Incarnation to falling discipline in its benches.

It all testifies that the Kremlin recognizes the success of the Ukrainian contrast and tries to mitigate the demoralization of Russian society with the introduction of the fall of the authorities, as it was after the military failures of the RFN Kherson and Kharkiv region.

However, despite the manipulative "tricks", the topic of discrediting the Ukrainian contrast remains a weak link in Russian propaganda. Independent information on the Internet, which the Russians are increasingly trusting, proving notes opposite to the official Kremlin narratives. Namely - the agenda of the game at the front is actually dictated by Ukraine, and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are only passively resort to that the enemy will not reserve on the counterattack. Even the most aggressive propagandists do not risk proving the ability of the Russian Army to only new breakthroughs, but also to the maintenance of already occupied Ukrainian territories. The threats of the Russian General and individual warriors to defeat the Ukrainian counter -offensive look as a mockery of themselves against themselves in the past year near Kiev, Kharkov and Kherson. Even the leader of the Wagnerians is. Prigogine, commenting on the desire of Russian propaganda to increase the successes of the Russian Army and humiliate the combat qualities of the Armed Forces, called such a recipe for defeat, and acknowledged that "the Ukrainian army is preparing and showing quite good results."

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T92-00-00-04-00/volodyayaya.png)This long and hard day is being completed.

First of all, my condolences to the relatives and relatives of whose lives were taken away by Russia.

We do the maximum to protect people. There was no such international meeting, there were no such international negotiations that would not raise the issue of the issue of Ukraine.

But protection of people is protection at all levels. The shelter should be available. The situation should no longer happen again as this night in Kiev, when people came to the shelter and the shelter is closed. It is a duty of local departments, a very specific duty - to ensure the availability and availability of plates around the clock. It hurts to see a negligent attitude to this duty. It seems to see losses. And if the duty on the ground is not fulfilled, it is a direct obligation to law enforcement officers - to be held liable.

Today in our country, as in many other countries, there is a day of protection of children. But on this day, the terrorist state claimed the life of the Ukrainian child. But on this day, Russia fired at our cities - from Kharkiv Daherson, from Kiev to Donbass. But we also used this day to the maximum to be defeated by terrorists. And this day became a time when we bring the responsibility of Russia - every murderer, every terrorist.

Our Ukrainian delegation - in Moldova at the Summit -European Political Community. Now here is the Center for Political Discussions by the continent. There were very important negotiations. Moldova President of France, Prime Minister and the President of the European Commission, President of Romania and Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister Albania and Prime Minister of Northern Majoria, premiere of Italy, President of Azer, President of Swiss, President, President, President, President.

There was also an extended format with representatives of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Britain, Poland, Belgium. And, of course, meetings in the fields of the summit and jointly ascending all participants of the summit ...

We are preparing new defensive solutions for Ukraine - this applies to air defense and aviation, and other promotion on Earth. We are preparing a real political content for Natu Vilnius summit. We are preparing a security package for our country on the way of Valiance. We do our best to bring the political decision of the European Union on the Svetwan of Ukraine. We prepare the peace of peace based on the Ukrainian formula of peace.

And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us by these points. This only support for Ukraine is the support of real security for all of Europe.I would like to thank President Michelle, the President of the European Council, held a special security session within the summit.

And separately I would like to thank Roberti Motzoli, the head of the European Parliament, a weed decision on ammunition for Ukraine - with the support of the allocation of an additional 500 million euros for this. Thank you!

Thank you all our soldiers!Thank you all who train our warriors!Who helps weapons!Who treats our heroes after injuries!I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the SES and other services that eliminate the consequences of Russia!I thank all the volunteers who help our warriors, our bride, our country!

I thank everyone with whom we go side by side to our victory, to our peace and the help of Russian terrorists.

Anna Malyar said that it could be an example of a nervous reaction to other events. In the information space, the theme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was actively covered, and the Russians had a panic influence.

- Indeed in the east of our country, they tried to step from the New Year to 4 more - now they added 2 more, but nothing works. The Russians are constantly advised to give their tasks, for example, to get out on the turn of the Lugansk and Donetsk region, so the program they have set themselves after they did not realize Kiev, they could not implement, - said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

In addition, she added that the enemy is definitely looking for other paths to still be Ukraine and many of their steps are due to distorting a psychological equilibrium and demoralized.

As Ukrinform reports with reference to [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/international/4032050-us-wont-be-pulled-into-nuclear-arms-race-with-russia-china-sullivan/), Jake Sullivan, Presidential Advisor to the SSHAZ President, said at Washington at the annual conference of the Armed Forces Control Association.

"The United States does not need to increase nuclear forces and outperform our core competitors to successfully restrain them," he said. "We have already passed and learned this lesson." Instead, the US administration will focus on "advanced non -nuclear opportunities", such as hypersonic missiles with a conventional weapon that can reach "well -protected, highly valuable goals", Sullivan explained.

"Effective restraint means that we have a better approach," not the pursuit of the more, he said.

He criticized the Russian Federation, but that it "strikes the nuclear system after the Cold War" and also accused the Chinese government in the inability to demonstrate any openness of communication on weapons control.

As you know, the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia are close in size and have more than 5,000 weapons in each country(Although the Russian Federation is estimated to have slightly larger). Китай має близько 400 одиниць ядерної зброї, але планує нароститиарсенал до 1500 боєголовок.

This opinion was expressed in a comment by Ukrinform excluder of US Central Command in 2008-2010 and former CIA Director(2011-2012)General David Petreus, who during his visit to Ukraine performed the American Universities.  “Gerasimov(Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia - ed.)ruching(міністроборони РФ – ред.)They are looking for any opportunity to gain at least a more professional, qualified and well-equipped Ukrainian forces, ”said General Petreus.

In addition, he said, Russian special forces used as a light infantry, so these units lost their combat capabilities. Russian infantrymen were also not used for its intended purpose.

According to Petreus, this irreversibility, along with constant reddish commercials and the absence of large reserves, will lead to the newly formed Ukrainian brigades, equipped with Western tanks and combat vehicles, forces the Russian troops to "sprinkle" and will be likely to cause their "disruption".

The General added that the question is whether Ukraine will be able to drive a large part of the front, forcing the Russians to respond.

As soon as the defensive order of the Russians will stretch, it will open even more opportunities to promote the Ukrainian army, says Petreus.

"Припинення вогню без виконання цієї умови призведе до заморожування статус-кво, надасть Росії можливість перегрупуватися, накопичити сили та вдатися донової хвилі агресії.

Ба більше, щоденніросійські ракетні атаки та атаки дронами по українських містах доводять, що вМоскві не розглядають інших сценаріїв, окрім як продовжувати війну", -акцентував речник МЗС.

Водночас він зазначив, що українська сторона взяла до уваги твердження ВіктораОрбана про те, що йому важко бути "єдиним прем'єр-міністром в ЄС, якийвиступає за мир".

"Аби полегшити цю ситуацію, закликаємо главу угорського уряду почати нарештідіяти. Наприклад, засудити російську агресію, вимагати від Москви припинитивійну та повернути російську армію на російську територію, долучитися дозаходів міжнародної ізоляції Росії, не підривати єдність у ЄС", - зазначивНіколенко.

According to the current obligation, signed in 2014, the NATO Allies have increased the expenditures of up to 2% of GDP by 2024, and today only the aximizes 31 member countries have achieved this goal. According to Stoltenberg, the discussions are brushed.

Speaking of the 2014 agreement, the Secretary General noted that "we have a twenty -year perspective in Velsea, but it was ten years ago, we could not have a ten -year perspective."

The Alliance head also noted that NATO allies should sign more contractions with defense companies to increase the production of ammunition whose stocks are depleted.

According to him, the Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty was introduced by the defense industry to join the meeting of the Ministers of Defense in Brussels later this month.

The NATO Secretary General expressed hope that at the Vilnius summit in July, the Allies will be amazed about the Defense Industry Action Plan, which will describe how to increase production and jointly purchases, as well as ensure operational compatibility and standardization.

"So far, the Allies have exhausted the reserves to be able to support Ukraine - a central path, so we need to increase production to achieve more and more ambitious goals," Stoltenberg said.

Earlier, the Alliance Secretary General has stated that NATO and country allies should avoid the creation of new barriers in the defense industry to tailor tasks to increase weapons and ammunition.

Німецькі слідчі припускають, що причетні до підриву газопроводів особизафрахтували для нападу вітрильну яхту під назвою "Андромеда", яку використалидля переміщення з німецького Ростока до місця підриву газопроводів. Прифрахтуванні були використані підроблені документи. Серед іншого, були знайденіболгарські паспорти, які при перевірці виявилися фальшивими, та румунськийдокумент, також підроблений, але в якому були використані особисті даніреальної людини – Штефана М.

Відповідно до публікації в Der Spiegel, обшуки у Франкфурті-на-Одері проходилив будинку родичів цього "Штефана М.", і слідчі шукали підказки, чомузловмисники зупинилися саме на його особі.

Зазначається, що найвагомішим доказом використання "Андромеди" є те, що вкаюті яхти були знайдені сліди підводної вибухової речовини октогену. Якзазначає газета, у слідчих є зачіпки, що можливі виконавці підривугазопроводів могли бути з України, однак це також можуть бути спеціальнозроблені хибні зачіпки, щоб ввести слідство в оману.

Крім того, деякі експерти вказують на те, що для підриву газопроводівзнадобилося б стільки вибухівки, що для транспортування вибухівки на дноБалтійського моря знадобився б більший корабель, ніж "Андромеда", і, можливо,міні-підводний човен.

About it in [telegram](https://t.me/SBUkr/8538)The press service of the Security Service of Ukraine reported, Ukrinform reports.

“The Security Service of Ukraine and the Bureau of Economic Security exposed another large -scale sedimentation of money by the extract of PJSC“ Ukrtatnafta ”. The former member of the company's supervisory board and the Business partner of Kolomoisky Mikhail Kiperman are involved in the organization of Obrykka, ”the message reads.

According to the materials of the investigation, nearly 600 million in UAH equivalent was deduced from the accounts of Ukrtatnaftybul.

This was done on the first day of a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, probably calculating that the attackers will not have to be responsible for the theft.

The scheme was that on February 24, 2022 PJSC "[Ukrtatnafta](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukrtatnafta) » перерахувала на підконтрольнуєвропейську компанію майже 600 млн грн, які передбачалися іншому постачальникудля оплати раніше зафрахтованих 84 тисяч тонн сирої нафти.

Зазначається, що на момент махінації ця сировина уже перебувала в Одеськомупорту і мала бути доставлена для подальшої обробки на Кременчуцький НПЗ.

Для реалізації оборудки колишній топменеджмент Укртатнафти створив «договір-клон», в якому змінив реквізити отримувача платежу. Таким чином, організаторисхеми перевели гроші на підконтрольну компанію, замість того, щоброзрахуватись із реальним постачальником нафти.

_ ** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!** _

A brief report for this day.

The first - I staged. Urgent security issues. The obvious strict reaction of Nazagbel of people in Kiev through a closed shelter. There is an assignment about the inspection of protective structures in Kiev and all over the country. Responsible - Kamyshin Iklimenko ministers.

Unfortunately, today - after all - the people of Kiev again and again publish information about the inaccessibility of shelters. Not just about closed shelters, but about brewed in shelters, about the absence of shelters in general in some parts of the city. This level of negligence in the city is not covered with any excuses there.

They discussed all the details regarding our air defense - its further development, supply and production of the necessary missiles in Ukraine. The Ukrainian aerial board should be provided with everything you need on a constant basis. We are engaged in the Coalition of Petriots and a coalition of modern fighters - actively.

Very carefully - the situation on the front line, at all the points where the most rigid is now. I will not talk about it in more detail - the actions of our country, the active actions of our military will say what is needed. And separately he held a meeting on the preparation of new brigades, those who from the north to the south of our country accumulate power.

The second point for today - negotiated with the President of Estonia, who was in Kiev. First of all, safety is something that concerns our protection, as well as what is related to our safety long -term. Estonia helps us with weapons, technology, supports our NATO movement, generally understanding how important we are that we have victory over Rashism right now and on our Ukrainian land. This is important for every nation that is a terrorist state. I am sure that we will give this safety - so necessary, to Ukraine, to Ukraine, the whole of Europe and the free world victory over Russian aggression.And, by the way, I will make such an announcement: "Action" will help to develop state services and greetings, not only European - in Latin America and Africa.

The third is from different activities of this day, which is worth saying. The meeting of meetings, long and meaningful meetings, regarding the formation of our policy - complex - for the future. What is concerned with the further transformation of the state. What concerns our participation in global processes. As always, we prepare news and solutions that will give Ukraine and Ukrainians even more strength.

Thank you all who help our country!Glory to all our soldiers!Everyone who is now in battle for Ukraine.

I would like to point out today the 92nd separate mechanized brigade-the whole of this brigade, which extremely resistant to the Swatt Tavdalo reflecting enemy attacks, moving forward. Thank you, warriors!

The Avdiivsky direction ... The 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade-Thank you, the warriors, for your courage and your ability to powerfully destroy the occupiers. Well done!

I will note the border guards who have honored the state on the forefront of Zuzima with our defense and security forces. Lviv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr border guards that fight on the front. Thank you!And thank you to the fighters of the Chernyhiv border detachment, who are actively counteracted by Shahanedam. The speed and accuracy of our soldiers are critical.

As Ukrinform reports with reference to [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/international/4032050-us-wont-be-pulled-into-nuclear-arms-race-with-russia-china-sullivan/), Jake Sullivan, Presidential Advisor to the SSHAZ President, said at Washington at the annual conference of the Armed Forces Control Association.

"The United States does not need to increase nuclear forces and outperform our core competitors to successfully restrain them," he said. "We have already passed and learned this lesson." Instead, the US administration will focus on "advanced non -nuclear opportunities", such as hypersonic missiles with a conventional weapon that can reach "well -protected, highly valuable goals", Sullivan explained.

"Effective restraint means that we have a better approach," not the pursuit of the more, he said.

He criticized the Russian Federation, but that it "strikes the nuclear system after the Cold War" and also accused the Chinese government in the inability to demonstrate any openness of communication on weapons control.

As you know, the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia are close in size and have more than 5,000 weapons in each country(Although the Russian Federation is estimated to have slightly larger). Китай має близько 400 одиниць ядерної зброї, але планує нароститиарсенал до 1500 боєголовок.

Joint Coordination Center(SKC)In Istanbul, he announced the impossibility of drawing up an inspection plan for June 1 through another unreasonable rejection delegation to register an entrance fleet to participate in the initiative.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=630363709131814&set=a.290337743134414)Ministry of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.

Thus, within two days, May 30 and 31, Russia registered only 1 entrance vessel for the Inspectorate for the Inspectorate for the Inspectorate, while other SCCs confirmed 10 vessels for three -portions in the Black Sea initiative. The destructive position of Russia and the absence of registered vessels by the inspection makes it impossible to draw up an inspection plan for today, as all by the Medical Officers were notified by the Secretariat of the SKCC.

In the queue for inspection in Turkish territorial waters, 50 vessels are expected, and 2.4 million tons of food for the world should be loaded. It is almost a twentieth volume than it was exported in May. Some vessels expect the Inspectorate of the SKCC for more than 3 months. This is over $ 1 billion in losses that are placed on the final cost of food for the world. Thus, Russia once again found a way to limit the world in food. The blocking of registration of the new incoming fleet, as well as the blocking of the largest port "Southern", is a gross violation of the conditions of the grain initiative, under which the aggressor country has signed.

Ukrainian inspectors are currently in the SKCTA ready to get to work immediately in case of registration of ship registration.

We hope that the initiative partners will still find the decision and get this blackmail of Russia around the world. After all, the importance of the grain initiative is drawn to the global food market and the world should not be silent.

We will remind that in 10 months of work of grain initiative more than 30.5 million tons of products of Ukrainian farmers have been exported. Seven months continued to grow and inhibit work by the Russian delegation in the SKCC, as a result of the world, at least 20 million tons of food have not received.

Russian troops made another blow to Ukraine on the night of June 2, using winged missiles and drones. The epicenter of the night attack was again our capital. Over the past six days, this is a sixth blow to Kiev. Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat reported about this air of the only news.

- According to preliminary information, all the goals were shot, we worked successfully, - said Yuri Ignat. - The attack was combined. Currently, we clarify the information of rockets and drones. It is about 15 rockets and 21 blockages. The rocket launchers were made of strategic Tu-95MC bombers of the Caspian Zrimea, the drones were flying from the south. It is obvious that it is impossible to call the approach of the Russians of fine attacks systemic, they try to act atypically, to attack at a time when, in their opinion, we do not expect it. Thanks to the new air defense systems, we even knock down missiles flying in the ballistic trajectory. However, once again I emphasize that in the case of air alarm, you need to take care of your safety more quickly, - the spokesman said.

According to the results of this study of the CPD, the enemy concentrates propaganda efforts on the promotion of three main narratives, namely:

* "Paradise" for children is Russia "; * "Ukraine is indifferent to its own children"; * "The West uses children for their own purposes."

Disinformation campaigns using the topic of deported Ukrainian children are:

1. demonization of the security and defense forces of Ukraine; 2. discredited military-political leadership of Ukraine; 3. Creating a negative idea of Ukraine in the world community.

To achieve its goals, Russia uses a wide set of tools to develop propaganda, using its diplomatic missions in particular.

The General Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reminds that every military crime established by the Russians will not be left without a fair punishment.

The organizers of the event were the National Unions of Artists of Ukraine and the Department of Humanitarian Support of the MOU. Such a characteristic and non -standard treatment for the military in the medical establishment was used for the first time.

- In this case, art therapy is unique in that the artist and the warrior in the symbios are a joint work. First of all, it is the psychological rehabilitation of military thae efficient adaptation to civilian life outside the war zone. The fights will convey their feelings from the experience, and the artists in their turn complement the creative products. This has not yet been in our practice, so we will be able to promote such equipment throughout Ukraine, and in this hospital we will hold this action monthly, - says the organizer of the event, doctoral art, Professor Alexei Rogotchenko.

The layout of the easel with clean canvases, the tunes of the harp, the green glade, surrounded by trees - all this created comfort and peace. The theme for drawing for everyone was one - to show how you see the Dawn of Victory.

Without thinking for a long time, the soldiers got to work, and they help them in this qualified artists. Everyone decided on their style of writing: someone was amazed, someone chose an abstraction, and some decided to draw a landscape ... Interestingly, every one of the military personnel attended today has not tried himself in the role. And now they depict their emotions on the canvas.

The boys have time to manage it as "the most important expert in art." With a brush in the teeth, she evaluated everyone's work.

The psychiatrist Inna Chernenko says that the picture can determine the emotional condition of the patient, but therapy should be performed no more than once.

- This therapy is very important for our military, because it helps to recover our patients. Drawing relaxes and thus reduces anxiety. And, if the fighter likes the result of his creation, he will be able to feel his value, - the doctor explains.

For two hours, the Armians built a certain "Victory" strategy for two hours, which grew into a true work of art. Each picture is in a personalized person, because it contains identification of a person and an individual perception of the more long-awaited triumph. One of the fighters depicted a ship "Vova", which is a hint of the already destroyed cruiser "Moscow", the second drew a built DAP, and another boy recreated his dream in which he was happy with his beloved ... The paintings came out different, but everyone managed to draw a special one. Victory Dawn.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-02T76-00-00-04-00/foto-9.jpg)- I am amazed that I got to draw it because I am not close to creativity. But this picture helped me feel relief and get rid of the car. There is a lot of work, so I am waiting for the next session, - one of the fighters shares.

Professional artists appreciated the work of each of the boys. Some even recognize that he did not expect such a result from a newcomer. But most importantly, the defenders liked the therapy process.

The work continues separately on the return of prisoners' servicemen from all places of freedom where they are held by the aggressor country.

Regarding the place of prisoners of war, the headquarters representative noted that Russia does not provide it.

It should be noted that the ICCH does not disclose information that they received and visited access to which they received and visited.

In accordance with the rules of international humanitarian law, communications of military people with their relatives must be ensured through leafed. But because the Russian Federation is not fulfilled for sections, there is no guarantee of receipt of letters.

Photo and video footage, testimony liberated from captivity, answers to trick-dependent lawyers- all this information is taken into account, it testifies to a pervasive stay of a person in captivity. But to officially recognize captivity must be a savage who holds the serviceman - the Ministry of Defense of Russian Federation.

Цікаво, що не лише політики багатьох країн, юристи від міжнародного права, а йзвичайні громадяни вимагають покарати винних за злочини агресії проти України.

«Поки матері та діти тікають від бомб і куль, путін прямо на наших очахздійснює „найвищий міжнародний злочин“ — військову агресію. Існує потужнийспосіб притягнути його до відповідальності: новий трибунал у стилі Нюрнберга,щоб переслідувати його особисто за цей жахливий вчинок», — йдеться у петиції.

«Як громадяни з усього світу ми настійно закликаємо вас притягнути путіна тайого спільників до особистої відповідальності за незаконне вторгнення вУкраїну шляхом створення нового Спеціального трибуналу для покарання злочинуагресії. Ми також закликаємо вас повністю підтримати окреме розслідуванняМіжнародного кримінального суду ймовірних воєнних злочинів і злочинів протилюдства в Україні. Без такої відповідальності ніколи не буде миру — мирозраховуємо на вас», — пишуть автори звернення.

Від 14 березня 2022 року, коли було розміщено петицію, її підписали 2 110 366людей з усього світу. Число тих, хто бажає бачити злочинців на лаві підсудних,щодня зростає.

The Head of State [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-hoche-mati-chitki-garantiyi-bezpeki-do-chlenstva-v-83369) під час зустрічі зпредставниками ЗМІ після переговорів із Президентом Естонії Аларом Карісом уКиєві.

«Ми не шукаємо заміни НАТО, і дуже важливо, щоб це чули наші партнери. Томутак багато зустрічей у нас на найвищому рівні. Ми не шукаємо альтернативи. Якя казав: наведіть мені приклад, яка країна НАТО воює із росією, або натериторії якої країни НАТО зараз присутні російські війська? Це свідчить проте, що це найкращі гарантії безпеки для України», — зазначив глава держави.

При цьому Президент зауважив, що **Україна не втягуватиме у війну жодну країнуАльянсу** , тому чудово розуміє, що не стане членом НАТО, поки триває війна зросією. «Не тому, що не хочемо, а тому, що це неможливо», — додав він.

За словами Володимира Зеленського, на сьогодні гарантіями безпеки для нашоїдержави є санкції, фінансові гарантії, зброя тощо.

«Це те, що є сьогодні не в документах, а в реальності. І якщо ми хочемо матигарантії на папері, то має бути чітко вказано, що ці гарантії безпеки діютьдля України доти, поки країна не отримає головних гарантій безпеки, а саме –членства в НАТО», — наголосив Президент.

Відповідаючи на запитання щодо ініціативи про створення коаліції «Петріотів»,про яку, зокрема, було оголошено на саміті Європейської політичної спільноти уМолдові, глава держави зазначив, що вже відбувся початковий етап їїформування.

«У нас були дуже важливі розмови щодо цього з Німеччиною, Данією,Нідерландами, ми говорили також із лідерами Європейського Союзу. Питання не втому, що кожна з цих країн може надати нам це (_PP systems. - ed ._). Апитання, що вони це шукатимуть.

** _ "I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

A brief report for this day. The first - I staged. Urgent security issues. A clear response to the death of people in Kiev through a closed shelter. Uniform about the inspection of protective structures in Kiev and all over the country. Responsible - Kamyshin and Klimenko ministers.

Unfortunately, today - after all - the people of Kiev again and again publish information about the inaccessibility of shelters. Not just about closed shelters, but about brewed in shelters, about the absence of shelters in general in some parts of the city. This level of negligence in the city is not covered with any excuses there.

They discussed all the details in relation to our air defense - its further development, supply and production of necessary missiles in Ukraine. The Ukrainian aerial board should be provided with everything you need on a constant basis. We are engaged in the Coalition of Petriots and a coalition of modern fighters - actively.

Very carefully - the situation on the front line, at all the points where the most rigid is now. I will not talk about it in more detail - the actions of our country, the active actions of our military will say what is needed. And separately he held a meeting on the preparation of new brigades, those who from the north to the south of our country accumulate power.

The second point for today - negotiated with the President of Estonia, who was in Kiev. First of all, safety is something that concerns our protection, as well as what is related to our safety long -term. Estonia helps us with weapons, technology, supports our NATO movement, generally understanding how important we are that we have victory over Rashism right now and on our Ukrainian land. This is important for every nation that is a terrorist state. I am sure that we will give this safety - so necessary, to Ukraine, to Ukraine, the whole of Europe and the free world victory over Russian aggression.And, by the way, I will make such an announcement: "Action" will help to develop state services and greetings, not only European - in Latin America and Africa.

The third is from different activities of this day, which is worth saying. The meeting of meetings, long and meaningful meetings, regarding the formation of our policy - complex - for the future. What is concerned with the further transformation of the state. What concerns our participation in global processes. As always, we prepare news and solutions that will give Ukraine and Ukrainians even more strength.

Thank you all who help our country!Glory to all our soldiers!Everyone who is now in battle for Ukraine.

I would like to point out today the 92nd separate mechanized brigade-the whole of this brigade, which extremely resistant to the Swatt Tavdalo reflecting enemy attacks, moving forward. Thank you, warriors!

The Avdiivsky direction ... The 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade-Thank you, the warriors, for your courage and your ability to powerfully destroy the occupiers. Well done!

I will note the border guards who have honored the state on the forefront of Zuzima with our defense and security forces. Lviv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr border guards that fight on the front. Thank you!And thank you to the fighters of the Chernyhiv border detachment, who are actively counteracted by Shahanedam. The speed and accuracy of our soldiers are critical. Thank you, the warriors, I get speed and for your accuracy!

He signed the decrees today on the celebration of our soldiers by state awards.263 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
