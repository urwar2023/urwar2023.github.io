<p>Concerning representatives of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, the special services of the Russian Federation prepare provocations. Such data of the SBU revealed during counterintelligence.</p>
<p>About this <a href="https://t.me/SBUkr/8654">it is referred</a>In the report of the Ukrainian special service.</p>
<p>In particular, according to operational data, employees of the 5 FSB Service of the Russian Federation plan a series, which should include misinformation about the alleged Russian citizenship of Ukrainian statesmen, the leadership of the forces of defense and safety and their Germans, as well as other officials.</p>
<p>The "plausibility" and the evidence base of fakes, among other things, should provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>entry of the FSB in the State Registers of the Russian Federation of records that allegedly must confirm the version of hostile special services; * forgery of documents of Ukrainian statesmen and representatives of defense forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to operational data, the start of the implementation of a hostile IPSO in the Ukrainian information field is scheduled for the near future.</p>
<p>Without success in the battlefield, the enemy seeks by any methods of undermining the psychological and emotional state of Ukrainian soldiers on the forefront and destabilizing the confidence in the country.</p>
<p>We urge representatives of the Ukrainian media to be critical of such "sensational" information. The SBU systematically monitors all such manipulations, exposes and delays the Kremlin agents, who deliberately help the enemy from the inside. We work together for the victory of Ukraine!</p>

That is, if an enterprise has a "mature" development in sphere arms and military equipment and wants the development to be used by VSKskh, now the whole process will take not years, but only 45 days.</p>
<p>The correspondent has decided to talk to one of these twenty businesses and to check whether it is really possible in such a short time. Agreed to talk Zarmiyainform representative of the manufacturer who already supplies to the troops shock Uak__phoenix 03 Heavy Ucav._</p>
<h3><strong> ‚ÄúActual work began in the last days of October. In December we got the cocks from the customer ‚Äù</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We began to produce the prototype of our UAV in March last year. The final was completed in the summer of 2022. At the same time, our development was presented to the landfilling of the Ministry of Defense under the auspices of the Drone Army. They have shown how our drone can manage light armored equipment and air goals. And in October, the representatives of the Ministry of Defense were coming to the meeting. They voiced the needs of drones for our army. From that moment on our company has been accompanied by the representative of the Department of Military and Technical Policy, the development of weapons of the Tavi Taurian equipment of the Ministry of Defense,-said the representative of the manufacturer Anatoly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, his company transferred to the TTH Dron Defense Ministry.He confirms that the accelerator declared 45 days to pass the enterprise(company)The whole procedure for admission to development is quite real:</p>
<ul>
<li>From my experience, I will say that most of the time can take from the manufacturer who starts cooperation with the Ministry of Defense, the preparation of the package of necessary toxicity.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> Upon start of cooperation with Mow Country Number of Specialists on the Business Tri Fault </strong></h3>
<p>Anatoly recalls that before the decision on cooperation with the Defense Ministry, his company has already produced several hundred of such drones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some units have long passed our drones for the use of the VSI. Therefore, our team and our drone were, as they say, "mature." After applying to the Ministry of Defense, we were painted specialty representative offices after applying to the Ministry of Defense: what they should follow throughout the process. There were some 20 stages. We have voiced the questions about them, which we were clear at the beginning, and experts explained all of us, gave samples of documents that were to be filled, - the manufacturer said.</li>
</ul>
<p>He notes that at the time of signing the contract with the DSSZZI, his company had 10 employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of signing the contract with the Defense Ministry - twice as much. And now the harbinger has increased three times ... Thanks to the well -established cooperation with the Ukrainian Ukraine managed to download production as much as possible. This made it possible to reduce the value of each drone by 30 %. Because we organized the optimal logistics route from the component supplier due to the planned volume of our purchases. It is a significant saving of funds for the state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anatoly specifies that his company now has a private investor.</p>
<ul>
<li>This, of course, facilitates the issue of purchasing components to drones. By the way, Ivinvestor was brought to us by the end consumer - those military who were given more than our drones, - says the company representative.</li>
</ul>
<p>He notes that the production of drones began to take care of a large -scale invasion.</p>
<ul>
<li>We already had an understanding of this case - earlier our colleagues and I had a relationship with the prisoners through work in film production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anatoly adds that their design is a drone Kamikadze. Allen's request of our military enterprise additionally made the UAVSKACHANISM of the discharge of ammunition.<em>Photo author</em></p>

<p>This was reported in a comment <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101674">Ukrainian Radio</a>The spokesman of the Air Force Command Yuri Ignat, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>According to him, the Air Force Telegram-Channel will inform the population of the main rocket attacks: "It is clear that all <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-povitrana-trivoga">air anxiety</a>It is hardly advisable to give, because we have an application "Air Anxiety", there are state institutions that are officially reported. We publish our official speeches there, the result of booe work per night. Yesterday(June 16 - Ed.)For example, 6 "daggers", 6 winged "Caliber" rockets, drones were destroyed. And we publish information - where we flew, how much we destroyed, which air brigade did.</p>
<p>However, where the missiles fly, he said, in the air forces will not - will only indicate the direction. "There will be notifications that TU-95 flew, for example, that they are moving to the Caspian area and there will be there They report to the population that there are likely launches. The air forces will do it from a proven source, and a verified telegram canal with a blue tick will be reported. A present link is not anonymous channels, in media representatives in particular, but an official source, "-said a spokesman for air forces Armed Forces.

"According to him, ordinary users of social networks are forbidden to publish a video of the air defense photos - this is one aspect. "The other is the direction of movement of rockets in real time, as well as to identify them with our system and non -detection - it is a key thing that is uncomfortable to speak." Ignati gave examples of unacceptable messages. "They came in and disappeared from radars, appeared in another area" - this information can be the most. "About the ban on showing fragments and the operation of air defense, apparently everyone knows. Fixing with mobile phones, devices, how our pppogeroically worked when several points of the city are removed from the same rocket, allows to model on the map lines that cross from the location. launch.

<p>According to Ukrinform, it reports <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/business/economy/federal-debt-32-trillion.html">The New York Times</a>With reference to the US Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>It is noted that an exceeding of the $ 32 trillion has occurred earlier than the pre-Pandemic forecasts, which reflects the trillion dollars of emergency expenses to overcome the effects of the Covid-1919 with slow economic growth of the country.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats have expressed concern for public debt, but no parties have expressed a desire to fight its greatest factors, such as social and health expenditures.</p>
<p>"Since we exceed $ 32 trillions, and the end is not visible, it is time for the fundamental reasons for our debt, which is the mandatory increase in costs and lack of sufficient income for their financing," said Michael A. Peterson, executive director of Peter G. Peterson, executive director which is the shortage of state debt deficit.</p>
<p>The Peterson Foundation has expressed concern for forecasts that show that for 30 years, the United States will increase public debt by 127 trillion dollars, and interest payments will be almost 40% of all -federal income by 2053.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian side is already working on developing a clear vision of further years to implement them. Olga Stephanyshyn said this in a comment to Ukrinform in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe continue to work on the implementation of seven recommendations of the European Commission, this is necessary to move to the next level of the EU accession process - the discrepancy of negotiations. The Venice Commission on June 10-13 published three-stage by two laws(About deoligarchization and national minorities - ed.)and one bill(On the procedure for selecting Judges of the CCU - ed.).

<p>At the same time, she paid attention to several points. In particular, commenting on the conclusion of the law No. 9322 on the improvement of the procedure for the selection of the Constitutional Court, Stephanishin noted that the Venice Commission supported the proposed approach.</p>

<p>She also noted that there were resistant consultations on the so -called anti -oligarchic law. ‚ÄúIn its conclusion, the Venice Commission is recommended to reproduce the implementation of the law.

<p>About it reports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/16/world/europe/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-collapse.html?auth=register-google">The New York Times</a>, which has conducted the inquiry, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>In particular, the publication refers to engineers from Ukraine and the United States, which means that the design of the dam was "Achilles' heel". And since the dam was built in Soviet times, all the engineering drawings were in Moscow and knew where the most vulnerable part of the structure was.</p>
<p>According to two American engineers, given the satellite and seismic about <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vibuh">explosions</a>In the area, the most likely reason for the destruction of the dam was the blasting of explosives laid in the Ucoridor for maintenance or tunnel, which passes through the concrete heartconstruction.</p>

The passage is an ideal place to accommodate this explosive charge," said the Geotechnikl West Engineer from Wiss, Janney, Elstner.</p>

<p>About it reports the guerrilla movement "Athesh" in <a href="http://t.me/atesh_ua/1028">telegram</a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"Our informants from the military hospitals of Kherson and Crimea report that many of the Russian Armed Forces are suspected of cholera. Targeted units from the Kherson direction, located along the North Criminal Canal, lose their combat capability and take out to the rear for treatment,"</p>
<p>According to the guerrillas, several Russian soldiers have already died.</p>
<p>Aths believes that this is most likely due to the use of water -sources from open sources, because they have problems with transportation or water purification.</p>
<p>"Of course, undermining the Kakhovsky dam caused tremendous harm to nature, revealing many diseases that we will still hear about," the guerrillas say.</p>

About it <a href="https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-povidomyla-pro-pidozru-dvom-odesytam-yaki-na-zamovlennia-rostb-znimaly-feiky-pro-mobilizatsiiu-ta-kyievopechersku-lavru">reports</a>Security Service of Ukraine.</p>
<p>One of the suspects is the former operator of Odessa State Television, who, after a full-scale invasion, began to cooperate with the Russian TV channel-TV.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the attacker agreed to the order of the propagandists. For 8 thousand hryvnias, he was familiar with his acquaintance for the role of the "military" of the local center of acquisition.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-17T42-00-00-04-00/9574414455ece020ba351f56949d7d7b.jpeg" />The two of them shot a video where the military told how to hunt the Zlovlovs of the conscript age to avoid mobilization.</p>
<p>This fake was aired by Russian Ren-TV, from where he was picked up by more than 20 propaganda information resources, including the largest federal tests.</p>
<p>SBU initiated psychological and linguistic examinations of this video confirmed the facts of criminal acts of the persons involved.</p>
<p>The involvement of the operator in the shooting of a number of custom scenes and events related to the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra is also checked.</p>
<p>The investigation found that, having released from state television, the husband worked in the Odessa branch of the "Independent Bureau of Journalistic Investigation".</p>
<p>After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he actively called for the support of the collectors and justified their military crimes on his social networks. Thus, he got into the field of view of the Kremlin propagandists and entered with them VKontakte.</p>
<p>In the course of searches conducted by the defendants, the SBU operatives found and seized:</p>
<ul>
<li>mobile phones, computers, professional video equipment and electronic media with evidence of illegal activity; * draft records; * Acting requisite: military uniforms and grilling means.</li>
</ul>

<p>The National Bank reminds the main indicators of a fraudulence within the campaign. It is necessary to stop talking with a fraudulence when you hear the following: they ask the card, the three-digit number on the back of the card, passwords, bank codes and mobile operators, PIN code to the card, control your telephone.(are asked to make a transaction, remove cash, set a program on your device, etc.), ask for photographing and send a photo payment card, frightened by the fact that your card is blocked, and criminals are broken, or they are asked to go to the link and indicate all the personal data of the payment card details.</p>

With the assistance of the United Tavriya defense forces, the Armyonform became known to be famous for how the analogue "alligator" followed the Russian military ship.</p>
<p>The pilot of the Russian helicopter quietly controlled the combat car. It was very confident that it was moving above the temporarily occupied territory of thawing below twenty meters, and the distance to Ukrainian positions was overwhelming. Performing the maneuvers at such a distance, the "Putin -screenwriting" felt almost invulnerable.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Marines, near the positions of which, had a Russian helicopter, were otherwise thought. The sub-air defense of a separate Marine Corps named after the counter-Admiralhail of Bilinsky performed the task of covering during counter-offensive. Marpich with a call sign "Summer" visually determined the target that was identified as a "Russian shock helicopter KA-52".</p>
<ul>
<li>And then everything they taught: I saw, hit, destroyed, - says Summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The missile, launched from Igla MSrk, hit the tail of the helicopter. Further, "summer", along with the brothers, watched a picturesque picture: praised "alligator", leaving behind the fatty thick smoke, began to lose its height sharply and disappeared from the field of view for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the observers who were in the infantry units of the brigade received confirmation of the affected target. The Alligator has fallen in a territory that is still under the control of the occupiers. So, another praised Russian "alligator" has turned into scrap, which spoils the amazing landscapes of the Ukrainian nature. "But this is a temporary phenomenon," our Marines say.</p>

<p>The State Inspectorate has already calculated indicative losses for these territories and they are colossal. More than UAH 15 billion, Kamianskaya Sich, for the Great Lug National Park - over UAH 73 billion.</p>
<p>This is stated in <a href="https://mepr.gov.ua/ruslan-strilets-cherez-terorystychnyj-akt-rosiyi-na-kahovskij-ges-taki-natsparky-yak-velykyj-lug-ta-kam-yanska-sich-postupovo-peretvoryuyutsya-na-pustelyu/">material</a>at the official website of the environment and natural resources of Ukraine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is projected that the area of land in these parks will increase by thousands ofgigectors, almost twice. The National Park "Great Meadow" - for more than 7 thousand hectares, "Kamianskaya Sich" - for 5.5 thousand hectares ", - quotes the website of the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine Ruslan Stilts.</p>
<p>According to him, at a time when today the whole civilized world notes the fight against desertification and droughts and directs efforts against this problem, we are talking about the consequences of Russian terror on Ukrainian land. The world has no right to forgive this environmental terror of the aggressor country. Armed agression of Russians is not only losses here and now. These are global challenges for future generations.</p>
<p>"Recently flowering areas and fertile soils can turn into a desert. This will lead to a rise in temperatures and deepen the climatic crisis. Increase drought and extreme weather phenomena. The world must understand that such actions of the country-terrorist destroys not only Ukraine. The consequences will feel everyone. The aggressor is hungry whole continents. After all, our supply depends on the life of people in the Middle East and Asia. And this is about 400 million people, ‚ÄùRuslan shook.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn order to restore these territories to the natural state, the animal tassel will be recreated for decades. Mindovil's experts already work over development of such programs and events. Everyone in its place does what Ukraine has to victory, ‚Äùthe ministry said.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the advantage of this drone? It is small in size, low -level noise engines, zero thermal signature, the possibility of a controlled decrease in radio signal and radio translucent materials. All this makes it almost not noticeable for radars. Punisher flies up to 45 kilometers and needs 15 minutes. After 5 minutes of recharging is ready for the next task. In addition to direct action, this drone is used for reconnaissance, searching for a pilgrim, it can carry a container with medicines discharged. It is a high -precision alternative trucker artillery abortion to defeat targets at 25-45 km, - said UA Dynamics, who developed a drone Punisher, <strong> Maxim Music </strong>.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-06-17T91-00-00-04-00/yevropejskyj-soyuz.jpg" />This week, the Central Election Commission of the Russian Academy of Sciences decided to hold in September "elections" in the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia, which is an apartment of international law.</p>
<p>This is stated in <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia-statement-spokesperson-intentions-hold-%E2%80%9Celections%E2%80%9D-occupied-territories-ukraine_en?channel=eeas_press_alerts&amp;date=2023-06-17&amp;newsid=0&amp;langid=en&amp;source=mail">statement</a>Leading foreign affairs spokesman and security policy of the European Union, published on the EU's official website.</p>
<p>This is another vain attempt to make a legitimization of its illegal control and annexation attempts to annexation of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhya Tacherson regions of Ukraine, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>The statement emphasizes that such a decision seriously violates the UN Statute, Independence, Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine. In Russia, there are no legal grounds for any such actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRussia, its political leadership and all those involved in the organization of such such elections will have the consequences of their illegal actions. The European Union is adamant in its support of Ukraine. Russia must immediately withdraw all its troops and military equipment from all over its territory within its internationally recognized borders, ‚Äùthe document states.</p>

<p>According to the officer, in general, these missiles are designed to destroy surfaces, but at the same time can also be used from Tagelycopter aircraft.</p>
<p>-The peculiarity of the X-35 missile is that it is very difficult to notice because it flies quite low above the water surface. But in its own characteristics, it is actually no different from the same "caliber" of the TSIRILITY RODER X-101. However, the battle part of her three times is smaller, - Yuri Ignat said.</p>

<p>Refut <a href="https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/russische-propaganda-erfindet-stern-meldung-ueber-verletzten-ukrainischen-geheimdienstchef-33568256.html">placed the magazine himself</a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRussian propagandists with reference to Stern claim that the head of the Ukrainian special service is in a coma at a hospital of Berlin. But notified, ‚Äùthe article reads.</p>
<p>It states that 1.3 million readers of the Telegram channel Volodymyraslovyov, the most notable propagandist Putin, may have been a happy Saturday morning, reading the following post: "Budanov in a coma-according to the German journalist".</p>

<p>Solovyov claims that Stern reporters, they say, were anonymously talked by the clinic-hospitals where Budanov was hospitalized, and they said that the head of Ukrainian special service was traumatic brain injury, prognosis for the healthy health.</p>

<p>References to the German edition could also be found in Saturday other popular Russian Telegram channels and even some foreign languages-three languages, even in German, as in the Italian fake information agency "Nova News", which is obviously used by Russia for the spread.</p>
<p>The last article about the head of intelligence Budanov, which was published by a magazine dated this year.</p>
<p>"So history is nothing more than a fake, another hoax, which is developed by Russian propagandists ... This is another proof of what primitive method of Russia in combination with information agencies, powerful propagandists on the social network Telegram and fictional reports of Western. The scheme is worked and repeated on the day of the war, ‚Äùthe newspaper says.Obviously, the calculation was that the reader is unlikely to check the primary source. It is clear that the refutations of the Russians do not know.</p>
<p>Obviously, fake news is part of the Great Russian <strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-dezinformacia">misinformation</a></strong> Campactions aimed at Budanova: the State Information Agency of RIA News reported that it was seriously injured during the Russian missile shelling of Kyiv on the 29th day and delivered to Berlin, according to the article in the German magazine.</p>

<p>Earlier, RIA also reported a likely serious injury to the Ukrainian story commander -in -chief Valery Zaluzhny.</p>
