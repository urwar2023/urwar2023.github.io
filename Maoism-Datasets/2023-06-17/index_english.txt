Concerning representatives of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, the special services of the Russian Federation prepare provocations. Such data of the SBU revealed during counterintelligence.
About this it is referred In the report of the Ukrainian special service.
In particular, according to operational data, employees of the 5 FSB Service of the Russian Federation plan a series, which should include misinformation about the alleged Russian citizenship of Ukrainian statesmen, the leadership of the forces of defense and safety and their Germans, as well as other officials.
The "plausibility" and the evidence base of fakes, among other things, should provide:
According to operational data, the start of the implementation of a hostile IPSO in the Ukrainian information field is scheduled for the near future.
Without success in the battlefield, the enemy seeks by any methods of undermining the psychological and emotional state of Ukrainian soldiers on the forefront and destabilizing the confidence in the country.
We urge representatives of the Ukrainian media to be critical of such "sensational" information. The SBU systematically monitors all such manipulations, exposes and delays the Kremlin agents, who deliberately help the enemy from the inside. We work together for the victory of Ukraine!

Якщо порівнювати, наприклад, з Києво-Печерською лаврою,то за моєю інформацією, добровільно переходити священнослужителі СвятогірськоїЛаври не збираються. Усі необхідні документи до Мінкульту і правоохороннихорганів ми надали», - сказав Кириленко.

 As previously reported, our warriors destroyed another precious hostile helicopter KA-52, known as the "alligator". With the assistance of the United Tavriya defense forces, the Armyonform became known to be famous for how the analogue "alligator" followed the Russian military ship.
The pilot of the Russian helicopter quietly controlled the combat car. It was very confident that it was moving above the temporarily occupied territory of thawing below twenty meters, and the distance to Ukrainian positions was overwhelming. Performing the maneuvers at such a distance, the "Putin -screenwriting" felt almost invulnerable.
The Ukrainian Marines, near the positions of which, had a Russian helicopter, were otherwise thought. The sub-air defense of a separate Marine Corps named after the counter-Admiralhail of Bilinsky performed the task of covering during counter-offensive. Marpich with a call sign "Summer" visually determined the target that was identified as a "Russian shock helicopter KA-52".
The missile, launched from Igla MSrk, hit the tail of the helicopter. Further, "summer", along with the brothers, watched a picturesque picture: praised "alligator", leaving behind the fatty thick smoke, began to lose its height sharply and disappeared from the field of view for a few seconds.
Subsequently, the observers who were in the infantry units of the brigade received confirmation of the affected target. The Alligator has fallen in a territory that is still under the control of the occupiers. So, another praised Russian "alligator" has turned into scrap, which spoils the amazing landscapes of the Ukrainian nature. "But this is a temporary phenomenon," our Marines say.
