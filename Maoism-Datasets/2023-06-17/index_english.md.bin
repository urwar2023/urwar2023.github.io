According to her, Russians want to use foreigners, especially children, as a living during a Ukrainian offensive. This applies to all temporarily occupied territories, including Crimea.

“We have serious grounds for such an appeal. This is especially true of tubular who, because of Russian propaganda, do not have complete information about what is happening. Our army has started offensive. Therefore, please make sure that foreign citizens in temporarily occupied territories, especially in Ukrainian Crimea, have: neither adults nor children. Because the invaders will use them as a live shield or sacred casualties, ”the Vice Prime Minister summarized.

Concerning representatives of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, the special services of the Russian Federation prepare provocations. Such data of the SBU revealed during counterintelligence.

About this [it is referred](https://t.me/SBUkr/8654)In the report of the Ukrainian special service.

In particular, according to operational data, employees of the 5 FSB Service of the Russian Federation plan a series, which should include misinformation about the alleged Russian citizenship of Ukrainian statesmen, the leadership of the forces of defense and safety and their Germans, as well as other officials.

The "plausibility" and the evidence base of fakes, among other things, should provide:

* entry of the FSB in the State Registers of the Russian Federation of records that allegedly must confirm the version of hostile special services; * forgery of documents of Ukrainian statesmen and representatives of defense forces.

According to operational data, the start of the implementation of a hostile IPSO in the Ukrainian information field is scheduled for the near future.

Without success in the battlefield, the enemy seeks by any methods of undermining the psychological and emotional state of Ukrainian soldiers on the forefront and destabilizing the confidence in the country.

We urge representatives of the Ukrainian media to be critical of such "sensational" information. The SBU systematically monitors all such manipulations, exposes and delays the Kremlin agents, who deliberately help the enemy from the inside. We work together for the victory of Ukraine!

In one of our publications we _ [_ reported_](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/09/45-dniv-zamist-2-rokiv-vidteper-novitni-tehnologiyi-zaprovadzhuvatymut-u-zsu-znachno-shvydshe/)_, there are two dozen enterprises that have already passed all stages - from the submission of prohibition to operation - for one and a half months!It is about such terms that the accelerator team declares. That is, if an enterprise has a "mature" development in sphere arms and military equipment and wants the development to be used by VSKskh, now the whole process will take not years, but only 45 days.

The correspondent has decided to talk to one of these twenty businesses and to check whether it is really possible in such a short time. Agreed to talk Zarmiyainform representative of the manufacturer who already supplies to the troops shock Uak__phoenix 03 Heavy Ucav._

### ** “Actual work began in the last days of October. In December we got the cocks from the customer ”**

- We began to produce the prototype of our UAV in March last year. The final was completed in the summer of 2022. At the same time, our development was presented to the landfilling of the Ministry of Defense under the auspices of the Drone Army. They have shown how our drone can manage light armored equipment and air goals. And in October, the representatives of the Ministry of Defense were coming to the meeting. They voiced the needs of drones for our army. From that moment on our company has been accompanied by the representative of the Department of Military and Technical Policy, the development of weapons of the Tavi Taurian equipment of the Ministry of Defense,-said the representative of the manufacturer Anatoly.

Subsequently, his company transferred to the TTH Dron Defense Ministry.He confirms that the accelerator declared 45 days to pass the enterprise(company)The whole procedure for admission to development is quite real:

- From my experience, I will say that most of the time can take from the manufacturer who starts cooperation with the Ministry of Defense, the preparation of the package of necessary toxicity.

### ** Upon start of cooperation with Mow Country Number of Specialists on the Business Tri Fault **

Anatoly recalls that before the decision on cooperation with the Defense Ministry, his company has already produced several hundred of such drones.

- Some units have long passed our drones for the use of the VSI. Therefore, our team and our drone were, as they say, "mature." After applying to the Ministry of Defense, we were painted specialty representative offices after applying to the Ministry of Defense: what they should follow throughout the process. There were some 20 stages. We have voiced the questions about them, which we were clear at the beginning, and experts explained all of us, gave samples of documents that were to be filled, - the manufacturer said.

He notes that at the time of signing the contract with the DSSZZI, his company had 10 employees:

- At the time of signing the contract with the Defense Ministry - twice as much. And now the harbinger has increased three times ... Thanks to the well -established cooperation with the Ukrainian Ukraine managed to download production as much as possible. This made it possible to reduce the value of each drone by 30 %. Because we organized the optimal logistics route from the component supplier due to the planned volume of our purchases. It is a significant saving of funds for the state.

Anatoly specifies that his company now has a private investor.

- This, of course, facilitates the issue of purchasing components to drones. By the way, Ivinvestor was brought to us by the end consumer - those military who were given more than our drones, - says the company representative.

He notes that the production of drones began to take care of a large -scale invasion.

- We already had an understanding of this case - earlier our colleagues and I had a relationship with the prisoners through work in film production.

Anatoly adds that their design is a drone Kamikadze. Allen's request of our military enterprise additionally made the UAVSKACHANISM of the discharge of ammunition._Photo author_

According to Ukrinform, it reports [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/business/economy/federal-debt-32-trillion.html)With reference to the US Ministry of Finance.

It is noted that an exceeding of the $ 32 trillion has occurred earlier than the pre-Pandemic forecasts, which reflects the trillion dollars of emergency expenses to overcome the effects of the Covid-1919 with slow economic growth of the country.

Republicans and Democrats have expressed concern for public debt, but no parties have expressed a desire to fight its greatest factors, such as social and health expenditures.

"Since we exceed $ 32 trillions, and the end is not visible, it is time for the fundamental reasons for our debt, which is the mandatory increase in costs and lack of sufficient income for their financing," said Michael A. Peterson, executive director of Peter G. Peterson, executive director which is the shortage of state debt deficit.

The Peterson Foundation has expressed concern for forecasts that show that for 30 years, the United States will increase public debt by 127 trillion dollars, and interest payments will be almost 40% of all -federal income by 2053.

Pavel Kirilenko, the head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, in [interview Ukrinform](http://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-regions/3724163-pavlo-kirilenko-kerivnik-doneckoi-oblasnoi-vijskovoi-administracii.html).

"We will promote the deployment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine in the territory of the region, to allocate land, to restore the possibilities of conducting services," - said the head of the region.

He emphasized that the inhabitants of Donetsk region should understand that the Patriarchate is carrying with him.

"We need to understand the evil of the Moscow Patriarchate with its holy servants, who are not exactly in the full sense of this Slavic servants, through which a person can come with his hardships, problems and turn to God," Kirilenko said.

He explained that there are many examples now where there were clear facts of confirmation of the liberation of the clergymen of the Moscow Patriarchate from the Special Service of the Russian Federation.

The head of the Ova recalled that before the Easter, Metropolitan Donetsk, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Father Sergei came and conducted all over the territory of the region, especially in the communities, worship, even on the front line. He also gave the Easter Care and Humanitarian Aid, and the locally the regional authorities contributed to this as much as possible.

According to Kirilenko, Svyatogorsk Lavra, which is located in the territory of Donetsk region, has not legally passed to the PCU, but it is a difficult process that is held.

“Legally(Svyatogorsk Lavra - Ed.)has not gone yet(Before the PC - ed.). Є зюридичної точки зору різниця в оформленні документів і права власності уСвятогірській лаврі. Якщо порівнювати, наприклад, з Києво-Печерською лаврою,то за моєю інформацією, добровільно переходити священнослужителі СвятогірськоїЛаври не збираються. Усі необхідні документи до Мінкульту і правоохороннихорганів ми надали», - сказав Кириленко.

According to two American engineers, given the satellite and seismic about [explosions](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vibuh)In the area, the most likely reason for the destruction of the dam was the blasting of explosives laid in the Ucoridor for maintenance or tunnel, which passes through the concrete heartconstruction.

About it reports the guerrilla movement "Athesh" in [telegram](http://t.me/atesh_ua/1028), reports Ukrinform.

"Our informants from the military hospitals of Kherson and Crimea report that many of the Russian Armed Forces are suspected of cholera. Targeted units from the Kherson direction, located along the North Criminal Canal, lose their combat capability and take out to the rear for treatment,"

According to the guerrillas, several Russian soldiers have already died.

Aths believes that this is most likely due to the use of water -sources from open sources, because they have problems with transportation or water purification.

"Of course, undermining the Kakhovsky dam caused tremendous harm to nature, revealing many diseases that we will still hear about," the guerrillas say.

One of the suspects is the former operator of Odessa State Television, who, after a full-scale invasion, began to cooperate with the Russian TV channel-TV.

According to the investigation, the attacker agreed to the order of the propagandists. For 8 thousand hryvnias, he was familiar with his acquaintance for the role of the "military" of the local center of acquisition.

This fake was aired by Russian Ren-TV, from where he was picked up by more than 20 propaganda information resources, including the largest federal tests.

SBU initiated psychological and linguistic examinations of this video confirmed the facts of criminal acts of the persons involved.

The involvement of the operator in the shooting of a number of custom scenes and events related to the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra is also checked.

The investigation found that, having released from state television, the husband worked in the Odessa branch of the "Independent Bureau of Journalistic Investigation".

After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he actively called for the support of the collectors and justified their military crimes on his social networks. Thus, he got into the field of view of the Kremlin propagandists and entered with them VKontakte.

In the course of searches conducted by the defendants, the SBU operatives found and seized:

* mobile phones, computers, professional video equipment and electronic media with evidence of illegal activity; * draft records; * Acting requisite: military uniforms and grilling means.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-17T56-00-00-04-00/photo_2023-06-17_07-57-23.jpg)As previously reported, our warriors destroyed another precious hostile helicopter KA-52, known as the "alligator". With the assistance of the United Tavriya defense forces, the Armyonform became known to be famous for how the analogue "alligator" followed the Russian military ship.

The pilot of the Russian helicopter quietly controlled the combat car. It was very confident that it was moving above the temporarily occupied territory of thawing below twenty meters, and the distance to Ukrainian positions was overwhelming. Performing the maneuvers at such a distance, the "Putin -screenwriting" felt almost invulnerable.

The Ukrainian Marines, near the positions of which, had a Russian helicopter, were otherwise thought. The sub-air defense of a separate Marine Corps named after the counter-Admiralhail of Bilinsky performed the task of covering during counter-offensive. Marpich with a call sign "Summer" visually determined the target that was identified as a "Russian shock helicopter KA-52".

- And then everything they taught: I saw, hit, destroyed, - says Summer.

The missile, launched from Igla MSrk, hit the tail of the helicopter. Further, "summer", along with the brothers, watched a picturesque picture: praised "alligator", leaving behind the fatty thick smoke, began to lose its height sharply and disappeared from the field of view for a few seconds.

Subsequently, the observers who were in the infantry units of the brigade received confirmation of the affected target. The Alligator has fallen in a territory that is still under the control of the occupiers. So, another praised Russian "alligator" has turned into scrap, which spoils the amazing landscapes of the Ukrainian nature. "But this is a temporary phenomenon," our Marines say.

The State Inspectorate has already calculated indicative losses for these territories and they are colossal. More than UAH 15 billion, Kamianskaya Sich, for the Great Lug National Park - over UAH 73 billion.

This is stated in [material](https://mepr.gov.ua/ruslan-strilets-cherez-terorystychnyj-akt-rosiyi-na-kahovskij-ges-taki-natsparky-yak-velykyj-lug-ta-kam-yanska-sich-postupovo-peretvoryuyutsya-na-pustelyu/)at the official website of the environment and natural resources of Ukraine.

“It is projected that the area of land in these parks will increase by thousands ofgigectors, almost twice. The National Park "Great Meadow" - for more than 7 thousand hectares, "Kamianskaya Sich" - for 5.5 thousand hectares ", - quotes the website of the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine Ruslan Stilts.

According to him, at a time when today the whole civilized world notes the fight against desertification and droughts and directs efforts against this problem, we are talking about the consequences of Russian terror on Ukrainian land. The world has no right to forgive this environmental terror of the aggressor country. Armed agression of Russians is not only losses here and now. These are global challenges for future generations.

"Recently flowering areas and fertile soils can turn into a desert. This will lead to a rise in temperatures and deepen the climatic crisis. Increase drought and extreme weather phenomena. The world must understand that such actions of the country-terrorist destroys not only Ukraine. The consequences will feel everyone. The aggressor is hungry whole continents. After all, our supply depends on the life of people in the Middle East and Asia. And this is about 400 million people, ”Ruslan shook.

“In order to restore these territories to the natural state, the animal tassel will be recreated for decades. Mindovil's experts already work over development of such programs and events. Everyone in its place does what Ukraine has to victory, ”the ministry said.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-17T91-00-00-04-00/yevropejskyj-soyuz.jpg)This week, the Central Election Commission of the Russian Academy of Sciences decided to hold in September "elections" in the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia, which is an apartment of international law.

This is stated in [statement](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia-statement-spokesperson-intentions-hold-%E2%80%9Celections%E2%80%9D-occupied-territories-ukraine_en?channel=eeas_press_alerts&date=2023-06-17&newsid=0&langid=en&source=mail)Leading foreign affairs spokesman and security policy of the European Union, published on the EU's official website.

This is another vain attempt to make a legitimization of its illegal control and annexation attempts to annexation of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhya Tacherson regions of Ukraine, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.

The statement emphasizes that such a decision seriously violates the UN Statute, Independence, Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine. In Russia, there are no legal grounds for any such actions in Ukraine.

“Russia, its political leadership and all those involved in the organization of such such elections will have the consequences of their illegal actions. The European Union is adamant in its support of Ukraine. Russia must immediately withdraw all its troops and military equipment from all over its territory within its internationally recognized borders, ”the document states.

According to the officer, in general, these missiles are designed to destroy surfaces, but at the same time can also be used from Tagelycopter aircraft.

-The peculiarity of the X-35 missile is that it is very difficult to notice because it flies quite low above the water surface. But in its own characteristics, it is actually no different from the same "caliber" of the TSIRILITY RODER X-101. However, the battle part of her three times is smaller, - Yuri Ignat said.

“Russian propagandists with reference to Stern claim that the head of the Ukrainian special service is in a coma at a hospital of Berlin. But notified, ”the article reads.
