The four rockets, one of which were destroyed, were unfortunately struck by objects in Dnipropetrovsk.

However, the Head of the Command of the Command of Air Forces emphasizes, it is always necessary to remember at what price of Ukrainian prototypical defense these whipped UAVs, missiles and other aircraft are given. This is the main thing, it is about the number of anti -aircraft managed missiles, which are used to destroy these air goals.

“Now the Russians are spreading two main theses. The first is about the allegedly large losses of the personal staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Such information is aimed at demoralizing the Ukrainian army from one way, and on the other, on the contrary, to raise a spiritual army. Therefore, in this situation, it can be noted that, first, during the war, the same of the parties does not publish accurate data of its losses, because the enemy is nigger and can adjust its plans, including to assume and calculate our plans. Now we can talk only about the ratio, which at the beginning of the 2014 and a large -scale invasion of 2022, brief: the number of dead on the Ukrainian side is much or much or more than times lower than the loss of the enemy. Yesterday we published these figures. If we talk about last week, in the area of operational responsibility of the operative-strategic groups of the Khortytsia troops, enemies were killed almost more times more than our servicemen. Speaking of the pronounced direction, the enemies were killed 5.3 times more than the Ukrainian people. The life of our warriors is the most valuable for us and is a priority in the time of planning military operations.

The second narrative, spread by the Russians to discredit military aid, refers to Bradley armored vehicles that partners provide us. " During the time briefing, Anna Malyar demonstrated a photo of Bradley BMP(M2 Bradley), in which the shell of the RSZV "Grad" was combined. In the first photo - the machine immediately after the direct number, on the second - a crew, which was successfully evacuated and continues to fulfill the tasks on other technique.

"Despite the fact that our headquarters is dealing with the liberation of prisoners of war, we also try to forget from Russian captivity and our civilian citizens, using our exchange fund for this purpose," the Ombudsman's representative is explained.

According to him, the search and liberation of such persons is complicated by the fact that the Russian notes do not confirm the maintenance on their or temporarily occupied territories of civilian citizens, because it is an international crime. Nevertheless, Ukraine has an effort to make an effort to press on Russia at the international level and to require a non -civilian return to the Motherland.

Also, families were interested in hostages of civilians whether they were threatened with criminal responsibility after returning home. The representative of the ex -inspiring was that civilians were not threatened with criminal liability, even if they were forced to receive Russian passports: “We understand that it is often the emphasis on survival. Therefore, of course, such persons will not bear the responsibility for it. ”

According to a coordination representative, after returning home, Ukrainian services carry out a number of inspections of liberated persons. If it is possible that one or the other person has agreed to cooperate with the enemy and already manage to harm our country, such person will be held accountable.

According to operational data, employees of the 5th FSB Service of the Russian Federation are planning a number of IPSO, which should include misinformation about the alleged Russian citizenship of Ukrainian statesmen, the management of forces of defense and security and their Germans, as well as other officials.

About it [reports](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-poperedzhaie-pro-pidhotovku-nyzky-novykh-ipso-spetssluzhbamy-rf)Security Service of Ukraine.

The "plausibility" and the evidence base of fakes, among other things, should provide:

* entry of the FSB in the State Registers of the Russian Federation of records that allegedly have to confirm the version of hostile special services; * forgery of documents of Ukrainian statesmen and representatives of defense forces.

According to operational data, ** The start of the realization of a hostile IPSO in the Ukrainian information field is planned for the near future. ** **

Without success in the battlefield, the enemy seeks by any methods of undermining the psychological and emotional state of Ukrainian soldiers on the forefront and destabilizing the confidence in the country.

The Security Service urges Ukrainian media representatives to critically treat such "sensational" information.

Ukraine should stand in the position of rejection of any nuclear blackmail. This [emphasized](https://www.facebook.com/danilov.oleksiy/posts/pfbid0CnPRp4XEt3t9UVaNdzSxpZxye8WfPqi48Cn2P6SdnjmrhdYrwzFjfVcWee3vGVdLl)Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexey Danilov.

He noted the increased mention of the threat of nuclear war and called the "manipulative" formulation of the question of the threat of Putin's use of nuclear weapons.

“The thesis that, in my opinion, will now actively move to the Kremlin(Yunovorskaya key to the fundamental Western Phobias)that the presence of a nuclear bomb should automatically exclude the resistance of a country that has no such weapons. The country is the object of an attack of a nuclear state, if you go proposed by logic, provokes the threat of nuclear apocalypse. And in such a sequence the object of condemnation becomes not the aggressor, but the victim

We want to tell us: give up and do not resist? We do not need your freedom, we need our comfort and safety? This opinion will be tried to form in the world to refuse to support Ukraine, which by its actions, it turns out, "provokes" Russia ", - said Alexei Danilov.

According to the NSDC Secretary, in order for this false and deceptive logic not to become, we must not tired firmly and consistently in the position of not receiving any nuclear blackmail.

"We are not afraid of the so -called" second army of the world "nor the first in size of existing Russia, nor Putin's bunker rats and his nuclear bunk. Let us only be one - to lose freedom and in the struggle for it we will go to the end, ”he added.

The problem of the Kremlin's nuclear madness, Oleksiy Danilov, is a non -violent exclusively Ukraine, it is the problem of the world.

“The world has long watched and if it did not knowingly help, then it did not interfere with the growth of the Russian monster. It was when Ukraine was forced to pass the second largest arsenal to the Russian nuclear arsenal, to equip the Russian Army Army with our winged rockets, when the world was a donor of modern technologies, a buyer of oil and gas, which became the basis for the financing of construction. When the international elites were corrupted and the Russian oligarchy was opened.

However, it is obvious that he cannot work on his own. To protect Ukraine requires a sufficient amount of SAC of different types, both small and medium range, which will cover the objects in a single air defense system.

- That is, now the main problem in quantity, which is determined on the basis of the translation of important state objects that need cover. It is clear that we will not be able to quit the whole country in any case. Even Americans have closed expedited state sites, troops, training bases. The Ukrainian Ukraine has been closed except for Israel, thanks to modern technologies, a tweezing small area. We have a different situation. At the same time, there are no problems with the integration of complexes into the overall air defense system of Ukraine in general. We went through this stage after obtaining Iris-T, Crotale, NASAMS complexes ... Now we integrate at least an Indian complex and begin to consolidate. Our connectors do really incredible things - integrated the waxing system of information processing data that comes from radars of Western systems ...

And before May 4 this year, no one was sure that the Patriotna complex was capable.

- All training on the use of the Patriot complex on different types of baptist missiles, which are in service with the aggressor countries, were conducted in the regime. But even during the simulation of the air situation, the results were not 100 percent. Our subdivision, the first calculations that less than three months studied, were able to destroy the X-47 hypersonic missile, which Putin was attributed to the category of "Analognit". Frankly, I myself realized that we were knocking down the "dagger" only after the study of the debris with expert analysts. And already on May 16, it was clear that it is definitely not a chance. Almost simultaneously, from different directions, there were16 ballistic goals, most of them are aimed at the Patriot complex. I always write down my subordinates, but this time I was shocked by their endurance. People realized that ballistic missiles were moving directly on them. They were not planted for a second, acted harmoniously and organized, distributed whole sectors, ensured their destruction at a minimum range, sufficiently high to reduce the likelihood of infrastructure damage. I was in contact with the division commander and understood what a serious professional and moral testing. After the report: "Air space is pure, all goals were destroyed" —Mebration no one restrained ... Later we learned that there were 6 "daggers" among these purposes. I think the same emotions as we have had partner countries. You do not come up with the best advertising for manufacturers, their complex has realized themselves with a complete measure, proved that he was able to destroy the goals that the Russians positioned impossible for beating.

The anti -aircraft has a tradition of marked on the complexes destroyed goals. However, Colonelmanko says that the dagger stencil has not yet been made, although in total Patriotz has already destroyed more than 80 air purposes for a month.

He chose the time of visit himself, based on his official employment and state of health, with the help of special software "E-Merga".

- In the medical service of our military unit, I was helped to register for a date convenient for me, - says the defender of Ukraine. -It so happened that during 2022-2023. For the second time, I have to pass the VLK in this hospital. So I have to compare. I have to say that E-Brga is modern, quickly and effectively. I will not say that the queues near certain offices in the clinic have completely disappeared, but there was definitely more.

According to the command of the military-medical institution, the first version of the e-n-monk was introduced in February 2023.

-Four months ago, we used our own technological development to record and pass the Military Medical Commission,-explains the head of the departmental medical staff. - The results were quite significant then. In May, we will establish a better version of "E-Berg". I note that we have successfully implemented other technological innovations, namely: MIS MISTS SMART, specialized ER Hospital software, Tracker software and others.

By the way, from the beginning of a large-scale invasion of occupiers in this medical facility has increased the number of visitors among the defenders and defenders of Ukraine. Of course, the burden on all doctors increased proportionally, working with visitors in the clinic.

[!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T92-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-5-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harkiv-gospital-5-scaled.jpg)

[![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T92-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-6-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harkiv-gospital-6.jpg)The temporary executor of the chief of the clinic explained that through professional features, queues sometimes occur near the offices of such doctors as: neuropathologist, traumatologist or psychiatrist.She added that quite often they come to them boys and girls of the spare registration in the E-Brga system. For various reasons, some units of units do not yet enjoy the possibilities of innovation. Therefore, the warriors are divided by the corresponding paper documents for the VLK.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T92-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-1-scaled.jpg)-Of course, we do not refuse to anyone and accept everyone without records in "E-Berg". However, it should be understood that in such cases there is some correction of schedules of visiting doctors. There is another point here. Yes, if one is a well -deserved person after injury on crutches comes to us, then we somehow go to help her. But what do we do when such soldiers in one day do not get one or two? As a practitioner, E-Merga is a very efficiency in terms of the VLK. I believe that everything will gradually work out and all the employees will send people to us only after electronic registration, - said the military doctor.

According to this military medical institution, they do not hide problematic questions and are constantly working on their solution.

- In the event of any difficulty in passing the VLK or on other questions, anyone can call in working hours at number(099)7692113.This is the hotline of our medical institution. Everyone is listened to and locked the call. Finally, I ask our visitors instead of unreasonable criticism of doctors in shoulder straps, first to understand the causes of the problem of thadiz to be tieddiz to our medical and diagnostic capabilities,-assured the head of the medical institution of the defense department.

** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!**

Report for this day. The first is that we have significant international steps that enhance our position in several directions.

The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution to support the European Taiuro -Atlantic aspirations of our people. There is a specific call for a leadership euro union to define a clear way of acquiring our state membership in the EU.

And in the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament captures the meaning of our Ukrainian universal in Euro -Atlantic security, which stipulates that the path of Ukraine in NATO is a state -of -the -art invitation to entry in the context of the preparation for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius. Time for integration and security is obviously came, and I thank you for the actual statement of this to all members of the European Parliament and Ms. President of the European Parliament Roberti Metzoli, as well as the head of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for constant irregular work with the parliament.

The second important international step for today is the bill on confiscation and transfer of our state as a reparation of the Russian state-the terrorist state. I thank the US senators who have a biparty support for this issue for justice for Ukraine's Tavi victims of Russian terror.

In dictatorships such as Russian, money is the highest value. And even more of persons who serve the management regime or are actually owners of state structures.

When the state-terrorist and all Russian persons whose labeling with the Kremlin loses its money with the Kremlin created the conditions for Russian aggression or which are an inviocean cover for Russian corrupt officials, then a very important goal will be achieved-they will feel what loss is. They do not respect life and are nothable when human lives are lost. The Russian dominant class does not appreciate the people and is ready to spend human lives for hundreds of thousands. But they regret the money - those who have appropriated by the way. They value their assets. They should be lost, and in favor of those who suffered from their aggression, from this terrorist war in favor of our country, our people.

Today he continued to appeal to the parliaments of our partners.He also spent telephone conversations with representatives of the two countries-Belize and Costa Rica. We build new partnerships for Ukraine-to support the formula of peace and our resolution in the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law as a whole. The discussion of Mr. Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister Belize is the opportunity to organize a meeting of Ukraine-Latin America. We can together give much more protection for freedom and equality of nations in the modern world.

An important report was today on the situation in Kherson region and in general, half -day countries, in our Dnieper after the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Elimination of the consequences of catastrophe, assistance to people, providing drinking and all other sensitive and important issues. Government Schmigal, Klimenko Minister of Internal Affairs, Profile Deputy Head of the Kuleb Office, representatives of local authorities. Another report is the situation in Kryvyi Rih Taodes after recent strikes of terrorists.

And, of course, the front. I thank all our soldiers, every unit, every boost brigade for today - for today's fighting.

I will note especially six units. The Khortytsia fell-paratroopers of our powerful 80th Separate Brigade of DShV. "Tavriya"-warriors of our 23rd separate mechanized brigade, Marines of the 35th and 37th separate brigades, warriors of the 128th-equally mountain-assault Transcarpathian brigade and the 128th separate brigade of Silro ... !For strength, courage, but that you return to Ukraine the Ukrainian land and strengthen our Ukrainian will.

Glory to everyone and everyone who is now in battle, at combat posts and at combat operations!Glory to all who train our warriors!Who treats and rehabilitates defects and defenders after injuries!

Thank you all in the world who helps. And, by the way, the next "Ramstein" today has been quite effective. We are still strong!

**Glory to Ukraine!**

The head of the Pentagon noted that damage to military equipment on the field is fighting, but the Russian side is distributing photos and videos, depicting "those self -apple cars almost a thousand times from ten different angles."

“As for the loss of technique: this is war. Yes, we know that the damage of Napoli battle will be on both sides. But it is important that Ukrainians have the opportunity to display damaged equipment, to repair where possible, and return this technique to the battle. And also that they have means to continue to move forward, ”Austin said at a briefing after meeting the contact group from Ukraine's defense in Brussels.

He stressed that the damage to military equipment will continue, but "if not, Ukrainians still have many combat capabilities." Lloyd Austin also asserted that, as expected, it was a "difficult battle", but he believes in the victory of Ukraine.

“African leaders attend not only Moscow at the end of the week, they now interfere in Kiev, and they received a very specific greeting - in the form of a large number of missile attacks - from [Putin](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin). I am sure, it will allow them to be aware of who is the aggressor, and how this aggressor behaves, what his realinators are, ”he said.

He stressed that the European Union congratulates any meaningful and serious one for peace, as no one wants peace more than Ukrainians. But for this we need to really speak with the victim of aggression.

“So it was a very good idea when African leaders arrived in Kiev, 1 year and four months after a full -scale invasion. It will be an opportunity to listen to the first hand of the position, prospects, to see the situation with your own eyes, ”the EU spokesman said.

This was assured of a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform member of the NBuvasil Furman Council.

Answering the question of the correspondent of Ukrinform, he predicted, for a long time [exchange](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obmin)The market to work as it was a few months ago, and asked people not to worry.

According to Furman, many myths have been associated with this issue, the main of which is the alleged ban on the exchange of notes in 1996.

“I called many banks - public and private, large and medium -sized banks - accepted and accepted such banknotes. There are no problems in this matter. Instead, the issues of interpretation of the degree of wear and tear are now actively working. This week, the NBU representatives talked to this week with the heads of non -bank financial institutions and banks.

“There will be no such as it was. The profitability of dollar deposits in large -scale Banking institutions is less than 1%, in average banks - 1-3%.

In one of our publications we _ [_ reported_](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/09/45-dniv-zamist-2-rokiv-vidteper-novitni-tehnologiyi-zaprovadzhuvatymut-u-zsu-znachno-shvydshe/)_, there are two dozen enterprises that have already passed all stages - from the submission of prohibition to operation - for one and a half months!It is about such terms that the accelerator team declares. That is, if an enterprise has a "mature" development in sphere arms and military equipment and wants the development to be used by VSKskh, now the whole process will take not years, but only 45 days.

The correspondent has decided to talk to one of these twenty businesses and to check whether it is really possible in such a short time. Agreed to talk Zarmiyainform representative of the manufacturer who already supplies to the troops shock Uak__phoenix 03 Heavy Ucav._

### ** “Actual work began in the last days of October. In December we got the cocks from the customer ”**

- We began to produce the prototype of our UAV in March last year. The final was completed in the summer of 2022. At the same time, our development was presented to the landfilling of the Ministry of Defense under the auspices of the Drone Army. They have shown how our drone can manage light armored equipment and air goals. And in October, the representatives of the Ministry of Defense were coming to the meeting. They voiced the needs of drones for our army. From that moment on our company has been accompanied by the representative of the Department of Military and Technical Policy, the development of weapons of the Tavi Taurian equipment of the Ministry of Defense,-said the representative of the manufacturer Anatoly.

Subsequently, his company transferred to the TTH Dron Defense Ministry.He confirms that the accelerator declared 45 days to pass the enterprise(company)The whole procedure for admission to development is quite real:

- From my experience, I will say that most of the time can take from the manufacturer who starts cooperation with the Ministry of Defense, the preparation of the package of necessary toxicity.

### ** Upon start of cooperation with Mow Country Number of Specialists on the Business Tri Fault **

Anatoly recalls that before the decision on cooperation with the Defense Ministry, his company has already produced several hundred of such drones.

- Some units have long passed our drones for the use of the VSI. Therefore, our team and our drone were, as they say, "mature." After applying to the Ministry of Defense, we were painted specialty representative offices after applying to the Ministry of Defense: what they should follow throughout the process. There were some 20 stages. We have voiced the questions about them, which we were clear at the beginning, and experts explained all of us, gave samples of documents that were to be filled, - the manufacturer said.

He notes that at the time of signing the contract with the DSSZZI, his company had 10 employees:

- At the time of signing the contract with the Defense Ministry - twice as much. And now the harbinger has increased three times ... Thanks to the well -established cooperation with the Ukrainian Ukraine managed to download production as much as possible. This made it possible to reduce the value of each drone by 30 %. Because we organized the optimal logistics route from the component supplier due to the planned volume of our purchases. It is a significant saving of funds for the state.

Anatoly specifies that his company now has a private investor.

- This, of course, facilitates the issue of purchasing components to drones. By the way, Ivinvestor was brought to us by the end consumer - those military who were given more than our drones, - says the company representative.

He notes that the production of drones began to take care of a large -scale invasion.

- We already had an understanding of this case - earlier our colleagues and I had a relationship with the prisoners through work in film production.

Anatoly adds that their design is a drone Kamikadze. Allen's request of our military enterprise additionally made the UAVSKACHANISM of the discharge of ammunition._Photo author_

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-16T54-00-00-04-00/foto-1-feldsher-maryna.jpg)_Marina, the paramedic of the battalion of the mechanized brigade "Cold Yar", from February 20122 to export the wounded from the battlefield on its already third ml-TB. The driver of them died during evacuation in the Kharkiv operation, the girl herself was only "only" with six contusions. He says everyone reacts in different ways: "One has torn off his leg, and he also calms me down, and some crying from scratch ricochet."

During our meeting, it turns out that calm and reasonable Feldhdhler has a formidable call sign "witch". In fact, he comes to the name with his name, and in general, the boys of the motor infantry battalion warmly speak about his combat physician warmly.

The name "combat physician" in relation to Marina is not for the red word. She worked on the evacuation of the wounded from the hell of the battles - from Izium Dovkhmut.

- I found out who we had the team command only when they came out. Before that, she was constantly on the road - from positions to a stabilization office, - says Marina.

Girl is a local one from the typical mining city Dimitrov _(Today, the Pokrovsky district of Donetsk region. - Ed.)_. The father was killed in the mine, the mother died before the war, a son, who lives in the city, a nearby renovated brigade. Maryna of her time was the Lavastiantyniv Medical School, so her knowledge was needed in the armed forces. After the beginning of Russian aggression, she concluded a contract and served as a nurse in the resuscitation of the Mariupol military hospital for two years. Clinics. Then it happened on December 24, 2022.

-Familiar guys were invited to the Mariupol Brigade, I came to them, and already on the 25th day she was mobilized,-Marina recalls. - Despite the fact that I was nursing, anesthesiology and intensive care, I worked as a prostimitarian instructor.

Marina spent the first 11 months of continuous battles in the district in the district, Trostyanets, Izium, then Bakhmut. He says that although the first wounded in 2016, he had to learn a lot during a large-scale invasion during a large-scale invasion."She handled," the boys tell us next to us. - Up to hundreds of people moved on herself.

According to Marina, she tried to do her work, no matter what: “It was so that they carry a wounded without half of the head, but he is still breathing - reanimation. I provide first aid, bring to a safe place from where others are erected and taken to a stabilization point. And then I know that he still dies… As the doctor you understand that he will not survive, he is already in agony, the plane is simply incompatible with life, but I perform my task in any way, my business is to keep them life on the field battle. After all, many of the guys are still "scraped"-they are taken out, connected to the IVL _(apparatus ventilation of the lungs. - Ed.)_, resuscitated, treated, put on their feet… ”

Usually, evacuation physicians themselves work literally under the bullets of shells. Marina shows her "Motoliga", which is hidden in the landlash of the oilmed point: “I already have two MT-LBs. Two mehvods _(mechanic-driver. –Aut.)_ - wounded, one - died under raisins. I was lucky, it took place only with contusions. "

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-16T54-00-00-04-00/foto-2-sanitarna-mashyna.jpg)Marina near the MT-LB sanitary machine: “In May they received, the cellar smelled. And now all in fragments, his tanks are punched ... "

-In August, we came out of Izium to Bakhmut, closed the exit as doctors, and apparently the Russians listened to our "rapeseed"(radio station. - Ed.), - mentioned. - They heard that we had to pick up the guys and at this time cover. There was a specific shelling. In the Motolizi hole is terrible, Mehvodu was ... I was lucky that I had time to hide in the dugout. Behu was faded, Nani was evacuated under fire. They thought they would now "disassemble" us. Alevives. I am told: "Marina, don't worry, it's just a small shrapnel, the elasticity of Mehvod will be good." But the artery interrupted ...

In general, during our conversation, Marina is not very eager to mention the moments of the service: "What can be found in the war?- Yes, everyone has their own pain threshold, but there are really boys patient, - Marina says. - Someone breaks his hand, a leg, a stopped belly, and he is "all right", he tries to reassure you .. And there is a scratch or a shrapnel out - he will cut a half car so that you have a skull - more than a helmet.

Now Marina is a paramedic of a mechanized battalion, a sergeant. She continues to quench the wounded, "intercepts" them literally on the forefront, but when the brigade is from the position of recovery, the doctor also has enough work.

-First, we work not only with our unit, we help everyone,-says Marina. - Our stABPNT works on a bunch of crews. If I open my journal where I write the wounded, then I don't even know half the brigades. And not only from the armed forces, there are border guards and others.

In addition, the battalion's medical center takes somatic patients("The back hurts, coughing-grows"-calls it Marina)and provides daily training in the field. Training, too, is accompanied by injuries or solic strokes and more.

I ask farewell, isn't it scary? “How scary?!Of course, scary ... - says Marina. - But the boys need to help. Well, who will do it!”

Concerning representatives of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, the special services of the Russian Federation prepare provocations. Such data of the SBU revealed during counterintelligence.

About this [it is referred](https://t.me/SBUkr/8654)In the report of the Ukrainian special service.

In particular, according to operational data, employees of the 5 FSB Service of the Russian Federation plan a series, which should include misinformation about the alleged Russian citizenship of Ukrainian statesmen, the leadership of the forces of defense and safety and their Germans, as well as other officials.

The "plausibility" and the evidence base of fakes, among other things, should provide:

* entry of the FSB in the State Registers of the Russian Federation of records that allegedly must confirm the version of hostile special services; * forgery of documents of Ukrainian statesmen and representatives of defense forces.

According to operational data, the start of the implementation of a hostile IPSO in the Ukrainian information field is scheduled for the near future.

Without success in the battlefield, the enemy seeks by any methods of undermining the psychological and emotional state of Ukrainian soldiers on the forefront and destabilizing the confidence in the country.

We urge representatives of the Ukrainian media to be critical of such "sensational" information. The SBU systematically monitors all such manipulations, exposes and delays the Kremlin agents, who deliberately help the enemy from the inside. We work together for the victory of Ukraine!

And even in the context of combat, military formations are to hone the skills of fighting. After all, the counter -offensive of the Ukrainian troops continues in the frontalidinamically and needs new knowledge and skills: in some areas, the counter -offensive of the Ukrainian troops is released - the town of Taselisch is released, and therefore fights in the urbanized area are ongoing, breakthroughs of the well -prepared defense of a well -prepared defense occur; Somewhere units are retaining active defense and destroying Russian invaders on the approaches to the position. Improve knowledge and skills to Ukrainian servicemen help the Western brothers.

Yes, in Kharkiv, Ukrainian military training is conducted(TDI). Організація була заснована незабаром післявеликої навали московитів в Україну. Її очільник — колишній рядовий одного збатальйонів Королівського полку Великої Британії Деніел Рідлі.

At the time of the cosrobial invasion, the serviceman was on vacation tanking in the occupied Russians, where he assisted the population and the trainees to provide domedic assistance. Daniel was already not turned into military service - he was defended by Mariupol, he could not restore the connection with his unit, and his contract with the Armed Forces soon ended.

- I have been living in Ukraine for 5 years, so I consider it to be my second homeland. Therefore, I decided that I would be able to help fight the invaders and without weapons in my hands. We have created Tridentdefense Initiative with other former NATO military personnel. Our instructors' team is highly qualified, we teach Ukrainian soldiers of the skills we acquired by participating in armed conflicts from Iran to Afghanistan and Syria. I would like to point out, this Volonta project - it is not sponsored by NATO, people are here on their own will of tamotivation.

Today, classes in the training camp are held at several training points: tactical medicine, tactics of combat in field and hubbanized area. In addition, foreign instructors teach the heads of operations planning.Rescue fighters instructors teach the ASM protocol(All Service MembersCourse)the CLS(Сombat Lifesavior Course)- how it is true to act in the "red" and "yellow" zone of hostilities, methods of evacuation of the wounded.

The winged and ballistic Russian missiles today showed Russia's real important attitude towards the restoration of peace, and to the world -leaders of the world trying to protect the world from aggression. Russia is a unified war and the only reason why the consequences of this war are harmful to the world, different peoples on all continents. No one can feel that their borders are protected, and the safety of their people is guaranteed until the Russians are being aggressive and theft of other people's lands with a global norm, ”the head of the Ukrainian state proclaimed.

He emphasized that the termination of Russian terror and the withdrawal of Russian troops throughout Ukraine is the only thing that can stop this war.

“Ukraine and the world need neither" frozen "conflicts nor wars. Peace is needed, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced.

“Food safety, radiation safety, safety of navigation, stability of the global markets and social peace in the world - all this is possible only when agression will not be and when the formula of peace will be realized. All nations of the world have been imprisoned to live freely, without the imposition of another's will by military Chipolitical way, ”the Head of State said.

He thanked all the participants of the meeting for supporting the principal integrity of states and the protection of nations from aggression.

The head of the Ukrainian state also noted that today the presidents, the leadership and the high representatives of African states visited Bucha in the Kyiv region and the consequences of the Russian occupation.

“Today, I urged the participants of our meeting to present my vision of how it is possible to overcome the consequences of Russia's crimes and prevent their repetition. In particular, it is a crime of mass deportation of Ukrainian children - they are presented from the occupied areas, they are kept in Russia, ”the President of Ukraine said.

During the negotiations, it was a Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant for people, the environment and infrastructure objects, in particular for the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, which Russian troops occupy already a lot and use as a cover for shelling of Ukrainian cities.

"Radiation does not know the borders between states and can reach any continent. It is more than the de-occupation of the Zaporozhye NPP and its return under Ukrainian control can guarantee reliable protection against radiation incidents at the station. Calling the participants of our meeting to present their vision of how to achieve this, the alien, which is interested in Russia, is an increase in the production of rockets for terror and novat against people and international order, against nature and the UN Charter, ”Vladimir Zelensky said.

He emphasized that any negotiations of Russia's leadership perceives the possible way to accumulate power and expand aggression, and Ukraine has already convinced it.

"I will point out again: a real peace is needed, and therefore, the real withdrawal of Russian from all our independent territory," the President said.

In addition, during the meeting, the parties discussed the food security of the world, in which Ukraine has already demonstrated its global power. Volodymyrzelensky presented to the participants of the negotiations the results of two export -initiatives: the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Humanitarian Program "Grain of Zokraine".

“We really help the world and specifically - many peoples of Africa, Asia, Europe to maintain social stability and price predictability of the export market through our exports. Together with our partners we work as a bubble in Africa. The supply of food must be securely guaranteed, and every person's right to food should be provided despite any states such as Russia, to use the threat of hunger and social nostability to blackmail peoples, ”the President said.

"We are ready to significantly expand educational programs for students, in particular from the country of Farican continent," said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“But first of all, we have to restore the full force of the UN Charter and stop the Russian aggression and liberate our land, our people of the Over -Russian Imperial Evil.

"Key-" Aircraft Coalition "formed-Denmark and the Netherlands will provide the preparation of our pilots on F-16 fighters. By July, a program will be ready, which will provide for a consistent training plan for our military. This is only the first one. Very soon we will see other countries that will join the coalition, ”the head of the Defense Office reported.

According to him, in addition to the "aircraft coalition" the issues of air defense, ammunition shells, artillery were discussed.

“Also important is my colleagues of Defense Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourgfransua Baush and the Minister of Defense of the Estonian Republic Hanno, Phonocvo, supported the idea of creating an IT Calioral. They are ready to take on the leadership role of creating this group. So, there is a new coalition on the horizon to ensure the winner of Ukraine, ”Oleksi Reznikov emphasized.

The declaration of intentions in the field of procurement of the BMP with the Czech and Slovak republics was signed. Details later. However, a step in cooperation between our countries is important.

"As a summary in the Ramstein format: today more than 50 countries are standing side by side with Ukraine, and I am grateful to Lloyd Austin for his leadership, as well as thank all our friends and partners for unspecified support," the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote.

According to him, the meeting of the Ukraine-Ukraine commission at the defense ministers is very important for us.“Now about the agenda. At the meeting of the Commission, Ukraine-NATO was key to the issue.

The first short -term is all that concerns the preparation for Vilnius' NATO's Summit, which will be held in July.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-16T91-00-00-04-00/354221582_707290668073954_3388152142321516294_n.jpg)We had the opportunity to convey our position and we expect that Ukraine would have a clear understanding of the Vilnia Summit: how and when we can become a member of the Alliance.

We also discussed how NATO can help us to establish medical rehabilitation of wounded soldiers who are now returning from the battlefield and who continue to go through a very serious way to return to a full life, ”the head of the Defense Department is reported.

According to Alexei Reznikov, another important area is the help of NATO defense purchases in Ukraine. We expect that the procurement agency will be able to help us build an effective and transparent procurement system that will allow you to use each hryvnia effectively. These are very practical things, we can now state that at this point we have prepared a very serious packet of practical steps, which will be presented at the Vilnius Sumiliders of NATO Member States.

"The second question was a further future: what to do to do, to abyigrand the security of Ukraine and all Europe after victory," - continues the Defense Minister of Ukraine.

Another direction of our work is joint defense planning. NATO's language will be a important tool that allows you to model the future:

* What should be the security system? * What should the army be? * What should be the defense?

Now, in real time, our defense planners together with NATO defense planners are working on models of the future.

According to him, we are already thinking about very practical tools that will help you become such a state in the future. For example, we are now coming to start a joint education and training center. I would call it the center of war with Russia. The idea is that we will share the difficult cost of the lessons from this war and use winged experience in order to become stronger.

“Our goal is to make Ukraine strong and be able to protect itself after winning. And that means - a strong army, which we call the army of the material. The Ukrainian army is the army of the future. And now we will go for it with partners, about long -term plans for the development of Ukrainian -military, ” - summed up the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.
