“The protected area is enshrined in the static document, at the legislative level, the Park's idiose, regardless of the name, must adhere to the regime of the territory of the decision. That is, there will be no "interesting" economic elements. Also, there are not immune to the "interesting" decisions of the powerful and people who love to look at the elections during the war. The protected area is an area where a person's intervention should be, ”said the cartilage.

Territorial threats to the park can be divided into two categories: illegal or contested in the courts of certain local self -government bodies or illegal decisions of state registrars for registration of real estate objects or land in the park. And the second category: it is a pure crime, you have a landing of land, ”said Pogrebsky.

 Badakenia exhumed 16 more bodies, so the death toll in the International Church "Good News" increased to 89.
As Ukrinform reports, it reports .
Kenya's authorities continue to exhumulate the bodies of people who, following the teachings of Pastorpol Mackenzie, have been hungry in the hope of meeting their creator.
Last week, the country's authorities arrested McKenzie, and now it remains in the coastal city of Malindi. No accusations have been made because the authorities require more time to complete the investigation.
At the same time, the prosecutor of Kenya Nurdin Hadzhi said on Monday that McKenzie would accuse of radicalization and terrorism.
Kenya, where the majority of the population constitute Christians, divides the state and church in the country, but increases the pressure on the control of the activity of some cordials and religious leaders.
The Kenya Government assured that Mackenzie and those who supported him would be held accountable for the death of his followers.

The last incident is not the first scandal around Ntene, which in 2017 and 2018 has been accused of radicalization of school -age children and maintenance at the expense obtained by the corruption. Human rights activists claim that the cult is engaged in illegal activities.

I want to remedy about the terrible situation on the spot for all the people who are now calling Domir. I also call for peace. But where were these calls when Russia is pulled on the borders? We need to understand very clearly what is happening. There is an aggressor that violated the UN Statute and invaded another country, and there is a victim of this aggression. We can take such a benevolent approach that states: "Oh, one is bad to stop, and the other does not want. Oh no!" It is impossible to put one level of the aggressor and aggressive, ”said Josep Borrel.

“Russia does not want to stop the invasion, and Ukraine must continue to defend. The all -right way to explain what is happening there.

“Having faced with a non-existent dialogue, NATO, as a political and military Alliance, should be ready to adjust its strategy on the go. For seventy -six years, this magazine, George Kennan, called for a policy of restraining the Doradian Union. Similar principles can be applied today, the vicious power, rigid sanctions, the isolation of Russia and the transatlantic unity with the eclipinal principles of our strategy, ”the authors of the article say.
The premieres of these countries emphasize that if Europe wants to remain holistic, American participation and leadership will remain decisive.
“However, the determination in support of Ukraine will also help contain aggression in other parts of the world, sending reports that tyrants do not calm whether LLC in Europe, asia, or anywhere else. This message will become especially clear, if Ukraine will win, and Russia will be defeated, ”the article reads.

 About it in interview The commander of the eastern group of troops was informed by Colonel-General Alexander.
-Indeed, Bakhmut remains the object of focusing the main efforts of Vorozhaz, among all other areas. For Russia, the East of Ukraine is the only part of the front where it has made at least some progress with the beginning of the "big offensive". The plan to win Ukraine in three days has transformed into nine -month attempts by a small city. After a series of defeats in the north and south of the Ukrainian -ownership, it is necessary to demonstrate at least the slightest success in the occupation of Donbass. Without mastering it, the invaders will not be able to develop the offensive in the direction of Kramatorsk and Siverskaya. Therefore, Russian propaganda provides battles for Bakhmut as a "battle for Stalingrad". They love such parallels. And in order to reach its goals, Russia will not regret human or material resources,-said Colonel-General Alexander Sirsky.

So, trying to show the advantage in the air, the enemy increased the number of aviation strikes, and moving to the tactics of group air strikes. That is, two aircraft released Ukrainian air defense, and the third struck.
Due to the improvement of weather conditions, the enemy doubled the number of use of unmanned aerial vehicles yesterday. First of all, the vows are said.
-Also yesterday there was a change in the use of the enemy Dronov-Kamikadze,-continues Alexei Dmitrashkivsky. - Yesterday afternoon, they first consided the Shahledi, which were well knocked down, but after the "Shahmed" appeared "lancets". This was also the purpose of identifying our points of antipyretic defense.

 The European Union is aware that the current crisis with the import of Ukrainian agricultural products to the ESUSE is caused by Russian aggression and will take all measures to solve it, based on the principles of solidarity with Ukraine.

“We had the honor of communicating with our Ukrainian colleague Nicholas Solsky, who participated in a videoconference at the beginning of the meeting. The participation of the Ukrainian minister helped to concentrate our thoughts on what really matters.
He acknowledged that there are problems in the EU's internal market, especially in those countries that border Ukraine. In this connection, he emphasized the need to carry out a thorough analysis of the impact that the Ukrainian agricultural imports committed on the market situation. Today, according to him, the EU Radaminist has expressed solid support not only for Ukraine, but also for the neighboring EU countries.

In turn, the European Commissioner for Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski has argued that the European Commission is fully understanding the concern of five states in connection with excessive production of products from Ukraine, which creates many problems for farmers. The European Commission is negotiating with the governments of these countries to work out the problem.
"This situation is 100% caused by Russian unprovured, criminal -justified aggression against Ukraine, which has a consequence for the market, for the food system and for increasing imports, above all, grain, from Ukraine to the European Union," the European Commissar said.He recalled that before the war on the basis of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine Import of major agricultural goods was free from and restrictions, including rapeseed seeds. But the actual import of these products to Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary was very insignificant. Everything changed when the war began. As a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the grain record of 2021 was actually blocked.
“It was the reason why grain in Ukraine was very cheap, and many traders of the Zevrian Union, especially in border countries, purchased grain in Ukraine. Import of grain(in the EU - ed.)In 2022, compared to 2021, it increased from € 7 billion to € 13 billion. The whole volume of increasing imports from the "frontier" state of the EU, "said Janusz Voitsekhovsky.
He noted that the EU countries are close to the decision to pay these states the second aid from the Reserve Agricultural Fund, which was increased from the initial proposal of € 100 million to € 150 million. This money is planned to be directed to support farmers in five countries who have lost their loss with a decline in food prices in the domestic market. The first time, which has already been highlighted, is € 56 million.

This has caused damage to the farms, first of all, in countries bordering Ukraine.
After the beginning of Russian aggression against Ukraine and blocking the Black Sea ports, through which it was usually made exports of agricultural products to the world market, the European Union organized "corridors of solidarity" on the borders with Ukraine to direct part of its farm exports to the world market, with the use Also, more than 32 million tons of grain and other agricultural goods were imported in the course of the year.
