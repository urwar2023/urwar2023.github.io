Minireintegration [cite](https://minre.gov.ua/2023/04/23/algorytmy-dij-dlya-rodyn-znyklyh-bezvisty/)The most common questions:

* Interaction of families disappeared with territorial centers of equipment and social support. * How to get information about the investigator who conducts criminal proceedings. * Registration of money of the missing person. * How to get an excerpt from the Unified Register of Pre -trial Investigations.

The Ministry of Reintegration has prepared algorithms for the most pressing issues. Algorithms were developed on the basis of requests received on the hot lines of the missing person.

The target for terrorists was the museum of local lore and adjacent houses. Rossia killed this blow of two women. My condolences to my relatives and loved ones ... Ten people were injured - they are given the necessary help.

In total, more than 60 museums and galleries in different areas of our country are so self -destroyed or damaged by the occupier.

Today, in the Kherson region, the blow of Russian aviation was destroyed. In the village of Kizomis, the Belozersky community. Orthodox temple ... managed by theuaabomb. That is, the Russian military knew that they were destroying. This church has been one of the hundreds of churches and prayer houses broken by Russian blows.

Crimea ... Today, the invaders broke into the house of Abdureshit Jepparova. He is the single representatives of the Crimean Tatar national movement, human rights activist, citizen of Ukraine. Where he is now, which is unknown to him. This is another example of the Crimea's indigenous people, against all our people. Those and thousands of such examples during aggression in the Crimea and in other regions occupied by Russia.

No one can feel safe anywhere until the aggressor is broken. This is the day in Ukraine proves - all that Russian troops and special services are doing on our land against our people. And this is that they dream of bringing other peoples on the ground. The whole world knows it.

The world also knows: Russia can be stopped. This is a common interest. Stop the powerful soldiers on the front line. Our weapons - both Ukrainian and the one we make from partners.

The first such sanction plan was fulfilled by more than 70%. Therefore, the infected with what directions it is possible to increase the sanction pressure and how to give a more stability due to the complete exclusion from the global relations of all deestructive Russian entities, all those who work for the war.

This sanction document will be on the tables with all key leaders in the world - both political and public, business. Sanctions against the Russian Naptogaza Sector, against the nuclear industry, against absolutely everyone who helps Russia to circumstance. This is necessary self -defense of international order.

Today I held the next meeting. Commanders, Head, Intelligence, Ministry of Defense. Reports on hostilities on the front are now actively moving, the equipment of new units. The Ramstein and further communication with our partners have been separate today.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-fears-more-starvation-cult-victims-as-search-resumes/7064963.html).

Kenya's authorities continue to exhumulate the bodies of people who, following the teachings of Pastorpol Mackenzie, have been hungry in the hope of meeting their creator.

Last week, the country's authorities arrested McKenzie, and now it remains in the coastal city of Malindi. No accusations have been made because the authorities require more time to complete the investigation.

At the same time, the prosecutor of Kenya Nurdin Hadzhi said on Monday that McKenzie would accuse of radicalization and terrorism.

Kenya, where the majority of the population constitute Christians, divides the state and church in the country, but increases the pressure on the control of the activity of some cordials and religious leaders.

The Kenya Government assured that Mackenzie and those who supported him would be held accountable for the death of his followers.

People who were involved in the good news documents believed that they would fall into heaven if they kill themselves.

Church leader Paul McKenzie Ntene called his followers to starve Ustromy to "meet Jesus." He is in custody in anticipation of the court. It is considered that some of his fans can still hide the inserts around the shackhalo.

The last incident is not the first scandal around Ntene, which in 2017 and 2018 has been accused of radicalization of school -age children and maintenance [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-cerkva)at the expense obtained by the corruption.

About it at a press conference in Ukrinform in the format of the video, the head of the National Park Andrei Khryutba, who is now located in the Armed Forces, said.

“The protected area is enshrined in the static document, at the legislative level, the Park's idiose, regardless of the name, must adhere to the regime of the territory of the decision. That is, there will be no "interesting" economic elements. Also, there are not immune to the "interesting" decisions of the powerful and people who love to look at the elections during the war. The protected area is an area where a person's intervention should be, ”said the cartilage.

Also in Parkzazazauristed 22 thousand species of vertebrates and invertebrates, of which the large part is listed in the Red Book.

“This is a very brief description of what is called biodiversity, what retains and restores the Holosiivsky National Park. The preservation of this natural rise is the main task of the protected area. Nature is also preserved in other functional areas, but the protected area is key to preserving a variety, ”Arustamyan emphasized.

This year, the project of reorganization of the territory of the territory of the nationist National Park was approved, where the protected area will be 38%.

At the same time, as the Wildlife Defender Mikhailopogrebsky noted at the press conference, the Holosiivskyi National Park needs constant protection, given that there are threats to its territorial integrity.

"On the one hand we are happy to increase the protected area with the most strict regime(Regarding economic activity - ed.)On the other, we run the risk of getting the huge arrays of the National Park. Territorial threats to the park can be divided into two categories: illegal or contested in the courts of certain local self -government bodies or illegal decisions of state registrars for registration of real estate objects or land in the park. And the second category: it is a pure crime, you have a landing of land, ”said Pogrebsky.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-25T16-28-21-03-00/1682429195-722.jpg)As an example, he cited the Belichansky Forest, where there are territorial claims from the side of the Kiev region on part of the territory of the National Park, in particular the decision of the Buschansky settlement council on the expansion of Kotsyubynsky networks by 23 thousand hectares. The activist's foundations, 80% of this territory are the Holosiivskyi National Park. In addition, the Belicansky forest by the decision of the Kyiv Regional Council is included in the boundaries of perspective development of the Kyiv region, which carries the risks of building natural terminations.

The National Park also contains cases of self -capture of land, and the previous cultivation of the National Park has made illegal recreational agreements with the entities that have seized the areas and a number of other threats to capture.

In turn, the representative of the Holosiivsky National Nature Park Oleggodin noted that the National Park had already prepared several petitions for expanding the territory, one of them has already been approved by Mindovquil.

Ухвалений закон – про можливості длямаксимально швидкого відновлення авіасполучення, як тільки це дозволитьбезпекова складова», - наголосили в міністерстві.

Документ спрощує процедури видачі сертифіката льотної придатності і дозволу навиконання польотів для окремих імпортованих в Україну повітряних суден.

Тобто, якщо літак сертифіковано в Європейській агенції безпеки авіації (EASA), then you do not need to re -certify in Ukraine.

In addition, Ukrainian air carriers now do not need to receive the rights of air lines to perform regular air transportation in the country and abroad. Just as for charter transportation in Ukraine. Obtaining a similar permit is not provided in the EU countries, said the ministry.

This opinion was expressed by the director of the Institute of World Policy, Eugene Magda Nazidani, a roundtable on the topic: "Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus as a child of European security," Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"To date, Russia by the decision on the placement of tactical nuclear weapons of Belarus performs a hybrid offensive surgery. It carries a nuclear ARSENAL for several hundred kilometers to the west, using the so -called Billerian Balcon , .. And largely translates responsibility to Lukashenko, "Magda said.

"Putin does not confirm such steps and indicates that Russia is a lot of terms of non -proliferation of nuclear weapons. We understand that Russia is indicative of compliance with the terms of basic treaties in the realm of international law is an element of forming its image. Therefore, in this case, Belarus is threatened with the threat of nuclear weapons, including from its territory, "the expert said.

In his opinion, Putin is very interested in the internationalization of Russian-Ukrainian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna).

"I believe that the desire to threaten the expansion of the war territory in one way or another responses to the Russian interests, because the Kremlin emphasizes that it is leading war, the widow side, against NATO, on the other hand, the war is not in Russian territory. At least at an ideological level, that Russia calls a special military operation, in the format of the world, " - said the director of the Institute of World Policy.As reported by Ukrinform, on March 25, the President of the aggressor country Volodymyrputin, for whom the ISS issued a warrant for arrest, said that Russia is to place tactic nuclear weapons in Belarus. Earlier, in February this year, he announced the "suspension" of Moscow's participation in the treaty to reduce strategic -seized weapons from the United States.

About this Obama [](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1650862300289720326)On the official tweet, Ukrinform reports.

“I am proud of the fact that Joe Biden and his administration have been fulfilled in the last few years. He advocated the American people, and he will continue to do so when he is re -echoed, ”the former President -Democrat stressed.

Obama wrote this comment to a video which Joe [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bajden)He made public on Tuesday with a statement that he would participate in the Presidential race.

Democrats believe that in the event of Donald Trump's victory on Primers, Joe Biden may become the only opponent to win him.

However, there are significant reservations about the age of the present presidential: he should be 82 years old in 2024, and if he converted, he will be touched by the country up to 86 years of age. Even during the 2020 elections, Joe Baiden's age was one of the main counter -arguments on the part of his superintendents.

Maybe because of this, he and his team have long evaded the direct answers to the intentions to go to the second presidential term. However, two months ago, in one of the TV interpretation, Lady Jill Biden said she would support the man's decision.

He stated this during an online output at an EU Council meeting on agriculture and fishing, Ukrinform reports with reference to [](https://minagro.gov.ua/news/mikola-solskij-na-radi-yes-z-pitan-silskogo-gospodarstva-yevropa-potrebuye-ukrayinskogo-zerna-kukurudzi-shrotu-ta-inshoyi-produkciyi).

Solsky noted that Europe requires Ukrainian grain, corn, meal and other products, and Ukrainian goods are useful for the European market. In particular, Ukrainian imports to Poland have brought a lot of benefits not only to Ukraine, but also by Samipolshi, which increased the export of meat and dairy products by 37%last year.

So, the neighboring country grew, using Ukrainian raw materials in that number. In particular, in 2022, chicken production in Poland increased by 8.2%compared to 2021. Poland has become one of the EU leaders in chicken to chicken in third countries, ”the minister said.

He added that in the first quarter of 2023 Poland sold 10.5 thousand tons of chicken in Ukraine, and Ukraine of Poland - 4 thousand tons, which is 2.5 times less.

Livestock livestock in Germany, the Netherlands and other leaders. Traders, carriers of TAPORTS also earn on Ukrainian grain.

According to the minister, Ukrainian grain was not a key cause of market pricing. Solsky explained that in the last two months the quotations have fallen in spite of the expectations of farmers of all countries not through Ukrainian grain, but a very large crop from Brazil.

This factor presses on the markets, perhaps more than exports from Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian minister.

«Ми бачимо стрімке зростання обсягів бразильського виробництва і експорту, щопри повільно зростаючому попиті суттєво тисне на ціни. Ми щиро раді за колегіз Південної Америки, але невже, виходячи з останнього досвіду, тепер требазакрити можливості експорту і Бразилії, аби світові ціни знову розвернулися всторону зростання?» - зауважив очільник Мінагрополітики.

Сольський нагадав, що українські аграрії працюють у надскладних умовах війни,але розуміють проблеми колег за кордоном. Водночас він акцентував на тому, щоосновна причини нинішньої кризи - повномасштабна війна, розв'язана росією.

«Проблеми фермерів у європейських країнах - це не вина українських фермерів. Іпершопричина такої ситуації на європейському ринку - не в ціні українськогозбіжжя, а у війні, яку розв'язала росія проти України. Ця війна, нагадаю,триває вже дев'ять років. З яких ми переживаємо другий рік страшного іцинічного терору, знищення всього українського з боку російського агресора», -підкреслив міністр.

At the same time, the minister expressed the hopeful decision of the European Commission.

“We emphasize once again that the opinion and position of our clerks are extremely important to us. And that great support we received and receive. We have a single, because there is always a discussion between real friends, and at the same time they always find a solution, ” - summed up the head of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy.

«Підготовка цього документу забрала 4 місяці дуже інтенсивної роботи в рамкахКомітетів з питань промисловості, із закордонних справ та підкомітету з питаньоборони й безпеки. EDIRPA – це не лише гроші для закупівлі зброї, але такожінструмент для посилення співробітництва між країнами-членами навколоспільного замовлення. Ми знаємо про критичну ситуацію, яку виявила війна вУкраїні. Головне завдання на майбутнє - посилити європейську обороннупромисловість. В цій трагічній ситуації ми маємо поповнювати наші склади тапідтримувати ефективний захист України», - зазначив з цього приводуКраснодембський.

Він зауважив, що сьогоднішнє голосування відобразило спільне розуміннянинішньої ситуації більшістю депутатів, що дозволяє шукати спільні рішення.Депутат висловив сподівання, що переговори щодо запропонованого законодавчогоакту за участю Ради ЄС та Єврокомісії проходитимуть конструктивно.

Своєю чергою депутат Галер назвав сьогоднішнє рішення навколо EDIRPA«історичним моментом для європейської оборони».

This is not only urgently necessary for the sake, but it should have been made for a long time, ”the German MP said.“Even worse - Europe has to prepare much more intense geopolitical competition, as well as tension. Competitive hostility is not necessary to threaten our opponents, but to restrain them, to protect our values and interests, the international rule -based international order, and the safety and welfare of our citizens. Self -citizens call us to this, ”Galer emphasized.

According to the deputy, in 2007, the member states have taken to invest 35 percent of defense expenses in joint projects.

Finally, the third reason is the need to strengthen European defense and defense industry. One of the tools of this is the recently created European Defense Fund that allows you to combine the efforts of defensive companies of cutting EU countries together. It is a quality strengthening of such work, when the Member States will only be able to place their own orders, but also to formulate a business request for the production of military equipment and weapons. Such an approach will be an incentive for economic development and more efficient use of taxpayers, will increase the level of mutual mutual substitution between the armed forces of different European countries.

“Today we have made the first and rather small step in this direction. I wanted to not need to come before the war in Europe to get to such understanding. But it is better to do it later than never, ”the German politician said.

Another important provision of the document is the requirement for the European Commission to reduce EU dependence on external suppliers in the field of defense.

EU countries have reported that Ukraine has made 1 million chips during the year. For this purpose, 1 billion euros have already been allocated for the supply of ammunition from existing arsenals. Another billionaire is allocated for the production of 155 mm caliber shells for Ukraine's defense industry enterprises(Discussions around the location of such ordering is still ongoing).

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-fears-more-starvation-cult-victims-as-search-resumes/7064963.html).

Kenya's authorities continue to exhumulate the bodies of people who, following the teachings of Pastorpol Mackenzie, have been hungry in the hope of meeting their creator.

Last week, the country's authorities arrested McKenzie, and now it remains in the coastal city of Malindi. No accusations have been made because the authorities require more time to complete the investigation.

At the same time, the prosecutor of Kenya Nurdin Hadzhi said on Monday that McKenzie would accuse of radicalization and terrorism.

Kenya, where the majority of the population constitute Christians, divides the state and church in the country, but increases the pressure on the control of the activity of some cordials and religious leaders.

The Kenya Government assured that Mackenzie and those who supported him would be held accountable for the death of his followers.

People who were involved in the good news documents believed that they would fall into heaven if they kill themselves.

Church leader Paul McKenzie Ntene called his followers to starve Ustromy to "meet Jesus." He is in custody in anticipation of the court. It is considered that some of his fans can still hide the inserts around the shackhalo.

The last incident is not the first scandal around Ntene, which in 2017 and 2018 has been accused of radicalization of school -age children and maintenance [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-cerkva)at the expense obtained by the corruption. Human rights activists claim that the cult is engaged in illegal activities.

No one can feel safe anywhere until the aggressor is broken. This is the day in Ukraine proves - all that Russian troops and special services are doing on our land against our people. And this is that they dream of bringing other peoples on the ground. The whole world knows it.

The world also knows: Russia can be stopped. This is a common interest. Stop the powerful soldiers on the front line. Our weapons - both Ukrainian and the one we make from partners. By the power of law, that is, sanctions that need constant strengthening, as well as our joint work for the sake of justice. The manifestation of Russian terror, every day of aggression - these are additional arguments that all this should end in the tribunal - in the new Nuremberg on Rashism, relative And people who have rockets against museums, and managed avaibombs - against churches.Today, our international sanction group, a group of experts headed by Andriyermak and Michael McFol, presented a document on strengthening sanctions against Russia. The first such sanction plan was fulfilled by more than 70%. Therefore, the infected with what directions it is possible to increase the sanction pressure and how to give a more stability due to the complete exclusion from the global relations of all deestructive Russian entities, all those who work for the war.

This sanction document will be on the tables with all key leaders in the world - both political and public, business. Sanctions against the Russian Naptogaza Sector, against the nuclear industry, against absolutely everyone who helps Russia to circumstance. This is necessary self -defense of international order.

Today I held the next meeting. Commanders, Head, Intelligence, Ministry of Defense. Reports on hostilities on the front are now actively moving, the equipment of new units. The Ramstein and further communication with our partners have been separate today.

He also held a meeting on the economic restoration of Ukraine. Shmigal, Sviridenko, Shurma, Kubrakov, Fedorov - our restore team. Presented the economic experiment of today and post -war period. It is already clear that the result of a more victory will be the opportunity of Ukraine to be a real supplier of security to all our partners, for all in the world, who appreciates the international order based on the rules. The new safety standards that we embody in our lives: in our infrastructure, energy, logistics and communication, in the social and educational spheres, in our production - all this can be scale in other parts of the world.

Similarly, Ukrainian protection systems, our weapons, our experience of our people, acquired in the confrontation of Russian terror. All this will work on Global, so that no one in the world has ever repeated Russian crimes.

Glory to every warrior who is now in battle, in combat posts, at combat operations!Separately, I want to celebrate today the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade.

“By organizing these debates in the Radbeza, Russia tries to show itself as a defender of the UN status and multilaterality. Nothing can be far from truth. Cincinically.

The international community should remain firmly committed to the responsibility for the crimes committed in and against Ukraine.

On this [emphasized](https://twitter.com/GLandsbergis/status/1650511286180933641)The Glavasic Political Office of Lithuania Gabrielus Landsbergis.

“We are NATO members, Article 5 protects us and guarantees that we will not be amazed. The events in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014, and the current imposition of the Russian Federation in Ukraine really shows that NATO can protect the countries that know this side of the border, ”Gabrielus Landsbergis reminded.

According to him, the same Russian tanks that shot unarmed not guilty of the civilians of Lithuania, who tried to defend the country liberated in 1991, are now killing Ukrainians.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister reminded that in two months in Vilnius [will take place](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/11/09/nastupnyj-samit-nato-vidbudetsya-vlitku-2023-roku-v-lytvi/)The NATO Summit, and the holdings of the capital, which is so close to Russia and Belarus, is a landmark.

“I do not believe that Ukraine has a future without NATO, and I do not believe that NATO is a capacious without Ukraine. If we want Europe and the North Atlantic to be safe or protected, we should include countries that are confronted with a ration from Russia. We have already said that Russia is a fundamental strategic threat to the North Atlantic Alliance. That is why all countries that are highly threatened should be together, they must be protected together in order to restrain any future aggression, ”Gabrielus Landsbergis stressed.

About this [it is referred](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/free-world-must-stay-course-ukraine)In a joint article by the Czech Prime Ministers, Peter Fali, Slovakia Edward Heger and Poland Mateusha Moravtsky in Foreignaffairs.

“Having faced with a non-existent dialogue, NATO, as a political and military Alliance, should be ready to adjust its strategy on the go. For seventy -six years, this magazine, George Kennan, called for a policy of restraining the Doradian Union. Similar principles can be applied today, the vicious power, rigid sanctions, the isolation of Russia and the transatlantic unity with the eclipinal principles of our strategy, ”the authors of the article say.

The premieres of these countries emphasize that if Europe wants to remain holistic, American participation and leadership will remain decisive.

“However, the determination in support of Ukraine will also help contain aggression in other parts of the world, sending reports that tyrants do not calm whether LLC in Europe, asia, or anywhere else. This message will become especially clear, if Ukraine will win, and Russia will be defeated, ”the article reads.

-Indeed, Bakhmut remains the object of focusing the main efforts of Vorozhaz, among all other areas. For Russia, the East of Ukraine is the only part of the front where it has made at least some progress with the beginning of the "big offensive". The plan to win Ukraine in three days has transformed into nine -month attempts by a small city. After a series of defeats in the north and south of the Ukrainian -ownership, it is necessary to demonstrate at least the slightest success in the occupation of Donbass. Without mastering it, the invaders will not be able to develop the offensive in the direction of Kramatorsk and Siverskaya. Therefore, Russian propaganda provides battles for Bakhmut as a "battle for Stalingrad". They love such parallels. And in order to reach its goals, Russia will not regret human or material resources,-said Colonel-General Alexander Sirsky.

Live Air(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news" was said by a spokesman for the eastern grouping of armed force troops Colonel Sergey Cherevaty.

- In Bakhmut, the situation is dynamic, it changes from time to time, because a position war is ongoing, - he says. - We do everything as possible to inflict the lesion, maneuvering, we use all the available means of damage. The enemy also concentrates his efforts on Bakhmut - in fact, in our operating room, there is no such powerful fighting anywhere else.

Over the past day, the enemy has attacked our positions on the Bakhmut Napryamka, 280 times struck various types of artillery, performed 4 Avhalts. Only in Bakhmut area there were 85 shelling and 20 combatants. As a result of the fighting, 175 invaders were destroyed and 213 were injured. The enemy T-72 tank was shot down, four combat drifts, three MSTA-B guns, five unmanned aerial vehicles, a single-electronic wrestling one, as well as four field deposits.

According to Colonel Sergei Cherevatov, for the whole period of defense of Bakhmutu -Ukrainian defenders have already destroyed tens of thousands of Russians.

- I think, over time, our military analysts will name the exact figures, but the loss is huge here, - says the officer. - As for the criminal group "Wagner", it is no longer able to perform combat tasks on its own, which has been done earlier, actually monopolizing this direction. Although the "Wagnerivtsi" is the main force that attacks, the Russians in the Bakhmut direction, they can no longer act without the help of a regular army. The more ashable units of the troops of the invaders, the units of special purposes are increasingly used, so we understand that the loss of the enemy is very significant as Wagner is probably the final border.

Live broadcast [TEMACHORFON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The only news is the head of the united Press Center of Defense forces of Tavriysky, Colonel Alexei Dmitryashkivsky noted that the enemy began to start his artillery component again.

- The enemy firets our positions with almost the same intensity as Tsybul in February, - says the officer. - In yesterday and today, the enemy has almost 500 each position from different artillery systems.

Alexei Dmitrashkivsky told about the assault actions, the enemy 22 times healed the positions of our troops. It happened in the Marinka area, which the enemy was not at attempts to capture to block Avdiivka.

Also, the head of the united Press Center of Defense Forces of Tavriyskaya direction was that yesterday the enemy changed his tactics. So, trying to show the advantage in the air, the enemy increased the number of aviation strikes, and moving to the tactics of group air strikes. That is, two aircraft released Ukrainian air defense, and the third struck.

Due to the improvement of weather conditions, the enemy doubled the number of use of unmanned aerial vehicles yesterday. First of all, the vows are said.

-Also yesterday there was a change in the use of the enemy Dronov-Kamikadze,-continues Alexei Dmitrashkivsky. - Yesterday afternoon, they first consided the Shahledi, which were well knocked down, but after the "Shahmed" appeared "lancets". This was also the purpose of identifying our points of antipyretic defense.

The officer also told about the deterioration of the moral and psychological state of the avalanche, and the news in the Tavriya direction. Yes, he noted that in the recent information about the arrival in the area of Avdiivka of the new tanking unit of the occupying army, it has not shown itself at all, and for the attacks of our positions the enemy uses the fourth day in a row exclusively infantry. Oleksiy Dmitrashkivsky may assume, this is due to the fact that the opponent is not so much selected to use this technique as to demonstrate the effect of its precision.

And in the carbon direction, as the head of the united press center told, a broken enemy of the 155th Brigade of Marine Corps appeared again. However, it is unlikely that it could fully restore the combat capability in such compisormins.

The Security Service systematically exposes collaborators to help aggressor Russian education programs in temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine.

As a result of comprehensive measures, 11 more teachers reported suspicion of fertile cooperation with the invaders.

Among them are the heads of captured Ukrainian schools and education departments.

Thus, in Donetsk the "director" of one of the secondary educational institutions of the Novoazov district was identified.

She called for graduates to join Russian universities and in the future to "devote themselves" to work in favor of the aggressor country.

In addition, the former teacher was exposed in Mariupol, who after the capture of the city supported the invaders and offered them their help in spreading the Kremliv regime.

For this she was appointed "Deputy Director" of School No. 26.

One of its first decisions in the "position" is the destruction of all Ukrainian textbooks that were in the library of the educational institution.

The criminal activity of the head of the Mariupol Education Department was also documented.

According to the investigation, she accepted "reports" from the heads of local educational institutions on the organization of the educational process according to Russian "standards".

Currently, these and other persons have reported suspicion of collaboration.

With regard to four of them, security investigators have completed pre -trial investigations and plan to send indictments to court.

In all exposed facts, complex measures are underway to hold the guilty responsibility for crimes against our country.

The investigation was carried out by SBU staff in Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the procedural leadership of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office.

The head of the Presidential Office told this during online meetings with representatives of the expert and media environment.

Andriy Yermak explained that the plan of action to strengthen sanctions against Russia, which the international expert group presented last year, became the basis for the introduction of important sanctions.

“The documents of our group today lie on the tables of all world leaders and all those who are sanctioned. I am proud that today the development of our group is the basis of more than 70% of sanctions that have been implemented and implemented in the EU, the United Kingdom and other countries, ”he said.

Andriy Yermak stressed that through the work of the group, embargo naproots and petroleum products were introduced, the price limits on them, the full blocking of approximately against the 20 largest Russian banks, as well as Russia, and all rights in FATF were subject to Russia. In addition, a widespread list of dual -use goods, impedable sanctions on thousands of persons from different spheres, has been imposed under trade restrictions, coordinating mechanism of implementation of "Greater Seven" sanctions was created.

“Almost everything from the foreground was implemented. I would like to thank all Ukrainians. Sanctions are a strong weapon with which we defend our Ukraine and which we will win the aggressor, ”he said.

The head of the head of state said that the International Working Group has presented a new plan for sanctions - Action Plan 2.0.

“We expect new powerful sanctions packages provided for in this plan. This is an extremely important document, and I thank everyone who participated in its development, ”said Andriy Yermak.

He stressed that the new plan should be as soon as possible to the world leaders and the relevant organizations that take care of the issues of sanctions. Andriy Yermak also marked the importance of imposing sanctions on Russian athletes whom the aggressor country uses as a tool for promoting his war.Ambassador Michael McFol emphasized that, despite the considerable amount of work performed by the sanction struggle, many work still needs to be realized. It was on these areas that experts in the process of preparation of the updated plan focused. The suggested directions of the sanctioning way are very specific. It is about the most painful points of the Russian economy, in which it should be pressed to reduce Russia's potential for hostilities. In particular, Mr Macfol emphasized the importance of further implementation of the sanction over the energy complex of the Russian Federation and the defense industry, the restriction of the use of financial instruments, the confiscation of assets of the central bank of Russia and their transmission to Ukraine, as well as other areas, reflected in the plan.

According to him, the sanctions regime should be strengthened, and the new document shows how they can be implemented in relation to the aggressor country.

This was stated in Luxembourg during the Press Conference on the results of the Council of Ministers of the ESEZ Agriculture and fisheries by the representative of Sweden Agrarian Agrarian Exercise, Peter Kulgren, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We had the honor of communicating with our Ukrainian colleague Nicholas Solsky, who participated in a videoconference at the beginning of the meeting. The participation of the Ukrainian minister helped to concentrate our thoughts on what really matters.

He acknowledged that there are problems in the EU's internal market, especially in those countries that border Ukraine. In this connection, he emphasized the need to carry out a thorough analysis of the impact that the Ukrainian agricultural imports committed on the market situation. Today, according to him, the EU Radaminist has expressed solid support not only for Ukraine, but also for the neighboring EU countries.

We need to respond to the strictness as the European Union. The EU continues to maintain unity in the solidarity of Zauzina, and intends to find a solution that will not compromise solidarity with our neighbor, ” - said the representative of the Swedish presidency of the European Union.

In turn, the European Commissioner for Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski has argued that the European Commission is fully understanding the concern of five states in connection with excessive production of products from Ukraine, which creates many problems for farmers. The European Commission is negotiating with the governments of these countries to work out the problem.

"This situation is 100% caused by Russian unprovured, criminal -justified aggression against Ukraine, which has a consequence for the market, for the food system and for increasing imports, above all, grain, from Ukraine to the European Union," the European Commissar said.He recalled that before the war on the basis of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine Import of major agricultural goods was free from [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tarif)and restrictions, including rapeseed seeds. But the actual import of these products to Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary was very insignificant. Everything changed when the war began. As a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the grain record of 2021 was actually blocked.

“It was the reason why grain in Ukraine was very cheap, and many traders of the Zevrian Union, especially in border countries, purchased grain in Ukraine. Import of grain(in the EU - ed.)In 2022, compared to 2021, it increased from € 7 billion to € 13 billion. The whole volume of increasing imports from the "frontier" state of the EU, "said Janusz Voitsekhovsky.

He noted that the EU countries are close to the decision to pay these states the second aid from the Reserve Agricultural Fund, which was increased from the initial proposal of € 100 million to € 150 million. This money is planned to be directed to support farmers in five countries who have lost their loss with a decline in food prices in the domestic market. The first time, which has already been highlighted, is € 56 million.
