<p>This was reported in a comment to the Ukrinform correspondent in the Hague in the ECtHR Authorized Affairs Margarita Sokorenko.</p>
<p>“In accordance with the ECtHR Prescribe, the decision should be published on July 18, 2023 on the site, which houses all its decisions. Therefore, it will be written, not as in previous interstate cases - with a public pronouncement. In principle, it is logical, given the history of Russia's claim to the ECtHR, and the refusal of the Russian Federation to cooperate with the court since March 2022, ”she said.</p>
<p>Sokorenko also expressed the expectation that the result in this case is comforting.</p>
<p>“For me, this lawsuit is about the alternative version of Russia's aggression against our state. In short, they declared a number of human rights violations, first of all, the Russian -speaking population, talking about discrimination of andutis. I can only evaluate Ukraine's chances in this case, and, as for me, the result will please, ”the ECtHR Commissioner for Affairs said.</p>

<p>“Almost every month we see new decisions in individual matters of Russian citizens, in which the ECtHR states quite stringent violations. By the way, this week, an important decision in the case of Nemtsov Anti -President was made at the request in February 2015. The ECtHR pointed to a number of shortcomings and problems in the investigation of Nemtsov's murder, "Sokorenko said.</p>
<p>In addition, she noted, the ECtHR has intensified in interstate cases “Ukraine's opposite of(As for Crimea)”And“ Ukraine and the Netherlands v. The descended procedural steps will take place in the fall of this year, noted.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-14T48-00-00-04-00/12-8.jpg" />Every day we hear about the need to "stay". But do we understand this ZAZKLIK? After all, restraining the feelings, on the contrary we exhale our body.</p>
<p>War is daily challenges for our psyche and emotional stability. We live the sounds of sirens, constant erection from the front, grueling expectations and vibrations of plants - despair, despair, anger, fatigue, hope. What to do with all these people? Often they are so untimely and seem unnecessary. There are three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>notice emotions in the moment("Oh, I'm angry");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To accept them("Everything ok, it's okay, I know how to handle it");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>live them constructively(“Jogging will help to spill anger”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Що означає «прожити конструктивно»? Не завдати шкоди собі чи людям навколо.Тобто спрямувати енергію злості, розпачу, агресії чи болю в якусь дію, якавивільняє цю енергію екологічно: танці, спорт, терапія криком, малювання своїхемоції, дихальні вправи — знайдіть те, що вивільняє саме вас.</p>
<p>Не соромтеся віддати всі емоції подушці, коли відчуваєте бажання плакати;дозвольте собі побути слабкими, засмученими, а якщо накипіло і кортить кричати— покричіть наодинці з собою.</p>
<p>Усі наші емоції нормальні. Питання лише в тому, чи вміємо ми помічати їх тапроживати так, щоб не нашкодити собі та іншим.</p>
<p>Комунікаційна кампанія «<a href="https://www.facebook.com/howareu.program">Ти як?»</a>It is implemented with the support of the USAID Project "Building a Sustainable Public Health System", which is performed by the Pact. Promotion in the production of spreading information and educational materials provided international organization in migration(IOM Ukraine), Megapolis Holding, BGV Charity Fund.</p>

<p>On the broadcasting of the "Uniform News" the military expert, Colonel Petro Chernyk, analyzed the situation at the front.</p>
<ul>
<li>The enemy does not give up philosophy about entering the administrative border and Donetsk regions. He fails. We are a ultra -strategic grinder routine, - Petro Chernyk is convinced.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, according to a military scientist, it is now necessary to destroy the resources of Russian invaders as much as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe that the enemy is aware that he will have to leave the South Placar. I think they would not strengthen such scarce materials of the Perekopsky isthmus, because they build a very serious line of defense there. If the war had the strength, means and understanding that the southern bridgehead remains a hell, he would not take such actions, - the expert summarized.</li>

<p>“Everyone in its place began to protect those values that are recorded in the Constitution of Ukraine, everyone is doing it for victory now!I say with confidence that it will come. Not only us but our partners believe in it, ”the Defense Minister said.</p>
<p>The Minister, appealing to NATO Summit in Vilnius, noted that he would be giving in our victory, and partners continue to support - in the appearance of shears and security decisions that Ukraine is in great need.</p>
<p>"The word" impossible "has acquired a different meaning. For me, the words of partners are "impossible today", means that it is - possible tomorrow!Just look at what path has been together in these 506 days of war. They started with Stinger, and now "Nasams", "Leopard", "Himars", "Patriot" and more, there is not enough only aunts, " - said Alexei Reznikov.</p>
<p>He stressed that everything is real, because this Alliance summit showed de facto that our country is already in NATO, and de jure-a political decision that would be accepted later. In addition, the "aircraft coalition" is formed and our partnership will prepare the preparation of Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters.</p>
<p>“We just have to do what the whole world was impossible. Something about "Kiev for 3 days", and "Ukraine in 3 weeks"? So, stand and defend, reflect and defend our own - it is absolutely possible, we have proven it. Because we are Ukrainian!” - said the head of the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>Alexei Reznikov personally thanked each of the present for the contribution of victory.</p>
<p>“I thank you for what you did, do and still make it!Everyone is proud, believes, thanks you. And, as foreigners themselves say that our armed Ukraine-truly inspire. I convey this warm emotion, wishes and support from Vilnius, ”the minister summarized.</p>

<p>"We have received a lot from this summit. Of course, we would like, as always, more, but even what we received is a great victory for us, our general, our president," the Secretary said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rnbo">NSSC</a>.</p>
<p>He stressed that being in a state of war, to become a member of the Alliance Major. Therefore, Ukrainians should gain patience and make their "homework" so that all the sectors that are related to NATO's criteria, without exception, be fulfilled.</p>
<p>According to Danilov, in relation to the military component, the transition of NATO's Estitudes, the work is moving at high speed. "But there are still certainty, which must be in accordance with the final drip according to our Constitution that our country is a NATO member," - said.</p>
<p>In this context, the NSDC Secretary stressed that NATO is very careful about many spheres of life of the Alliance. NATO - this is just a military union, and a community of which can be democraticrain, with the corresponding justice and many other criteria that Ukrainian "need to work, transform to meet all the highstanders in NATO countries," Danilov stressed.</p>
<p>"... I am sure that the next summit that will happen next year will be as victorious as possible. We will make every effort, but joint work of all of our society. It is not a task of only some separate minister Work that is not possible to seek because there is nothing impossible in the world, "the NSDC secretary emphasized.</p>

According to Danilov, a separate agreement will be drawn up with each country, now they are being worked out. "These will be transactions that will supplement each other. In this way, we are as soon as possible by the Stanmomens of this Community. So this is another additional thing that will push us in the way to NATO," Danilov said, paying attention to the claims " Seven "can join any country.Commenting on the abolition of a member of Ukraine's plan for Ukraine, he noted that the time "we became adults and many things we should go through the MAP, have already passed", and NATO is understood, so we approved one -year planning for Kiev.</p>
<p>"We are able to do it because it is for us to be a member of the Alliance, it means to have a 100 % one hundred percent of the aggression of the Russian Federation. If we do not build members of the Alliance, sooner or later imperial ambitions, regardless of who there, in Russia, will rule, They can return, and the Russians so they can return to the hot phase of relationships with any neighbor, especially the carp, " - said Danilov.</p>
<p>According to him, the last hope of Putin was buried in Vilnius from the restoration of the Russian Empire, which cannot exist without Ukraine.</p>
<p>"Now we have a historical chance to finally build our free, democratic, independent country and not have the influence of Muscovy on our territory, nankey citizens, our history and many other processes that have constantly developed us to develop," Danilov said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he emphasized the importance of owning Ukrainian citizens in English. "It should have all our children from kindergarten to be members of a free world community. English is a language of business, politics, language that has understood for the whole world. We have in our time when brusal Russification, even our mother tongue They were given to study. Therefore, for the first place, a strategic task that we can understand us that we can explain to people that we live in the world and who we are. So the modern world is built that any information is available on the Internet, first of all And there, English is a dominant of any information resources, " - said the Secretary.</p>

<p>Про те, що до цього хакерського угруповання належать колишні «офіцери» із СБУв АР Крим, які у 2014 році зрадили Батьківщину і почали прислужувати фсбросії, на урядовому порталі <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/uriadova-komanda-reahuvannia-na-kompiuterni-nadzvychaini-podii-ukrainy-zasterihaie-shchodo-novykh-kiberatak-derzhorhaniv">нагадала</a>State Service for Special Communication of the Tasks of Information of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The main task of the grouping is cyber -spy on security and defense forces. At least one case of destructive activity on the information infrastructure is also known.</p>
<p>According to Cert-UA, the number of simultaneously infected computers that mainly function within the framework of information and communication systems of state bodies can reach several thousand.</p>
<p><strong> As attack </strong></p>
<p>As a vector of primary compromise hackers mostly use electronics and messages in messengers(Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal), which are sent through pre -compromised accounts. The most common way is to send the victim of an archive containing HTM or HTA file, the opening of an united infection chain.</p>
<p>To distribute malicious programs, there is a possibility of damage to removable information, legitimate files(In particular, labels), а також модифікаціїшаблонів Microsoft Office Word, що забезпечує інфікування всіх створюваних наЕОМ документів через додавання відповідного макросу.</p>

<p>Tom Balorta seals his material with details: weapons and a military screen of a drink, a symbolic plot of the painting, where the owl holds in the claws a beaten carcass, and, of course, the personal pistol of Ukrainian scout # 1 - he carries it with a person at every interview with foreign media.</p>
<p>“It is no longer possible. All subsequent wars in any country in the world will look the same. We can say that in this we set the trend, "" Cyril Budanov said, which during the war became one zelemen of the information war against the Muscovites.</p>
<p>As an example of the effect of such activity, the Reuters journalist leads to Moscow's hysterical reaction to the promise of Kiril Budanov to destroy Russian military warriors anywhere in the world until the full victory of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“In 2014, we lost the information war. In 2022, we start differently, and now the Russians lose the information battle, ”-said GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Discussing the Russo-Ukrainian War and the role of reconnaissance data, Kirill Budanov recalled a pre-published warning from GUR MUUUKRAINA about the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“We have our sources: let's say so, in the closest [to Putin] offices. For the most part, we know what is happening, ”Kirill Budanov explained.</p>
<p>According to him, a recent attempt to rebellion Prigozhin shakes the Kremlin's regime, gave him difficulties and instability.</p>
<p>In the conversation, the journalist affected the subject of mysterious deaths involved in the maintenance of Ukraine against Ukraine, which is why in the public sphere began to draw parallels between Ukrainian and Israeli special services.</p>
<p>“If you ask Mossad as a well -known organization that eliminates the enemy state, then we did it and will do it. We do not need to do anything because it already exists, ”said the boss of Ukraine's military intelligence, traditionally not confirming, but not refuting the involvement of GUR MO to reach out of high -profile special operations in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Finally, the intelligence officer evaluated the attempt of the Russians to strike a rocket stroke of the agency.</p>

Two aircraft of the Air Force of Ukraine with a leading group of the 240th Battalion Battalion from the Dnipropetrovsk aerodrome rise into the sky. In a few hours, they are invited to one of Bosnia's airfields. More than 40 Ukrainian servicemen who arrived at the Balkans where the war is burning, immediately opened at the epicenter of hostilities: the city and the airfield are fired not by lichenpers, but also artillery. Thus began the peacekeeping mission of the young Ukrainian state, which just appeared on the political map of the world. Since then, more than 40,000 Ukrainian soldiers have visited the hot spots of our planet, participating in 30 international operations. 55 peacekeepers were killed.</p>
<p>*!The Council of Ukraine adopted Resolution No. 1165 “On establishing the day of Ukrainian peacekeepers” ._</p>
<p>Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Angola, Macedonia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Croatia, Kuwait, Sierra-Leone, Transnistria, Iraq, Lebanon, Ethiopia are not a complete list of countries where the Ukrainian flag is. Different tasks were assigned to the Ukrainian contingents who went for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from their native land.</p>
<p>Iraqi was one of the most large -scale peacekeeping operations in which Ukraine participated. About thousands of servicemen became its participants. The losses are striking: 18 killed and more than 40 wounded. Instead, during their mission, the boys contributed to the construction of 14 schools, repair of 7 dyspades, 4 roads and 3 power lines. Four objects of water supply have also been restored, medical assistance to our army doctors received 50,000 locals.</p>

<p>In Angola, for example, our warriors participated in the restoration of infrastructure, laying ways of connecting through the jungle, bridging bridges and crossings.</p>
<p>-Even if you do not take into account any military threat, there was an incredible,-said the major of the reserve Sergey Vakhtonchuk. - First of all, because of the complex conditions to which we were completely unadapted. It happened that some people lost consciousness, not withstanding the African heat.</p>
<p>But in Liberia, for almost 14 years, Ukrainian helicopters were accompanied by painful columns, carried out transport and passenger transportation, conducted air patrols of borders, medical evacuation and search and rescue operations, and also delivered to the farthest and virtually inaccessible townships. In total, during the entire UN mission in this country as part of the 56th helicopter, the location of which was Halychyna at that time, the task was performed over five thousand Ukrainian aviators, having spent 60 thousand hours in the sky of this distant country and transported almost 250 thousand passengers and passengers and passengers and passengers More than 6.5 thousand tons of various cargoes. Our helicopters came to our native land only in 2018 - in the third year of Russian aggression. During 14 years, 23 rotations of the Ukrainian contingent took place in Liberia. But any extraordinary situations were avoided. The helicopters, returning from this country, did not crack on the difficulties and problems associated with the re -interpretation, but focused on the other - in the acquisition of invaluable experience in the difficult conditions.</p>
<p>In the Congo and Afghanistan, which literally swept by mines, Ukrainian saperizes tens of thousands of explosive objects, daily risking lives.</p>
