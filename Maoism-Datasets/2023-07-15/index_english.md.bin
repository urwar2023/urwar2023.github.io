![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-14T-11-42-00-03-00/630_360_1674752556-437.jpg)The decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of "Russia against Ukraine", which is exposed to July 18, will be presented in writing.

This was reported in a comment to the Ukrinform correspondent in the Hague in the ECtHR Authorized Affairs Margarita Sokorenko.

“In accordance with the ECtHR Prescribe, the decision should be published on July 18, 2023 on the site, which houses all its decisions. Therefore, it will be written, not as in previous interstate cases - with a public pronouncement. In principle, it is logical, given the history of Russia's claim to the ECtHR, and the refusal of the Russian Federation to cooperate with the court since March 2022, ”she said.

Sokorenko also expressed the expectation that the result in this case is comforting.

“For me, this lawsuit is about the alternative version of Russia's aggression against our state. In short, they declared a number of human rights violations, first of all, the Russian -speaking population, talking about discrimination of andutis. I can only evaluate Ukraine's chances in this case, and, as for me, the result will please, ”the ECtHR Commissioner for Affairs said.

“Almost every month we see new decisions in individual matters of Russian citizens, in which the ECtHR states quite stringent violations. By the way, this week, an important decision in the case of Nemtsov Anti -President was made at the request in February 2015. The ECtHR pointed to a number of shortcomings and problems in the investigation of Nemtsov's murder, "Sokorenko said.

In addition, she noted, the ECtHR has intensified in interstate cases “Ukraine's opposite of(As for Crimea)”And“ Ukraine and the Netherlands v. The descended procedural steps will take place in the fall of this year, noted.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-14T48-00-00-04-00/12-8.jpg)Every day we hear about the need to "stay". But do we understand this ZAZKLIK? After all, restraining the feelings, on the contrary we exhale our body.

War is daily challenges for our psyche and emotional stability. We live the sounds of sirens, constant erection from the front, grueling expectations and vibrations of plants - despair, despair, anger, fatigue, hope. What to do with all these people? Often they are so untimely and seem unnecessary. There are three steps:

- notice emotions in the moment("Oh, I'm angry");

- To accept them("Everything ok, it's okay, I know how to handle it");

- live them constructively(“Jogging will help to spill anger”).

Що означає «прожити конструктивно»? Не завдати шкоди собі чи людям навколо.Тобто спрямувати енергію злості, розпачу, агресії чи болю в якусь дію, якавивільняє цю енергію екологічно: танці, спорт, терапія криком, малювання своїхемоції, дихальні вправи — знайдіть те, що вивільняє саме вас.

Не соромтеся віддати всі емоції подушці, коли відчуваєте бажання плакати;дозвольте собі побути слабкими, засмученими, а якщо накипіло і кортить кричати— покричіть наодинці з собою.

Усі наші емоції нормальні. Питання лише в тому, чи вміємо ми помічати їх тапроживати так, щоб не нашкодити собі та іншим.

Комунікаційна кампанія «[Ти як?»](https://www.facebook.com/howareu.program)It is implemented with the support of the USAID Project "Building a Sustainable Public Health System", which is performed by the Pact. Promotion in the production of spreading information and educational materials provided international organization in migration(IOM Ukraine), Megapolis Holding, BGV Charity Fund.

The project "How are you?" It is one of the key "puzzles" of the All -Ukrainian program of economic health, which is introduced in Ukraine at the initiative of the first lady [Elena Zelenskaya](https://www.facebook.com/olenazelenska.official).

- The enemy does not give up philosophy about entering the administrative border and Donetsk regions. He fails. We are a ultra -strategic grinder routine, - Petro Chernyk is convinced.

At the same time, according to a military scientist, it is now necessary to destroy the resources of Russian invaders as much as possible.

- I believe that the enemy is aware that he will have to leave the South Placar. I think they would not strengthen such scarce materials of the Perekopsky isthmus, because they build a very serious line of defense there. If the war had the strength, means and understanding that the southern bridgehead remains a hell, he would not take such actions, - the expert summarized.

At the same time, in case of refusal to sign contracts, the commanders resort to the commodity of subordinates and direct threats of keeping them on the forefront without rotation.

As encouraging the mobilized who have agreed, the release of duties for 1-2 days is used(so -called. weekend)which is a rather efficient factor in the conditions of refusal of leave commanders, in particular, in family circumstances.

The main task of the grouping is cyber -spy on security and defense forces. At least one case of destructive activity on the information infrastructure is also known.

According to Cert-UA, the number of simultaneously infected computers that mainly function within the framework of information and communication systems of state bodies can reach several thousand.

** As attack **

As a vector of primary compromise hackers mostly use electronics and messages in messengers(Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal), which are sent through pre -compromised accounts. The most common way is to send the victim of an archive containing HTM or HTA file, the opening of an united infection chain.

To distribute malicious programs, there is a possibility of damage to removable information, legitimate files(In particular, labels), а також модифікаціїшаблонів Microsoft Office Word, що забезпечує інфікування всіх створюваних наЕОМ документів через додавання відповідного макросу.

Після початкового ураження зловмисники можуть викрадати файли з розширеннями.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .odt, .txt, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf, .ps1, .rar,.zip, .7z, .mdb протягом 30-50 хвилин — здебільшого із застосуванням шкідливихпрограм GAMMASTEEL.

Tom Balorta seals his material with details: weapons and a military screen of a drink, a symbolic plot of the painting, where the owl holds in the claws a beaten carcass, and, of course, the personal pistol of Ukrainian scout # 1 - he carries it with a person at every interview with foreign media.

“It is no longer possible. All subsequent wars in any country in the world will look the same. We can say that in this we set the trend, "" Cyril Budanov said, which during the war became one zelemen of the information war against the Muscovites.

As an example of the effect of such activity, the Reuters journalist leads to Moscow's hysterical reaction to the promise of Kiril Budanov to destroy Russian military warriors anywhere in the world until the full victory of Ukraine.

“In 2014, we lost the information war. In 2022, we start differently, and now the Russians lose the information battle, ”-said GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Discussing the Russo-Ukrainian War and the role of reconnaissance data, Kirill Budanov recalled a pre-published warning from GUR MUUUKRAINA about the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation.

“We have our sources: let's say so, in the closest [to Putin] offices. For the most part, we know what is happening, ”Kirill Budanov explained.

According to him, a recent attempt to rebellion Prigozhin shakes the Kremlin's regime, gave him difficulties and instability.

In the conversation, the journalist affected the subject of mysterious deaths involved in the maintenance of Ukraine against Ukraine, which is why in the public sphere began to draw parallels between Ukrainian and Israeli special services.

“If you ask Mossad as a well -known organization that eliminates the enemy state, then we did it and will do it. We do not need to do anything because it already exists, ”said the boss of Ukraine's military intelligence, traditionally not confirming, but not refuting the involvement of GUR MO to reach out of high -profile special operations in the Russian Federation.

Finally, the intelligence officer evaluated the attempt of the Russians to strike a rocket stroke of the agency.

Two aircraft of the Air Force of Ukraine with a leading group of the 240th Battalion Battalion from the Dnipropetrovsk aerodrome rise into the sky. In a few hours, they are invited to one of Bosnia's airfields. More than 40 Ukrainian servicemen who arrived at the Balkans where the war is burning, immediately opened at the epicenter of hostilities: the city and the airfield are fired not by lichenpers, but also artillery. Thus began the peacekeeping mission of the young Ukrainian state, which just appeared on the political map of the world. Since then, more than 40,000 Ukrainian soldiers have visited the hot spots of our planet, participating in 30 international operations. 55 peacekeepers were killed.

*!The Council of Ukraine adopted Resolution No. 1165 “On establishing the day of Ukrainian peacekeepers” ._

Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Angola, Macedonia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Croatia, Kuwait, Sierra-Leone, Transnistria, Iraq, Lebanon, Ethiopia are not a complete list of countries where the Ukrainian flag is. Different tasks were assigned to the Ukrainian contingents who went for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from their native land.

Iraqi was one of the most large -scale peacekeeping operations in which Ukraine participated. About thousands of servicemen became its participants. The losses are striking: 18 killed and more than 40 wounded. Instead, during their mission, the boys contributed to the construction of 14 schools, repair of 7 dyspades, 4 roads and 3 power lines. Four objects of water supply have also been restored, medical assistance to our army doctors received 50,000 locals.

In Angola, for example, our warriors participated in the restoration of infrastructure, laying ways of connecting through the jungle, bridging bridges and crossings.

-Even if you do not take into account any military threat, there was an incredible,-said the major of the reserve Sergey Vakhtonchuk. - First of all, because of the complex conditions to which we were completely unadapted. It happened that some people lost consciousness, not withstanding the African heat.

But in Liberia, for almost 14 years, Ukrainian helicopters were accompanied by painful columns, carried out transport and passenger transportation, conducted air patrols of borders, medical evacuation and search and rescue operations, and also delivered to the farthest and virtually inaccessible townships. In total, during the entire UN mission in this country as part of the 56th helicopter, the location of which was Halychyna at that time, the task was performed over five thousand Ukrainian aviators, having spent 60 thousand hours in the sky of this distant country and transported almost 250 thousand passengers and passengers and passengers and passengers More than 6.5 thousand tons of various cargoes. Our helicopters came to our native land only in 2018 - in the third year of Russian aggression. During 14 years, 23 rotations of the Ukrainian contingent took place in Liberia. But any extraordinary situations were avoided. The helicopters, returning from this country, did not crack on the difficulties and problems associated with the re -interpretation, but focused on the other - in the acquisition of invaluable experience in the difficult conditions.

In the Congo and Afghanistan, which literally swept by mines, Ukrainian saperizes tens of thousands of explosive objects, daily risking lives.
