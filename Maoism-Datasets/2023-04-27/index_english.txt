The collection of information about prisoners was harvested. All photos and videos that are published by analysts are used. They are verified. The enemy deliberately manipulates that people who return from captivity transmitted the data.
About it reports Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.
The staff representative stressed that only some of our captives were confirmed by the Russian side, but Ukraine is working to return everyone: both those who are considered missing and those whom the Russian Federation did not confirm, but the consciousness of captivity. And it often succeeds.
The relatives are worried about whether their defenders and defenders are submitting to exchange. Alerosia of hundreds of the submitted can only agree to exchange a few. The final decision to whom will be changed is made by the party that holds the prisoners. Ukrainian sales funds to return everyone - regardless of the unit or place of detention.
“The enemy spreads a lot of false data on social networks to then say that Ukraine does nothing to return its people. But if it was true, exchanges would happen after the fighting was completed, as during the previous wars. And we have already managed to return more than two thousand prisoners, ”the headquarters representative said.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said During a speech at the final panel conference on the restoration of Ukraine in Rome:
“Ms. Prime Minister Italy!
Mr. Prime Minister of Ukraine!
Ms. Vice President of the Confederation of the Italian Industry!
Ladies and Gentlemen!Dear present!The road Italie!
Thank you for this conference and sincere interest in Ukraine. I know that the menesluks are representatives and representatives of hundreds of Italian and Ukrainian companies, and I would like to turn to you not just as those who embody the business. And as to dads and moms, to sons and daughters, as to the representatives of your communities, your cities, your country ...
There are completely different people, different families, different generations, but we are in fact one aspirations with you. We all want freedom and normal development for our children, we want safety and well -being for our parents. The desires and lightness of life for their communities and cities. And it unites us.
And this is what I suggest talking about.
About how we can give you more safety to our families together. Most weave our countries. More freedom to Ukrainian and Italian children. More guarantees of normal life for our communities and our cities.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
It is already clear when and what this war should end, which Russia has solved anti -nouns. Against all of us. Against Ukraine and all our common European home, who gave a chance for a peaceful life and prosperity to all European peoples. I have a doubt that we are able to win. Because we not only believe in our own strength, but we stand and protect our common values in unity. In unity!Whoever keeps unity and does not lose strength, he wins.
I want to thank all of Italy now, all your people and communities, your leadership and personally Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this unity. The unity of Europeans who know that beyond our freedom, that is, where all of us in Europe wants to reject Russia, there can be no normal and dangerous life.
We have to do - and we will do!- All that this Russian war ended in Russian. And so, this year we have to do everything to the maximum to prepare the largest economic project of our time in Europe - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine.In this war, the world saw that it was necessary for the real protection of every nation. It has been awarded how to change energy and infrastructure, production of and logistics, cyber systems and educational space, the defense industry of the army.
Therefore, there is a demand for new security standards in the world to make every country beyond any manifestations of aggression, terror or element. And we will create such security standards in Ukraine.
I will give you five examples that will show you the practical meaning of what I say.
The first is energy.
Russia has launched a real energyaging against Europe. She provoked the price crisis of impoverishment of millions of families because of the growth of accounts. She tried to produce physical supply of fuel to Europe. She beat rockets and Iranian Drones on our energy so that Ukrainians remain without electricity and heat. Europe stood. We answered this call with dignity. And we must do everything to make the enemy not the theoretical opportunity to break the nurser gun.
The "green" transformation of energy and a kind of decentralization of production is a response. The more manufacturers - "green" energy producers, is a more toxic system. The more sources of supply, the more reliably the city, every community and every family is provided.
Plus Italy is one of the leaders in creating "smart" networks(smart grids).Тому я запрошую ваші компанії разом розвивати українські мережі. І, будьласка, не забувайте, що в найближчій перспективі українські мережі будутьмережами Євросоюзу.
Друге — власне будівництво.
Українці ніколи не здадуть своєї країни ворогу й ніколи не полишать своєїземлі. Хоч сотні наших сіл і десятки міст спалені ударами російської артилеріїта авіації, українці здатні повернути їх до життя. Не у звичці нашого народу —залишати на своїй землі рани, що не загоїлися.
Ми маємо колосальну потребу у відбудові тисяч будинків, сотень шкіл, лікарень,транспортної, виробничої інфраструктури. Причому на новій безпековій основі,яка має стати типовою для інших країн, для міст у тих країнах, де люди вхороші часи можуть і не задумуватися про безпеку. Але розуміють, що гарантіїпотрібні.
Щоб кожен батько був спокійним за свою дитину у школі — бо там є сховище,безпечне місце, яке гарантує захист. Щоб кожна мати знала: у її громаді, у їїмісті безпекова інфраструктура влаштована так, що будь-який терорист — чидержава, як Росія, чи якась терористична організація — точно програє наявнійсистемі безпеки.
The third example is technologies.
Full -scale Russian aggression did not break Ukrainian finances, banking system, digital services that our people are used to.
We have preserved the connection in the country and all that is not to imagine modern life. Babil, we have attracted our Aviters to the cyber defense of the state and the economy. Miporoborons were constructed by the country. We continue to develop an action state service that provides access to public services through a smartphone or portal.
In addition, partners in Europe are already taking our "action" for their digital development.
Our defense industry is gaining momentum even now when the war is brushing. We are interested in the localization in Ukraine of the production of such military equipment we receive from partners. We build new produce of our own weapons and ammunition. We create new protection tools such as floxes as a wide range of drones for our front.
I am sure that your companies have something to add to these stories of Ukrainian success.
The fourth is global markets.
The world has already understood the potential of our country's agrarian sector. Ukrainian is to guarantee global food stability. Supply from Ukraine is food on the tables of millions of families in different countries, including Africa, Asia. Pulge to Ethiopia, from Lebanon to Yemen. Without our supply to some countries, the chaos would be accumulated. And that means - there would be new waves of migration, including Uevrop.
In addition, there is no such considerable potential for green metallurgy in Ukraine in Europe. From iron ore to lithium and other maximum -needed resources - all this is Ukraine. From natural gas to the way ... We can give - and give!- All this global markets. We can largely replace the company with Russia - those who have chosen work for war, not a mentally development.
But the number one task is processing. So, these are new enterprises. So, it is new logistics and modernization of transport. So, these are new investments. Aotge, these are profits. And I am sure that your companies too.
And the fifth example - and this is far from the last of cooperation - pharmaceutical and rehabilitation.
There is a purely economic fact: Ukraine is a huge market and net import pharmaceutical goods. One thing already means that the localization of the production of in Ukraine gives an obvious benefit.To finish the war is, in particular, to quench the pain that was survived in the war, brought from the war, associated with the war. Obviously, we will work over this in Ukraine - and together with the best representatives of the world.
Ukraine sees what is the key security demand. Ukraine has a unique experience in the protection of the state and people in the face of aggression and all possible manifestations of the terror. There is no such evil that Russia would not try to do against Ukrainians, which we would not have to defend.
Our experience of protection is successful and scales on the lives of other peoples, other countries.
It is logical that our experience will become part of the new security foundation of the world. Asks you, Italy, to build a new security with us!I invite you, your investments, your experience is now coming to Ukraine.
Please in contact with our delegation at the conference with the Panpremier of Ukraine. Ukraine is ready for cooperation!
Glory to all who bring our victory closer!
Grazie Italia!
Glory to Ukraine!".

 The Security Service exposed two more supporters of Rashism who went on voluntary work with the enemy after the temporary seizure of South of Ukraine.
About it reports Security Service of Ukraine.
Among the detainees is the former head of one of the "departments" created by the aggressor "Basin water management of Kherson region".
In this "position" she participated in the establishment of water supply for the need for the need for the need for the Russian Federation, which were stationed on the temporarily captured territory of the region.
To do this, she formed the staff of the department and called on the locals to join the ranks of the pseudo -institution.
Before dismissing the regional center, the collaborator fled to Kiev, where she planned to "get lost" among the residents of the capital and thus avoid justice.
However, the SBU staff installed its location and detained.
Another head of the aggressor was a resident of Kherson, who during the period of the city was settled with the invaders of the "Regional Pension Fund".
There, the malefactor was involved in the instructions of Moscow to introduce a "ruble zone" in the region.
It is established that the person involved forced the elderly to receive pensions of Urosian currency.
After the liberation of the city, the malefactor escaped to Odessa, where her delayed contractors of the SBU.
During the searches at the place of temporary residence, the cash of the Urosian rubles was found, which the invaders charged her as a "salary".
Currently, both involved persons have been informed of suspicion under Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine(Collaboration).
Одній з них суд уже обрав запобіжний захід — тримання під вартою.
Розслідування проводили співробітники СБУ у Херсонській та Одеській областяхза процесуального керівництва органів прокуратури.

I wish health, dear Ukrainians! 
Today, there is an important political result in Strasbourg - at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. A resolution was adopted, which is recognized that Russia's deportation contains signs of genocide. And this is the first recognition of such a fact at the level of such a high international organization that unites the states of our continent.
To put it practically, this decision will significantly help our global work for the involvement of Russia and its officials, including the leader of the terrorist state, accountable for genocide, genocide policy of anti-Ukraine.
The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the well -designed elements of Russia to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. It is a conscious crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. Sametak should qualify both politically and legally.
Today, the first lady of Ukraine addressed the PACE - for children, families ... Overpartlemen and our diplomats worked well. And at all levels - formal and informal, with leaders of states, at the parliamentary, government, law enforcement levels, in the legal community and in international immigrant organizations - we will continue to work to return all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia. We have been cleared of nearly 20,000 children who have been taken out and scattered across different regions. But it is obvious that it is only part of the much larger criminal offices. Such children can be much larger.
Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to destroy peoples. It is the Natroian example - the responsibility of this state and its officials, guilty of genocide - we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that impunity will never be again. And the sentences for genocide will be. Similarly, for all other crimes of Russia against Ukraine and our people.
In Nikolaev, the parsing of rubble on the site of the rocket stroke, which was tonight, has already ended. More than 20 wounded, one person was killed ... My condolences and loved ones.In the evening, another rocket strike was inflicted in Konstantinovka of Donetsk region. The school, hospital, and dwellings were also injured. Unfortunately, there are affected people.
Unfortunately, the legal machine of the world is gaining momentum. But it is gaining. Unfortunately, the political pressure of the world on the terrorist state, the sanction pressure has not yet reached full. But he reaches…
But our warriors from the first day of this battle to protect people and humanity will work absolutely everything!And even more than possible.
Avdiivka-the 35th separate brigade of the Marines. Marinka is our glorious "seventystyatyak" ... Donetsk direction in general-55th separate artillery "… Thank you, the soldiers, the warriors, for the constant performance!
Zaporizhzhya direction-today, as always, there is something to thank the soldiers of our 44th separate artillery brigade. Well done!
Today, he gave his gratitude to the soldiers and commander of the 95th Separate Brigade of DShV, who are very powerfully fighting near Kreminna in Luhansk region.
And separately I want to thank absolutely to anyone who defends Bakhmut and destroys the tamborog as large -scale as the occupier deserved it.
Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations! 
Thank everyone in the world who helps us!

 The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the fully thoughtful elements of the efforts to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. The centered crime of genocide committed by Russian officials.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in , reports Ukrinform.
Viso: 
I wish health, dear Ukrainians! 
Today, there is an important political result in Strasbourg - at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. A resolution was adopted, which is recognized that Russia's deportation contains signs of genocide. And this is the first recognition of such a fact at the level of such a high international organization that unites the states of our continent.
To put it practically, this decision will significantly help our global work for the involvement of Russia and its officials, including the leader of the terrorist state, accountable for genocide, genocide policy of anti-Ukraine.
The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the well -designed elements of Russia to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. It is a conscious crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. Sametak should qualify both politically and legally.
Today, the first lady of Ukraine addressed the PACE - for children, families ... Overpartlemen and our diplomats worked well. And at all levels - formal and informal, with leaders of states, at the parliamentary, government, law enforcement levels, in the legal community and in international immigrant organizations - we will continue to work to return all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia. We have been cleared of nearly 20,000 children who have been taken out and scattered across different regions. But it is obvious that it is only part of the much larger criminal offices. Such children can be much larger.
Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to destroy peoples. It is the Natroian example - the responsibility of this state and its officials, guilty of genocide - we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that impunity will never be again. And the sentences for genocide will be. Similarly, for all other crimes of Russia against Ukraine and our people.
In Nikolaev, the parsing of rubble on the site of the rocket stroke, which was tonight, has already ended. More than 20 wounded, one person was killed ... My condolences and loved ones.In the evening, another rocket strike was inflicted in Konstantinovka of Donetsk region. The school, hospital, and dwellings were also injured. Unfortunately, there are affected people.
Unfortunately, the legal machine of the world is gaining momentum. But it is gaining. Unfortunately, the political pressure of the world on the terrorist state, the sanction pressure has not yet reached full. But he reaches…
But our warriors from the first day of this battle to protect people and humanity will work absolutely everything!And even more than possible.
Avdiivka-the 35th separate brigade of the Marines. Marinka is our glorious "seventystyatyak" ... Donetsk direction in general-55th separate artillery "… Thank you, the soldiers, the warriors, for the constant performance!
Zaporizhzhya direction-today, as always, there is something to thank the soldiers of our 44th separate artillery brigade. Well done!
Today, he gave his gratitude to the soldiers and commander of the 95th Separate Brigade of DShV, who are very powerfully fighting near Kreminna in Luhansk region.
And separately I want to thank absolutely to anyone who defends Bakhmut and destroys the tamborog as large -scale as the occupier deserved it.
Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations! 
Thank everyone in the world who helps us! 
Eternal memory to all whose lives took away Russian terror! 
Glory to Ukraine!

The State Duma deputy Gurulev stated that in Russia, it is time to introduce the concept of "enemular".
In his opinion, such measures will contribute to the discipline of society.
It is noted that in fact the intimidation of the Russians is the only active method of mobilization in the Russian Federation, so more and more Russian media are broadcasting similarly. In this way, the Russian authorities analyze the reaction of their population with sophisticated radical statements from Kremlin politicians and propagandists, which allows to increase dictatorship.

Third, As a rule, the personnel of the Main Directorate of the Intelligence of Defense of Ukraine during the performance of combat missions are ensured by the same principle as all military personnel of the Armed Forces-thanks to the Ministry of Defense, contracts for food organization services.

Under the stability of these children, deep and long -term scars of injuries are hidden, ”the OSCE official's official representative in the OSCE.
The Russian war has led to the movement of about 3.5 million Ukrainian children. Families were broken because their parents faced a difficult decision to send their children to a safe place as they remain in the area. Other children were taken away.
“Separation with parents is a form of injury that gives these children a greater risk of psychological problems. Children who have undergone a long separation with their parents often experience strong fear, panic, grief, depression, helplessness and hopelessness - feelings that should not be expected from the child. The organization of Save The Children reported that on average, children had spent more than 900 hours. 900 hours that children had to spend on training, a group of communication. When children come out of these bins, many are faced with the destruction of their schools, kindergartens and playgrounds. And the objects that stand, parents perceive not as safe places, but as a potential threat of Russian rocket firing, ”Nile Bush says.
According to him, despite convictions from the international community, the Kremlin shows any repentance and compassion for the suffering they caused.
“Ukrainian children deserve the future without fragments, bins and armed blocks. The United Kingdom will do everything possible to support Ukrainian protection of her homeland and protect the future of its younger generation, ”Nile Bush researched.

 According to confirmed data in the Russian captivity, there are currently 19 390 Ukrainian children, forcibly exported by the occupiers to the territory of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by Elena Zelenska during a speech on the PACE debates for considering the results of forced by Russia of Ukrainian children, informs Office of the President of Ukraine.
The first lady of Ukraine Elena Zelenska participated in the debates, which took place by a shock procedure at the plenary session of the second part of the Session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. During the meeting, a report was adopted a draft resolution on the topic: "The situation with Ukrainian civilians, in particular with children, forcibly displaced or relocated to the Russian Federation, Ukrainian territories under the actual control of the Russian Federation."
The draft resolution was prepared within the framework of the PACE Committee on Migration, refugees of displaced persons. Speaker - Paulo Sand(Portugal, Soc).
Дружина Президента подякувала учасникам пленарного засідання ПАРЄ за увагу дотеми примусової депортації українських дітей.
«Ця тема дуже болить Україні. Дякую за те, що долучилися до боротьби за нашихдітей та їхнє дитинство. У нас кажуть: „Чужих дітей не буває“. Ви доводите цетим, що зараз тут», — зазначила дружина Президента
Олена Зеленська розповіла історії дітей, викрадених російськими окупантами.12-річний Сашко був із мамою Сніжаною в Маріуполі, коли місто оточилиросійські військові. Разом вони пережили страшні обстріли, відсутність води,тепла, голод, поранення Сашка. Поки їх не розділили росіяни. Їм не дали навітьпопрощатися. Хлопцю сказали, що мама відмовилася від нього. Сашка вдалосяврятувати, але мама все ще в полоні у російських окупантів.
12-річна Кіра також була з татом у Маріуполі, коли росіяни почали нищитимісто. Тато, колишній капітан збірної України з водного поло ЄвгенОбедінський, загинув під час бомбардування. Дівчинку окупанти вивезли вДонецьк. Величезними зусиллями держави, громадських діячів, десятківнебайдужих Кіру повернули до бабусі й дідуся.
“These stories show all this terrible technology, as it is occupied by Ukrainian children. Most often - having killed their parents or forced to divorce with families. And they export entire children's homes and boarding schools, ”the first lady said.
She stressed that these are stories that have a good end when children managed to turn. There are 361 of them.
"But there is a figure that is even more striking - 19 390. It is the number of children who are still captive. And these are only those data that are confirmed. But this number is final, because what happens to the children in the occupied territories is unknown. For each figure - a broken life not only of the child, but of her family, all who have no rest for months, ”Olena Zelenska said.
“It is a violence that lasts right now. Because right now a child is Taksama, like Sasha, they lie that she is not needed, that she has been abandoned. Some kind, like Kira, crying for her parents killed in her eyes. Children, as Matmatvia and his sisters, are prepared for forced adoption. Just now they have a relationship with loved ones, ”she added.
The president's wife emphasized that every day, every hour in captivity, the psychic of children and families costs health and life. Therefore, Ukraine requires non -coping of the world - all possible effective help is needed for their liberation.
“I ask to treat this exactly as a call to all our common values. Our idea of good and evil. This is the case when salvage is only the efforts of the world. Let's become such a world for our children. They believed in the world and his people again, after all the experienced, they all the confidence, ”said Elena Zelenskaya.

Today, there is an important political result in Strasbourg - at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. A resolution was adopted, which is recognized that Russia's deportation contains signs of genocide. And this is the first recognition of such a fact at the level of such a high international organization that unites the states of our continent.
To put it practically, this decision will significantly help our global work for the involvement of Russia and its officials, including the leader of the terrorist state, accountable for genocide, genocide policy of anti-Ukraine.
The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the well -designed elements of Russia to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. It is a conscious crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. Sametak should qualify both politically and legally.
Today, the first lady of Ukraine appealed to the PACE - for children, families ... Overparliamentarians and our diplomats worked well. And at all levels - formal and informal, with leaders of states, at parliamentary, government, law enforcement levels, in the legal community and in international immigrant organizations - we will continue to work to return all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia. We have been cleared of nearly 20,000 children who have been taken out and scattered across different regions. But it is obvious that it is only part of the much larger criminal offices. Such children can be much larger.
Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to destroy peoples. It is the Natroian example - the responsibility of this state and its officials, guilty of genocide - we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that impunity will never be again. And the sentences for genocide will be. Similarly, for all other crimes of Russia against Ukraine and our people.
In Nikolaev, the parsing of rubble on the site of the rocket stroke, which was tonight, has already ended. More than 20 wounded, one person was killed ... My condolences and loved ones.
The rockets damaged dozens of ordinary homes, two educational institutions. Calibers against school and college, against residential buildings.
In the evening, another rocket strike was inflicted in Konstantinovka of Donetsk region. The school, hospital, and dwellings were also injured. Unfortunately, there are affected people.But our warriors from the first day of this battle to protect people and humanity will work absolutely everything!And even more than possible.
Avdiivka-the 35th separate brigade of the Marines. Marinka is our glorious "seventystyevyatka" ... Donetsk direction in general-55th separate artillery "… Thank you, the warriors, for the unchanged efficiency!
The Zaporizhzhya direction-today, as always, there is something to thank the soldiers of our 44th separate artillery brigade. Well done!
Today, he gave his gratitude to the soldiers and commander of the 95th Separate Brigade of DShV, who are very powerfully fighting near Kreminna in Luhansk region.
And separately I want to thank absolutely to anyone who defends Bakhmut and destroys the tamborog as large -scale as the occupier deserved it.
Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations!
Thank you all in the world who helps us!
Eternal memory to all whose lives have taken away Russian terror!
Glory to Ukraine!
