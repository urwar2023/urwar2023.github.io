<p>Description: Агентство ООН у справах біженців у п'ятницю закликало уряди країн впустити на свою територію цивільних осіб, які тікають із Судану, і не відправляти їх назад до охопленої конфліктом країни. — Укрінформ.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-refugee-agency-calls-governments-not-return-people-sudan-2023-05-05/"></a>"We advise the governments not to return people to Sudan because of the conflict that is tamped," said the Director of the UN High Commissioner for Elizabeth Tang.</p>
<p>She noted that this applies to Sudan citizens, foreign citizens, including refugees who are accepted in Sudan, stateless persons, as well as those who do not have a passport or any other form of identification.</p>
<p>According to the UN, the conflict in Sudan has forced about 100,000 people to escape from the neighboring countries and hinders the delivery of assistance to a country where about third -pumping is already relied on humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>"It is likely that those who run need a high level of international protection," Tank summed up about civilians running away from Sudan.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, the head of the humanitarian program <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon"></a>Martin Griffiths stated that he was working with the obligation from the warring parties in Sudan to protect the humanitarian assistance to ensure its delivery to those who need it.</p>

<p>Cogler recalled that Austria is one of those 35 countries that demanded that the mobs on the removal of Russian and Belarussian athletes from the participation of Volhympiad through the War of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.</p>
<p>"With all respect for the autonomy of sports - unlike the IOC, we, the Ministry of Export, are not about Russian and Belarussian athletes, but above all about Ukrainian athletes. After all Who is in these crimes. Is it acceptable to Ukrainian athletes to meet Russian athletes? I would say: perhaps only in rare cases. Aletonno not when the other person was or is a member of the army that is not responsible for atrocities and destruction. And this applies to very much Many, ”the Austrian minister has arranged.</p>
<p>In his opinion, a neutral athlete can be considered "only one who is not a military personnel and did not support Russian aggression, verbally or in another way." In doing so, he pointed to the understanding that "there may be attempts to give particularly active athletes in individual sports." However, "in the case of teams, this is hardly possible, since the proximity to the nation is much stronger."</p>
<p>"Among the 35 countries there are many who are not to be allowed to participate in the Volhympi Games with a Russian passport. I do not have such an opinion. It is possible to distinguish. But the IOC should be more accurate than it was so far, clearly and clearly and clearly and Strictly interpreting our own recommendations. For example, we need a date from which someone can no longer be considered a Russian military. And of course, this date should be in the past, " - said Kohler.Commenting on the position of the leadership of the Austrian Olympic Committee(Aok), which is unheard of the IOC line, cogler is indicated that "some national Olympic committees are very close to the IOC, Austrian is one of them." " In the same case, we have a different approach. But Menivova to imagine that Stos eventually believes that Russian military personnel participate in the Olympic Games, "he said.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, the agency reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/shipments-ukraine-slowing-black-sea-grain-deal-deadline-nears-2023-05-05/"></a>Under this Agreement, Ukraine was able to export about 29.5 million tons of agricultural products, including 14.9 million tons of corn and 8.1 million concrete wheat, for less than a year.</p>
<p>"However, the number of vessels that come to pick up goods has reduced this week to two vessels a day from three to four vessels in the average three -year -old three weeks," the publication said.</p>

<p>"At the moment, we do not participate in this trade ... This is a risky sphere - it is difficult to predict what will happen," said Norden Director Yangrindbo.</p>
<p>"Things can change quickly ... From the moment you agree to go to the cop, and until the ship really arrives," he added.</p>
<p>As it is noted, Moscow threatened to leave the grain agreement on May 18. Until the proceedings of the agreement have been officially notified.</p>

<p>“There is now a discussion, a difficult process. And you know that Ukraine is still waiting for the vote of the relevant resolution of the UN General Assembly. Here, in fact, we are saying that you say: in order for the tribunal to make the first sentences, numerously lists, it must be formed. And the model that Ukrainianades chooses itself, it is before, or as an impetus to it involves the vote of the resellence of the UN General Assembly. Therefore, in parallel in this group and with our partners around the world, we are working on the text of this resolution, ” - said the deputy head of the OP.</p>

<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>

<p>In the morning, after returning from the Netherlands, he met with Bahrain Minister. This, by the way, is the first visit of the head of the political department of this country for all the time of our diplomatic relations - since 1992. That is another argument that the world not only believes in Ukraine, but also sees how our state strengthens.</p>
<p>We spoke to the minister with how we can bring peace to Ukraine together and restore peace and stability to international relations. I thanked the unchanging support of Ukraine and civilized rules, including support for the UN designer. We talked about the Ukrainian formula of peace, and I believe that Bahrain could join it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the summit took place on the anniversary of our state charity platformunited24. When the work of this platform began last May, we had a chief task - to unite ordinary people around the world, to unite for the advantage of Ukraine and to protect freedom. And it succeeded!</p>
<p>United24 has collected from different people, from different companies from 110 world countries. We have 15 star ambassadors. I am personally proud of the support from the part of our work for the sake of naval drones, as well as all projects that are related to the freezers for the front. These are thousands of drones that make Ukraine more powerful.</p>
<p>Much has been done within the UNITED24 medical direction, and the results of the reconstruction are also the results. Now we add educational direction - it is the restoration of schools, as well as demining. The great task that Ukraine has faced and which can be launched not for decades, but for years, if there is sufficient global support. No Russian mines in our land should remain!</p>
<p>In the evening, he met with a delegation of the United States Congress. We were extinguished about the further interaction between our states for the sake of global consciousness.Also today was a meeting with representatives of the Venetian Commission, representatives of the Blackrock Investment Fund.</p>
<p>So, in a week: the United States and Bahrain, the Netherlands and Belgium, Finland Sweden, Norway and Denmark, Iceland. Canada. New Zealand. African Union and Comoros. But the whole multinational community of donors United24. We do our best for the world to hear Ukraine, to understand Ukraine and advised Ukraine. Because by helping us, the world protects itself.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that as a result of meetings in Helsinki and Hague we have a powerful development for our soldiers with weapons - on earth, in the air and at sea. I thank the partners!This is a significant intensification. We have more progress towards NATO and the European Union. We have more progress on Russia's responsibility for aggression against our state.</p>
<p>Glory to everyone and everyone who is now in battle for Ukraine, on combat missions at combat posts!Particularly grateful for this week to all the fighters of our air forces and all units of other kinds of troops defending the sky!</p>
<p>To stand, win and punish the enemy is our common task. In unity, daily making Ukraine stronger, daily adding new opportunities to our country, we will get to victory!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all our heroes of different times, who defended and protected Ukraine!</p>

It is a well -established and complex system of medical, psychological and professional measures aimed at preventing the development of pathological processes that lead to loss of performance; Effective Iranian return of servicemen to professional activity.Recently, the government has simplified the mechanism of referral for treatment abroad of defenders of Ukraine.</p>

About the path to this special activity of Simis correspondent Army _ </strong> <strong> _inform _ </strong> <strong> </strong> _Sear of the central administration</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-05T53-00-00-04-00/1-21.jpg" />In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the decision to the pilot project from the CVS was made on May 5, 2014. His work was successfully started in the shortest possible time - a month later.</p>
<p>In the context of the Russian Federation, a hybrid warfare against Ukraine, civil-military cooperation has become an adequate response to novocardum. The need to establish interaction with civilian populations of state power, primarily in order to prevent obstruction(combat)actions, prompted to seek and embody a completely new in the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is based on the experience of NATO's armed forces. The CVS, in fact, became the first in the landscaping, formed according to the standards of the North Atlantic Alliance, which has been successfully performing the tasks for years in a row.</p>
<p><strong> <em>-If we turn to the experience of NATO member states, then the task is mostly in the territory of other states in international contingents, but we have war in our own territory .</em> </strong> **</p>
<p>-Indeed, the main feature of the direction of civil-military cooperation of Ukraine is that they work in the territory of their state and the widespread forces and the population.</p>
<p>At the initial stage, for the main tasks and functions that the units of the Civil-Military Cooperation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been laid, the basic functions of NATO CVS were based on <strong>: </strong> Organization of civilian-military interaction, support for troops(strength)and civilian objects, as well as relied on the experience of the United States Armed Forces. This fully corresponds to the challenges that have come to us.</p>
<p>An additional function, so to speak, is a national feature of search work and repatriation measures.</p>

<p><strong> <em>— You just told about the functions of the CVS, let us dwell on them .</em> </strong></p>
<p>-One of the main functions of the CVA in the Armed Forces is civil-military interaction, which provides for appropriate work and communication with state authorities, international non-governmental organizations and public associations of civilians.</p>
<p>Support for troops(strength)It is a priority function for CVD units. It is also not necessary to forget about the importance of evaluating the state of civil environment and informing commanders on the ground. This enables qualitatively predictable negative factors that can significantly affect the task with the appointments of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>In turn, supporting civil entities is to minimize the negative effects of hostilities on the civilian population. From the beginner -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the CVS units were faced with the need to provide humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilian populations(combat)actions and deoculated territories.</p>

It is a sustainable and extremely important area of work. Therefore, the Humanitarian Project of the Armed Forces of Ukraine "Evacuation 200" was started and temporary groups on transportation of the Image of the fallen soldiers were created, which was further renamed the humanitarian Project "on the shield".</p>
<p>Currently, the CEC of the General Staff of the Armed Forces created the management of search work and repatriation measures. This is due to the pre -suggestation of the search for the search and repatriation of missing and lacer. This activity is carried out in cooperation with expert services, law enforcement agencies and other units of security and defense forces.</p>
<p>It should be noted separately that only in the Armed Forces there is such specificity of work for the units of civil-military cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>-the consequences of a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation have demonstrated that civil-military cooperation should be considered primarily as a common function of all units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. What has changed during this time? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the priorities of the Tasks of the CVS in the launch have changed. The experience that the CVS has gained since February 24 last year is forcing some doctrinal documents and approaches to the tasks of the USS CVS. This is primarily due to the fact that, focusing on NATO standards, we adap them to use in the territory of our country, in the conditions of reflection of the Russian -scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.Our partners actively help us in the preparation of the personnel of the units of the CVS of the Armed Forces, which is constantly undergoing appropriate training both in Ukraine and abroad. Despite the fact that the war is ongoing, we will continue to study.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> - Thank you for such a meaningful conversation and on this occasion I congratulate you on your professional celebration!</strong></p>

<p>About it during a television marathon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WY8sDvZdWEA">"Unin"</a>The Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Anna Malyar told.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every rocket attack is perceived as something new and exclusive, because it is usually a loss and destruction. But if you look at the dynamics of action and war, no change in tactics is currently observed. The Russian Federation operates on the ability of its capabilities, adjusting the production of certain types of weapons. It is simply a course of war according to their current opportunities. Rocket shelling and drone attacks are checking the potential of our air defense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anna Malyar noted that the Russians are prone to symbolism. May 9 is their clause historical myth.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, what do they do to take Bakhmut by May 9? Now we draw as they pull the Nabakhmut direction from the entire front line of the Wagner Front. Where there were units of Russian paratroopers, representatives of the Wagner PEC are thrown into their nursing. I must say that the propaganda is also lagging behind. Not only the official media of the Tategram-channels, but also the heads of these private groups have intensified. On the other hand, Ukraine's Deborons resist and do not allow defense. Active assault actions are also also giving up. We already have the news that our fighters destroy the storage of ammunition from the Wagnets.</li>

<p>Today we have maintained the pace and strength of international work - all week gives Ukraine the necessary results.</p>
<p>In the morning, after returning from the Netherlands, he met with Bahrain Minister. This, by the way, is the first visit of the head of the police department of this country during our diplomatic relations - since 1992. That is another argument that the world not only believes in Ukraine, but also sees how our state strengthens.</p>
<p>We spoke to the minister with how we can bring peace to Ukraine together and restore peace and stability to international relations. I thanked the unchanging support of Ukraine and civilized rules, including support for the UN designer. We talked about the Ukrainian formula of peace, and I believe that Bahrain could join it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the summit took place on the anniversary of our state charity platformunited24. When the work of this platform began last May, we had a chief task - to unite ordinary people around the world, to unite for the advantage of Ukraine and to protect freedom. And it succeeded!</p>
<p>United24 has collected from different people, from different companies from 110 world countries. We have 15 star ambassadors. I am personally proud of the support from the part of our work for the sake of naval drones, as well as all projects that are related to the freezers for the front. These are thousands of drones that make Ukraine more powerful.</p>
<p>Much has been done within the UNITED24 medical direction, and the results of the reconstruction are also the results. Now we add another educational direction - it is the restoration of schools, as well as mine. The great task that Ukraine has faced and which can be launched not for decades, but for years, if there is sufficient global support. No Russian mines in our land should remain!</p>
<p>In the evening, he met with a delegation of the United States Congress. We were extinguished about the further interaction between our states for the sake of global consciousness.Also today was a meeting with representatives of the Venetian Commission, representatives of the Blackrock Investment Fund.</p>
<p>So, in a week: the United States and Bahrain, the Netherlands and Belgium, Finland Sweden, Norway and Denmark, Iceland. Canada. New Zealand. African Union and Comoros. But the whole multinational community of donors United24. We do our best for the world to hear Ukraine, to understand Ukraine and advised Ukraine. Because by helping us, the world protects itself.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that as a result of meetings in Helsinki and Hague we have a powerful development for our soldiers with weapons - on earth, in the air and at sea. I thank the partners!This is a significant intensification. We have more progress towards NATO and the European Union. We have more progress on Russia's responsibility for aggression against our state.</p>
<p>Glory to everyone and everyone who is now in battle for Ukraine, on combat missions at combat posts!Particularly grateful for this week to all the fighters of our air forces and all units of other kinds of troops defending the sky!</p>
<p>To stand, win and punish the enemy is our common task. In unity, daily making Ukraine stronger, daily adding new opportunities to our country, we will get to victory!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all our heroes of different times, who defended and protected Ukraine!</p>
<p>Glory to our people!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>This was emphasized by the Minister of Health of Ukraine Viktor Lyashko during the EU Member States Ministers, which included the heads of different institutions of EU Member States in the field of health care.</p>
<p>“It is very important for Ukraine to support the EU countries, as it is the European region that is our key partners in response to the truthful aggression of Russia. Health care is one of the most affected by war and one of the most loaded. We will fix the growth of demand for various types of medical care and services. Today, there is no hospital in Ukrainian, which would not be affected by a Ukrainian who is affected by the war. Every sixth health care institution physically felt in its own stands, which means the so -called "precision weapons" of Russia. Attacks on health care facilities are only part of a wider picture of deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools, universities, water and power supply systems, transport, warehouses, food stocks and more. All these exit are consciously, including for the purpose of pressure and intimidation of peaceful order. In more than 400 days, the aggressor did not realize that nothing would make the Ukrainians retreat. Just as no gas, energy or political hammer forced you, European partners, to deviate from the help of Ukraine to put the concessions of the country that started this war. I am grateful that the level of humanitarian support for Ukraine remains high, and the political trip to the aggressor continues to grow, ”the health minister Lyashko emphasized, addressing his European colleagues.</p>
<p>The minister added that Russia's full -scale war against Ukraine has created critical reception on the national health care system. To date, over 1,400 facilities of medical institutions, 177 - destroyed. Also, from the beginning, Russia damaged 103 "fast", another 250 destroyed and captured 125, almost700 pharmacies were attacked. Many countries have already taken care of some of the Tazaclade regions. Currently, the process is coordinated and the implementation of ambitious plans.Representatives of the EU Member States have confirmed their complete and unquestionable support for Ukraine in the war with the aggressor, as well as expressed their readiness and gave the realization to support Ukraine and cooperate within the projects. It is about supporting refugees from Ukraine, integration of mechanists and simplification of conditions for work for them in some EU countries, providing humanitarian assistance, development of services in the field of physical tapsychological rehabilitation, participation in the reconstruction of destroyed or damaged infrastructure, medical evacuation of Ukrainians. .</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health is also actively working for the direction of technology into the European community. Self-screening is conducted, a table of more than 600 documents is developed in accordance with EU requirements. Our goal is to establish a transparent system where Ukraine will be able to become a complete component of the medical space of the European region on equal terms and will be able to report these conditions.</p>
