 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in your conversation.
"Rate. Priority - advanced, specific issues of offensive. There were reporters and commanders directly from the directions of fighting. Also reporting Committee, Head of GUR.
Separately and in detail they considered the preparation and provision of new brigade Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time for combat actions.
In some directions, our warriors move forward, in some directions protect positions and oppose storms and increased attacks of the invaders. There will be lost positions. Only released. They have only losses. And in general-the resolution of pressure, our pressure, which allows you to pave the path of our flag. Syno-yellow colors will be throughout our south and throughout our east. Bommy is on their land, and it gives the greatest power.
I thank all our soldiers - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer of every general who is attracted to our active offensive and defensives now. I thank you for every liberated and for every protected position!
Today, in a conversation with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rice Sunak, defense needs as a time, thanked for the defense support. For example, the British "Svedou" - long -range missiles - make a very useful and accurate business at the front. Like many other weapons. And this cooperation will be a significant continuation.
Of course, they discussed with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister, preparing a NATO Vilnius summit and a meaningful filling of this Alliance meeting.
Today, there is also a significant political decision of Britain on sanctions - to keep junctions against Russia, until the aggressor compensates for all the damage caused to our country, our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all persons associated with it are related to the system of domination built by the Kremlin territory . It will be fair, and I am grateful to the British who support us on the path of justice.Both the conference and financial cooperation and our movement in the EU have discussed Ursula Der Lyen with the presidential community. Already this week we are expecting an intermediate oral evaluation of our work on the recommendations of the European Commission. And discussed in detail, the 11th sanctional package against Russia for the war.
He also spoke with the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte Tapremier, Denmark, Matte Frederixen. As always, they paid attention to the forefront and our joint defense efforts, thanked for their support and readiness to develop our cooperation for the sake of safety, " - the message reads.
The President also informed about negotiations with the leaders and representatives of Africa, who were in Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that Svetuvarto is more active in working with the formula of peace. Because only this formula is sufficiently reacting to every aspect of Russian madness.
Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post -war transformation of Ukraine. About those decisions about those steps, about the new doctrine of the new Ukraine, which wins Ukraine, - the quotes that we prepare and implement. All together. Just as we now expose this aggression.
“Thank you all who are in battle now, in combat posts, in combat positions!
Especially today I will note the assault unit of GRU "Artan" and its commissarayor Torkotyuk. Thank you!
And yet - our special operations. Victor, all the guys - thank you very much!
Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!" Said the President.

Декларації виробника будуть потрібні на литовській митниці з 3 липня придекларуванні товарів на експорт та реекспорт, а з 17 липня - і на митницях,які діють у пунктах прикордонного контролю.
З 5 червня Митний департамент застосовує суворіші перевірки для запобіганняможливому обходу санкцій та ввезення товарів до Росії — перевізники повинніподати документи, що підтверджують це. Проте статистика показує, щовідбувається паралельний імпорт деяких товарів до Росії та Білорусі.

Декларації виробника будуть потрібні на литовській митниці з 3 липня придекларуванні товарів на експорт та реекспорт, а з 17 липня - і на митницях,які діють у пунктах прикордонного контролю.

 The accusations of the Russian Federation against a foreign humanitarian law, the creation of "dirty bombs", the use of stored methods and means of warfare are void. Similar statements from the mouth of the Russian power sounded last fall, when the Russian invaders were defeated by the Front around Kherson.
About it reports Ministry of Defence Ukraine.
"The goal is quite clear: the authorities of Russia wants to distract from the obvious malesty of occupation troops at the front and to create distrust of Western allies of Ukraine," - said in the report.
Recall:
“The Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station was undermined by the Russians led to environmental and humanitarian -carastrophe. On the conscience of Russia - shelling of settlements of Ukraine, mass muddy of civilians, torture and execution of prisoners of war. If Russia speaks of the danger of war from someone - then it solves it itself. If Russia speaks of a "dirty bomb", it can be a real threat to its use by the Russians, " - said in the text of the message.
For its part, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine evaluates all scenarios and interconnections and together with other agencies and military administrations use measures to counteract the Russian threat.
