<p>“Due to the continuing invasive war of Russia against Ukraine, it is decided to suspend all the rights to participate athletes, coaches, instructors and other officials of sled sports in the RF competitions, sanctioned FIL. The presence of Russian representatives is related to the high rise for the safety, peacefulness and integrity of these competitions and the participants, including the Russian Federation itself, ”the testimony reads.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in March 2022, FIL forbade Russia and Belarus to participate in tournaments under its auspices in response to a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. In September of the same year, the International Sanity Federation for the second time was renovated by Russian and Belarusian sleds after Russia was able to fulfill its rights in the organization.</p>
<p>We thank the world sports community for the adamant support of Ukraine as well as the aggressor policy.</p>

<p>When meeting with people returning from the front, it is important to show the care of tasseling instead of pathos through flowers, orchestras and applause. It will help you feel the sincerity of your feelings and experiences.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/militarymediacenter/2281">reports</a>Military Mediacenter.</p>
<p><strong> Respect those who have come back from the front. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be prepared for the fact that a person who has gone to war can significantly change their life principles and views. It can also be expected that after the war it can change its attitude to material assets. * It is necessary to prepare the relatives of the military for the arrival of their loved ones from the front. Relatives should have information conversations in advance in order to know how to act in order not to cause injuries to soldiers in the family circle and how to support them in society during the adaptation period. * It is important to give the military time to deal with the issues of arriving from the front. If they are at rest, they will be able to resolve business issues and will not bring their weapons to home where there are children and will avoid conflicts with management in the future. This will allow them to relax after rotation. * It is important to learn how to critically perceive information when a native person is at the front. You should not trust the fighting information that comes from unverified sources, and you should not panic relatives at the front without evidence. * It is important to tell the fighters at the front that everything is well at home, as it is important for them to know that relatives have peace and peace.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> What don't need to do? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid conflicts and negative emotions that can return the military to the past in the war. * Do not try to understand the reality in which warriors live. * Do not ask about the dead brothers if the military does not want to talk about it. * Do not download household chores. Limit the military from family household cases for several months - be independent in solving tricky issues. * Limit conversations about the war and are not interested in the course of the fighting and the place of stay of the fighters, as it can create additional stress for them.</li>

<p><strong> In order not to be confused and panic during evacuation, parents remember some simple rules: </strong> **</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold the baby only by the hand. If your baby holds you by a sleeve or a bag, it can be very easy to get lost in the crowd. 2. Walking to the destination in the crowd, lead the children in front of you. 3. Always carry a picture of your baby with you(In particular, on the phone), preferably fresh. If the baby is lost, the picture of passers -by is easier to remember and help you find quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> How to prepare for evacuation: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Teach your child to know their own name, age, parents' names, home address, and, if possible, one parent contact number. 2. Sign her things. Indicate the contact person and phone number. 3. Additionally, put a business card with information about the contact person, copies of birth certificate and parents' passport data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> How to act if you found a lost baby: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find out the name of the child and where she is. Ask when she saw her parents or other adult who was with her. 2. Take the baby to a safe place. 3. Call a line 102 immediately, it may be already looking for relatives.</li>

<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/nemaye-u-derzhavi-zla-takih-fortifikacij-chi-rezerviv-yaki-z-83681">said</a>in your conversation.</p>
<p>"Rate. Priority - advanced, specific issues of offensive. There were reporters and commanders directly from the directions of fighting. Also reporting Committee, Head of GUR.</p>
<p>Separately and in detail they considered the preparation and provision of new brigade Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time for combat actions.</p>
<p>In some directions, our warriors move forward, in some directions protect positions and oppose storms and increased attacks of the invaders. There will be lost positions. Only released. They have only losses. And in general-the resolution of pressure, our pressure, which allows you to pave the path of our flag. Syno-yellow colors will be throughout our south and throughout our east. Bommy is on their land, and it gives the greatest power.</p>
<p>I thank all our soldiers - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer of every general who is attracted to our active offensive and defensives now. I thank you for every liberated and for every protected position!</p>
<p>Today, in a conversation with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rice Sunak, defense needs as a time, thanked for the defense support. For example, the British "Svedou" - long -range missiles - make a very useful and accurate business at the front. Like many other weapons. And this cooperation will be a significant continuation.</p>
<p>Of course, they discussed with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister, preparing a NATO Vilnius summit and a meaningful filling of this Alliance meeting.</p>
<p>Today, there is also a significant political decision of Britain on sanctions - to keep junctions against Russia, until the aggressor compensates for all the damage caused to our country, our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all persons associated with it are related to the system of domination built by the Kremlin territory . It will be fair, and I am grateful to the British who support us on the path of justice.Both the conference and financial cooperation and our movement in the EU have discussed Ursula Der Lyen with the presidential community. Already this week we are expecting an intermediate oral evaluation of our work on the recommendations of the European Commission. And discussed in detail, the 11th sanctional package against Russia for the war.</p>
<p>He also spoke with the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte Tapremier, Denmark, Matte Frederixen. As always, they paid attention to the forefront and our joint defense efforts, thanked for their support and readiness to develop our cooperation for the sake of safety, " - the message reads.</p>
<p>The President also informed about negotiations with the leaders and representatives of Africa, who were in Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that Svetuvarto is more active in working with the formula of peace. Because only this formula is sufficiently reacting to every aspect of Russian madness.</p>
<p>Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post -war transformation of Ukraine. About those decisions about those steps, about the new doctrine of the new Ukraine, which wins Ukraine, - the quotes that we prepare and implement. All together. Just as we now expose this aggression.</p>
<p>“Thank you all who are in battle now, in combat posts, in combat positions!</p>
<p>Especially today I will note the assault unit of GRU "Artan" and its commissarayor Torkotyuk. Thank you!</p>
<p>And yet - our special operations. Victor, all the guys - thank you very much!</p>
<p>Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!" Said the President.</p>

<p>Перелік, затверджений Митним департаментом, включає декілька десятків товарівподвійного призначення, які можуть бути використані у військових цілях або длязбільшення потужностей російської промисловості.</p>
<p>У декларації виробник повинен буде підтвердити, що знає продавця та покупцясвого товару у третій країні, а також те, що вони перевозитимуться транзитомчерез Білорусь чи Росію, що вони не будуть перепродані чи перевалені у цихкраїнах, і хто їхній кінцевий споживач знаходиться у третій країні.</p>
<p>Декларації виробника будуть потрібні на литовській митниці з 3 липня придекларуванні товарів на експорт та реекспорт, а з 17 липня - і на митницях,які діють у пунктах прикордонного контролю.</p>
<p>З 5 червня Митний департамент застосовує суворіші перевірки для запобіганняможливому обходу санкцій та ввезення товарів до Росії — перевізники повинніподати документи, що підтверджують це. Проте статистика показує, щовідбувається паралельний імпорт деяких товарів до Росії та Білорусі.</p>

<p>According to the calculations of the Lithuanian Bank, last year since the beginning of the war, total export from <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-litva">Lithuania</a>to Russia decreased by 4%, but exports to other countries of the Independent State Commonwealth increased by 4.2%(CIS).

<p>About it in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-vidbudova/3724771-oleksandra-azarhina-zastupnica-ministra-rozvitku-gromad-teritorij-ta-infrastrukturi.html">interview</a><a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-vidbudova/3724771-oleksandra-azarhina-zastupnica-ministra-rozvitku-gromad-teritorij-ta-infrastrukturi.html">Ukrinform</a>The Deputy Minister of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Azarchin reported.</p>
<p>“The previous standards for the distribution of funds of the FDRs took into account the population of Uregion and an indicator of gross regional product, as well as in fact depending on the political component. Any MP is not always ethical to "promote" his own project or not to support another, since 50% of the composition of the Commission to coordinate are members of the budget committee. Therefore, it turned out that sometimes the projects were only pyar in nature, not contributed to the economic development of the region, ”the Deputy Minister said.</p>
<p>According to her, if the document is approved, 50% of the funds from UAH 2 billion, which are foresected by the SPDR in 2023, will be distributed in equal parts of the interrudama regions, the remaining 50% will be additionally equal to 11 regions, which were more affected by hostilities. Central and local executive authorities and local self -government bodies will be able to submit projects for the implementation of the SFRR's brash through a specialized platform - action.</p>
<p>The most criticized document for preferences allegedly will have projections of acquired cities that will receive all <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-grosi">funds</a>Azarchin emphasizes. But the vote will take place within the region, so every Ukrainian will be able to choose the option that suits him most, is not just about a separate city. Financing will also take place not only for one project, but also those for which the funds will be sufficient and which will get a UNIONAL Rating.</p>

<p>"But they caught on this hook of" world -famous "experts like Illikiv, who, directly with foam into my mouth, told that I had died first there, then rose, then in whom I fell. Let people play, why not, ”the head of the GUR.</p>

Similar statements from the mouth of the Russian power sounded last fall, when the Russian invaders were defeated by the Front around Kherson.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/ministry_of_defense_ua/7702">reports</a>Ministry of Defence Ukraine.</p>
<p>"The goal is quite clear: the authorities of Russia wants to distract from the obvious malesty of occupation troops at the front and to create distrust of Western allies of Ukraine," - said in the report.</p>
<p>Recall:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is Russia that unjustifiably invaded the territory of Ukraine; * In 2022, Russia seized the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya NPP, placed weapons and ammunition there, shelling. The occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP is still used by the Russians as a blackmail factor.</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station was undermined by the Russians led to environmental and humanitarian -carastrophe. On the conscience of Russia - shelling of settlements of Ukraine, mass muddy of civilians, torture and execution of prisoners of war. If Russia speaks of the danger of war from someone - then it solves it itself. If Russia speaks of a "dirty bomb", it can be a real threat to its use by the Russians, " - said in the text of the message.</p>
<p>For its part, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine evaluates all scenarios and interconnections and together with other agencies and military administrations use measures to counteract the Russian threat.</p>

<p>Terror protection is the destruction of terrorists. And this is a guarantee that the state-gun will never be able to bring evil to Ukraine. Actually about the cetretic point for today. The first meetings in London have already begun within a conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine, which we prepared with British dogs. Discussions in Switzerland and Germany, France and Italy have already taken place. There is a work of different levels for our restoration. And we direct this work that our reconstruction, our restoration becomes not only construction projects, but a global protection project.</p>
<p>Ukraine, transformed Ukraine, reinforced Ukraine is a security and security guarantor, it is a security against any form of Russian terror protection against any repetitions of Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at the London Conference I will present some of the aspects of our philosophy of Ukraine. The full meaning will be represented later this month. And in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Together with partners and all together here, at home, in Ukraine, we must guarantee that after us for Ukraine - only safety, only freedom, only peace.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, the state-deputy speaker of Secretary General Farhan Gak said it.</p>

<p>According to him, the UN Secretary -General calls for the parties to accelerate the operations and persistently asks them to "make every effort to ensure the extension of this vital agreement, the validity of which passes on July 17."</p>
