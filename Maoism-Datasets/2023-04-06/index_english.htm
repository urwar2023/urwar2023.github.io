<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj.jpeg" />Mr. Head of the Senate, Mr. Head of the House of Deputies!</p>
<p>Thank you for your words, for such a good greeting.</p>
<p>I see our flag in you. Thank you for respect for our flag, our hymn, to my state!</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Dear members of the National Congress of Chile, Dear Representatives and representatives of theiplomatic corps, dear journalists!</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Let me start my appeal from one story. From the story of the place in which the children were drawing.</p>
<p>Ordinary children, but unusual drawings. On the walls. At school. In the basement.</p>
<p>In the village of Yaidny in our Chernihiv region, where Russian soldiers were transformed a regular rural school for a concentration camp.</p>
<p>They drove all the villagers there. All!In the basement. Children and adults. Of completely years old people. Women and men. Less than 200 square meters per 360 people.</p>
<p>You may have not heard of this place yet. But I want to tell you about him.</p>
<p>To tell about the walls of this basement in the berry, on which the children painted that any children in any country: friends, relatives, their lives, their rivers, football players, other of their heroes.</p>
<p>The children tried to write the lines of our hymn, which just sounded here, the lines on the walls ... And the adults were calculating. Also on the walls. How many days ago, the basement and how many people were killed, not withstanding these conditions. Their cutters are still on those walls. I was there yesterday, I saw it all.</p>
<p>From the third to March 30 last year, the concentration camp in the berry existed.</p>
<p>At the beginning, people were still released outside. One at a time. Sometimes. At least in the toilet.</p>
<p>And then they were deprived of it. No minute of the sun and the sky. The basement of the basement, crushing, dust and bucket instead of the toilet.</p>
<p>We know exactly about the ten dead there. People just couldn't stand it. Know about those who were then shot in the village, who disappeared.</p>
<p>And I do not want to talk public now that the occupiers started to do, the outlings said that the dead had to be buried.</p>
<p>It was hell on the ground. Hell that came to Ukraine with the Russian army.</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhere on your continent, in some countries there are still positive nostalgic memories about the period of relations with the Soviet Union or the tour, which it pretended to be after 1991. But now this concentration camp characterizes who we are dealing with.</p>
<p>Why did you need such bullying? What could be a motive to keep the whole village in inhumane conditions in the basement?And when we turn to weapons partners, we only turn out. And nearly 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages, our soldiers managed to liberate the Occupation. Berry - among them.</p>
<p>Many villages, towns and cities have experienced even worse mockery. They are just burned.</p>
<p>Imagine a once strong village, for example, the post-Pokrovsky Kherson region of Ukraine, in which more than 2 thousand people lived, and now almost all homes are broken. If it is accurate, 96% of damage to shelling. That's it that Russia came!</p>
<p>Imagine when there are only 50 such almost completely broken by war in the region alone.</p>
<p>Imagine a city that has been famous for decades with its industry, with your naval port. And now the city is dead. Killed by Russia. This is our Mariupol.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-1.jpeg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-1-150x150.jpeg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-2.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-2-150x150.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-3.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-3-150x150.jpeg" /></a>Imagine one of the greatest Ukrainian values, one of the greatest human values - fertile fields that have been welfare for centuries. In the south country, in the east as well.</p>
<p>The fields that are now contaminated with Russian mines. Often, Russian missiles are protruding from this earth from the volley fire systems, reminding that one state's aggression against another cannot be justified.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Almost 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages should be liberated from Russian evil!</p>
<p>This is why we have created a coalition of countries that help Ukraine's defeat national independence and the lives of our people.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I offered the formula of peace last fall - ten points that can return Ukraine to Ukraine, and to all of Europe and all over the world - stability, violated by Russian fascism.</p>
<p>This is what we seek support to you - to the Chilean people.</p>
<p>Life has the same value everywhere. The highest value. There is nothing that could have been liable to destroy the lives of peaceful people, the humiliation of peaceful people, the subjugation of free peoples and robbery attacks on other states for profit.</p>
<p>I am grateful to you, Republic Chile, for the fundamental condemnation of Russian aggression, with the support of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly.We form a global coalition to accomplish this and other similar tasks. And he is Yapti that we will fulfill them.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the world can not be the norm of burning cities and villages. There can be no normative, which someone wants to keep people in obedience. There can be no norm -concentration or filtration camps where people are driven and where people die.</p>
<p>The norms of wars as Russia now leads to Ukraine. And so, Russia itself, which it became, cannot and will not be the norm. It is a fascist state. State-Zlo. A state that deserves the legitimate and justification of the world is an attitude as a criminal.</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Ukraine invites you to join our peacekeeping efforts. Your voice in the Uonna Support for the Restoration of Ukraine's Security and Territorial Integrity is always very important.</p>
<p>Your participation in the implementation of our peace formula - which may not be a mere -human mineral demining - will accurately add an international order based on the rules.</p>
<p>I invite you to maintain our efforts for the food security of the world. This depends on the joint actions of all countries!</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the giant areas of our land are contaminated with mines or there are shelling, because Russia is blocking our ports and sea transportation to the Sea, the food market is destabilized.</p>
<p>We managed to unlock some of the supply. But the world needs more. Simply that the volume on the market and food prices on all continents are stable. You can be the leader of stabilization efforts from your continent!</p>
<p>Please support the efforts of the International Criminal Court, which has recently issued a warrant for the arrest of a Russian dictator in the case of the violent deportation of Ukrainian children into Russia and attempts to destroy their identity through assimilation and illegal adoption. With living relatives!</p>
<p>There is no such a crime that Russia would not have committed, conducting this war.</p>
<p>And there is no such people who could remain indifferent or neutral to evil.</p>
<p>Because we are all people. We all want the children of our peoples to be happy, security. They studied and rejoiced in life, not painted on the walls in captivity, in the cellars.</p>
<p>I thank you for your attention!Thank you for your support!</p>
<p>Let the dictatorship always lose, and life - always wins!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

Women who have been temporarily traveled outside the country opened businesses and branches of Ukrainian companies in different corners of the world. Many have made a relaxation within the state. This allowed us to survive the warfare of war, to keep the economy and these are the cases that we bring the day off today.

<p>In his turn, the Head of the Bureau of International Policy under the President of Poland Martinpsshidach reported on Thursday that Ukrainian grain should be exported from Poland.

<p>It is known that in recent months, Polish agrarians have been actively protesting against a significant influx into the Polish market of Ukrainian grain, which is a transit through Poland into third countries. As a result of mass protests, the Polish government called on the European Commission to restore a duty on Ukrainian. However, Evokomisi continued the duty -free regime with Ukraine for another year. This problem was resigned on April 5, the Minister of Agriculture Henryk, Henryk Kovalchyk, and a new Minister of Telus was appointed on Thursday.</p>

<p>About this during the event "Slow -acting weapons: how does Russia use the education of Ukrainian children and what to do with it to Ukraine?" In <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-presshall/3691938-zbroa-spovilnenoi-dii-ak-rosia-vikoristovue-osvitu-proti-ukrainskih-ditej-i-so-z-cim-robiti-ukraini.html"></a>The head of the independent investigative agency investigation said. Info Anna Babinets.</p>
<p>“When the Armed Forces began to be released Kherson and Kharkiv region, we saw that children are a very massive phenomenon. For example, in Kharkiv region there were occasions, when the children were exported to the camps and after that they were not turned. Educational bodies of the Russian Federation - accomplices of the abduction of children. They - universities, schools, universities, schools - offered such asvis, ” - the leader informed the investigation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783598-127.jpg" />She noted that in educational institutions in the occupied territories there were work of documents. In addition, they completed buses for such trips.</p>
<p>“Parents and children are likely to trust a school or university. When they are offered that the baby is going on vacation and then not returning - this is a statement. The children or parents themselves sometimes blame themselves, but it is wrong because they were misled by representatives of the Russian educational bodies, ” - emphasized Lababinets.</p>
<p>Valentina Potapova, Head of the Almena Civil Education Center, reported that more than a million Ukrainian children live in the occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, 458,000 children remain in the Crimea.</p>
<p>She noted that when the baby is at school, it is difficult for her not to be worried, because propaganda is everywhere.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783661-455.jpg" />“The children who remained there are victims of the purposeful policy, which is ascertained in order to raise children and young people in the spirit of the" great "state. A lot of money is allocated from the federal budget. It is also evaluated by informal education - youth movements, circles, ”said Potapova.</p>
<p>She also noted that in international humanitarian law, such educational violations are considered not as serious as, for example, the physical movement of children, so Russia feels impunity and continues to spread this system.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783717-157.jpg" />She emphasized that through textbooks, Russia calls for the creation of all -Russian ideas, which has an absorbing effect - other identities in the territory of Russia have the right to exist. According to her, this implies that, having a sesame of Russian identity, all people in the territory of the Russian Federation will be his patriots.</p>
<p>“The textbooks provide many examples of patriotic feelings when they laid their lives to lift the tank, break columnar and more. It is depicted as heroic actions, ”Podgorna said.</p>
<p>The lawyer also noted that these narratives flow smoothly in political substitute. In addition, she said, Russia prompts children not only to erod their identity, but also to reject any thoughts that Ukrainian Awaven has the right to exist.</p>

<p>“As an athlete, I can say that the competition, the Olympic Games is centenorm. At the same time, I do not understand how you can compete with them. We must do our best to bring our position to other federations. They are aim of helping us and preventing us in the competitions of Russian and Belarusian exports, ”the freestyler said.</p>

<p>He said it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“I have a serious injury: I broke the cruciform connection. We have surgery, the recovery will take 5-6 months. We plan to go out on Tatama in late autumn. The main thing is to take shape, then everything will be good. Next - the Olympiad. I'm already giving out to the Paris Games, I have a certain number of points. I am going to be more points to go there. It is necessary to complete what started. I just have already performed at the Olympiad. Now a medal is needed. I am updating at every Olympics, so I think it will be interesting at Paris Games. ” -Hammo said.</p>
<p>The judoist also emphasized that he did not understand how to compete with the Russians by the Iblorus at games, if they are allowed there.</p>
<p>“We are worried about it. Our coaches and senior comrades do a lot to prevent Russians and Belarusians from allowing the competition. Now it is omnipotent. Honestly, it is very difficult. In sports, athletes move pre -Olympiad, but also go out with them on one carpet - this is wrong. I think that the optimal option is to go to games, but not to fight them on these competitions, ”the judoist explained.</p>
<p>As it was reported, the new competitive year of Hammo began in January 2023 of the Grand Prix level in the Portuguese diamond. There, Jacob took the seventh place.</p>

<p>About it on Thursday in Beijing during a press conference following the meetings of the China's counterparts, the President of the European Commission Ursula von Der Lyen said, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“The relationship between the EU and China has a great effect on the wealth and safety of both. For China, the European Union is the first(By value - ed.)export -string, while for the EU China is the third(The most important)export -bypass. To give a specific figure - the volume of trade was more than 2.5 billion euros a day in 2022, ”the President of the European Commission said.</p>
<p>At the same time, she acknowledged that bilateral trade relations are becoming more and more likely. Over the past 10 years, the Trade Bank Union in trade with China has increased more than three times and reached 400 billion euros last year. This topic was discussed today by the PRC, because, according to Ursula von der Lyen, such a trajectory is not a resistant and requires a systematic solution to structural problems.</p>
<p>In particular, the President of the European Commission has attracted attention to the fact that in China's European business is often faced with the practice of dishonest competition in some peasters and restricting access to European companies to the Chinese market. This applies to, for example, supplies of agricultural products from the EU, medical devices or other goods. Practically excluded from the PRC market the result of the discriminatory policy of the state "buy Chinese".</p>

<p>All these circumstances are put by European companies that export to China, they have adjusted production in its territory, in unequal conditions with Chinese producers. This practice is a sharp contrast with the legal field that all companies use in a single EU market.She noted that there are different ways to reduce such risks. For example, to eliminate the risks associated with addiction, diversification of deliveries is used. In order to avoid the origins of the latest technologies, in particular, the defense sphere is to strengthen export control or screening. But in all cases, to solve the existing risks of the EU proposes the path of dialogue, the path of negotiations to find mutually acceptable solutions.</p>

<p>Data from the telescope demonstrate the unprecedented sensitivity of the observatory for the weakest dust rings of the planet.

Uranus has blue -drawny in a representative color image.</p>
<p>Due to the infrared radiation and additional sensitivity of the telescope, the new image contains more details, showing the dynamics of the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Also in the new photo can be seen bright clouds, which are generally typical of uranium in the infrared wave range, and are likely to be associated with shampower.</p>
<p>Uranus has 13 well -known rings, 11 of which are visible in a new image from telescowbba. Nine rings are classified as the main rings of the planet, and the other two are weaker rings.</p>
<p>Scientists expect that in the future, with the help of webba telescope, it will be possible to capture two weak external rings of the planet.</p>

<ul>
<li>We leave less and less positions to the occupiers, from where they can be damaged by mortars, artillery on the right bank, although they look for such positions. Over the past 24 hours, we have recorded 45 shelling of Kherson region and the single-burst of the Dnieper-Buzi estuary. That is, the enemy continues to hint that he is controlled by something, but can actually afford only a single outing. In particular, where social humanitarian aid is distributed, which is a classic sign of terrorism. We can state that the use of aviation bombs with managed aviation bombs is a step of despair, because there is nothing to use. Once again, I will see that the if they see a new tactic, we always search for her opposition, - Natalia Humeniuk said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The officer also reported that in the temporarily occupied Crimea the enemy continues the engineering arrangement of positions. All of these actions are tied to traditional methods, because creative thinking for Russians is not inherent. However, the trenches, in words, will not help the enemy - except to reduce the waiting time.</p>

<p>The threat of rocket attack always remains, as these missiles can reach any point in our country. Although, most likely, there will be no massive rocket launcher, it is still necessary to be serious about air alarm signals.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has also continued to strike the front line of the front line. The enemy applies managed aviation bombs, for a few hours the Ukrainian Right Bank was attacked - Russian criminals dropped the bombon agricultural enterprise. The terror of the civilian population continues.</p>
<p>Natalia Humeniuk also commented on the costs of the Russians in support of their fighting in the Black Sea.</p>
<ul>
<li>To talk about how expensive it is on the scale of the present war is not all appropriate, but such "entertainment" is not cheap. The way they try to prevail in the Black Sea and convince that the advantage of them is the most expensive. In particular, considering the anniversary of the "death" of the famous missile cruiser "Moscow", - she comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the officer spoke about the construction of trenches and bins of the temporarily occupied Ukrainian Crimea. In her opinion, it is the creation of an activity as an excuse that they at least try to do something.</p>
<ul>
<li>The expediency of these structures is quite doubtful, but let them get used to the ground, - summed up Natalia Humeniuk.</li>

<p>“This abomination killed 500 children. And with him there are some negotiations, they press their hand, they talk about something by phone or oh. It's nonsense, ”he said.</p>

Brap is simple and "not stitched", but it was attached to a conventional plastic pipe. In the middle of this homemade container, there was a plastid mixed with metal small impressive elements.

This tumor device with a drone is very dangerous, because it is difficult to detect it. In addition, the enemy applied this UAV during an artillery, when our infantry was in shelters.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to be careful and cautious, because the enemy can repeatedly use homemade explosive devices against the Ukrainian military.</p>

<p>One of the anonymous accounts was focused on users from the EU countries. This resource used this resource for attempts to discredit siloboron and distort historical facts about Ukraine.</p>
<p>The pro-Russian online agitator from Bucha was also detained. On the Platform "Classmates" he justified the military crimes of the invaders and popularized the group of "Wagner" and its owner Prigogine.</p>
<p>According to the SBU, during the occupation of Bucha, a man with his family was evacuated to the Carpathian region. At the same time, on the social network he regretted that the invaders failed to "take" Kiev in three days to drop the "Nazi regime".</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-06T89-00-00-04-00/ignat.jpg" />On the air of the "Uniform News", a spokesman for the Air Forces of Ukraine, the Colonel Yuriy Ignat, explained the position of Ukraine on the needs of the Western aircraft. In particular, modern technologies, even on modernized aircraft, will significantly improve the defense capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>I, military pilots and all Ukraine, of course, would like to see the figure of 35 <em>(F-35 "Lightning II" .</em>-<em>red).</em> Це один із найкращих літаків у світі на сьогодні,переозброїтись яким бажають усі країни, які нині мають на озброєнні F-16. Алеми мусимо тверезо дивитись на теперішній стан речей, і вже давно визначились,який літак ми найреалістичніше можемо отримати, — пояснив він.</li>
</ul>
<p>Саме літаки типу F-16 є у достатній кількості в багатьох країн-союзниківУкраїни, які вони можуть нам передати та навчити наших пілотів їхзастосовувати. Це є важливою ланкою у створенні української авіаційноїплатформи, літаки поколінь 4+ або 4++ можуть застосовувати різноманітний типозброєнь.</p>
<p>F-16 — це багатоцільовий літак, який може працювати як по повітряних цілях навеликих дистанціях, так і по наземних, зберігаючи при цьому високу мобільністьта оперативність застосування.</p>
<p>Юрій Ігнат також поділився подробицями щодо російських повітряних атак. Зайого словами, ворог почав використовувати керовані авіабомби типу ФАБ-500.</p>
<p>— Власне, окупанти знайшли звичайні фугасні авіаційні бомби ФАБ-500 масою у500 кілограм — це потужна зброя, бомби вільного падіння, які лишають післясебе великі воронки. І причепили до них крила та обладнали GPS-навігацією.Їхні літаки скидають ці бомби поза зоною ураження нашої ППО і уражаютьприфронтові райони, — зазначив речник Повітряних Сил.</p>
<p>Така тактика — це новий виклик для нашої оборони, який ЗСУ мають компенсуватидодатковими комплексами Patriot та SAMP/T. Але найкращий результат можепоказати лише бойовий літак.</p>
<p>— Найефективнішим, зрозуміло, буде F-16, який може застосовувати ракети навідстані до 180 км. Отже, якщо така авіація з’явиться в нас, ми зможемовідганяти російських окупантів далі від наших кордонів, — підсумував ЮрійІгнат.</p>
