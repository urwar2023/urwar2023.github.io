About it [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The head of the Press Center of Defense forces of South of Ukraine and the captain of Nataliagmenyuk during the direct ether of the "Unified News" TV.

- Most likely not all hostile ships are accordingly equipped, because we were not kept in activity. Nevertheless, we need to understand and realize that great power will be used. Against the background of the activity of tactical aviation, which we watched the widespread hours earlier in the southeast, we can talk about some preparation of rocket stroke, ”the officer added.

Natalia Humeniuk also does not exclude the fact that the enemy can use wave -shaped rocket attacks, that is, using different types of rockets of both rockets of both of both rockets.

- The enemy does not have so many rockets, so they will save them. We admit that the enemy's army will decide in this attack to use Shahhed UAV. Weather conditions at this stage are those that can contribute to such threats. Therefore, I call everyone to respond to air alarm signals - a rank and a rank.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj.jpeg)Mr. Head of the Senate, Mr. Head of the House of Deputies!

Thank you for your words, for such a good greeting.

I see our flag in you. Thank you for respect for our flag, our hymn, to my state!

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Dear members of the National Congress of Chile, Dear Representatives and representatives of theiplomatic corps, dear journalists!

Chilean people!

Let me start my appeal from one story. From the story of the place in which the children were drawing.

Ordinary children, but unusual drawings. On the walls. At school. In the basement.

In the village of Yaidny in our Chernihiv region, where Russian soldiers were transformed a regular rural school for a concentration camp.

They drove all the villagers there. All!In the basement. Children and adults. Of completely years old people. Women and men. Less than 200 square meters per 360 people.

You may have not heard of this place yet. But I want to tell you about him.

To tell about the walls of this basement in the berry, on which the children painted that any children in any country: friends, relatives, their lives, their rivers, football players, other of their heroes.

The children tried to write the lines of our hymn, which just sounded here, the lines on the walls ... And the adults were calculating. Also on the walls. How many days ago, the basement and how many people were killed, not withstanding these conditions. Their cutters are still on those walls. I was there yesterday, I saw it all.

From the third to March 30 last year, the concentration camp in the berry existed.

At the beginning, people were still released outside. One at a time. Sometimes. At least in the toilet.

And then they were deprived of it. No minute of the sun and the sky. The basement of the basement, crushing, dust and bucket instead of the toilet.

We know exactly about the ten dead there. People just couldn't stand it. Know about those who were then shot in the village, who disappeared.

And I do not want to talk public now that the occupiers started to do, the outlings said that the dead had to be buried.

It was hell on the ground. Hell that came to Ukraine with the Russian army.

Perhaps somewhere on your continent, in some countries there are still positive nostalgic memories about the period of relations with the Soviet Union or the tour, which it pretended to be after 1991. But now this concentration camp characterizes who we are dealing with.

Why did you need such bullying? What could be a motive to keep the whole village in inhumane conditions in the basement?And when we turn to weapons partners, we only turn out. And nearly 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages, our soldiers managed to liberate the Occupation. Berry - among them.

Many villages, towns and cities have experienced even worse mockery. They are just burned.

Imagine a once strong village, for example, the post-Pokrovsky Kherson region of Ukraine, in which more than 2 thousand people lived, and now almost all homes are broken. If it is accurate, 96% of damage to shelling. That's it that Russia came!

Imagine when there are only 50 such almost completely broken by war in the region alone.

Imagine a city that has been famous for decades with its industry, with your naval port. And now the city is dead. Killed by Russia. This is our Mariupol.

[![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T27-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-3-150x150.jpeg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-3.jpeg)Imagine one of the greatest Ukrainian values, one of the greatest human values - fertile fields that have been welfare for centuries. In the south country, in the east as well.

The fields that are now contaminated with Russian mines. Often, Russian missiles are protruding from this earth from the volley fire systems, reminding that one state's aggression against another cannot be justified.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Chilean people!

Almost 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages should be liberated from Russian evil!

This is why we have created a coalition of countries that help Ukraine's defeat national independence and the lives of our people.

For this purpose, I offered the formula of peace last fall - ten points that can return Ukraine to Ukraine, and to all of Europe and all over the world - stability, violated by Russian fascism.

This is what we seek support to you - to the Chilean people.

Life has the same value everywhere. The highest value. There is nothing that could have been liable to destroy the lives of peaceful people, the humiliation of peaceful people, the subjugation of free peoples and robbery attacks on other states for profit.

I am grateful to you, Republic Chile, for the fundamental condemnation of Russian aggression, with the support of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly.We form a global coalition to accomplish this and other similar tasks. And he is Yapti that we will fulfill them.

Everywhere in the world can not be the norm of burning cities and villages. There can be no normative, which someone wants to keep people in obedience. There can be no norm -concentration or filtration camps where people are driven and where people die.

The norms of wars as Russia now leads to Ukraine. And so, Russia itself, which it became, cannot and will not be the norm. It is a fascist state. State-Zlo. A state that deserves the legitimate and justification of the world is an attitude as a criminal.

Chilean people!

Ukraine invites you to join our peacekeeping efforts. Your voice in the Uonna Support for the Restoration of Ukraine's Security and Territorial Integrity is always very important.

Your participation in the implementation of our peace formula - which may not be a mere -human mineral demining - will accurately add an international order based on the rules.

I invite you to maintain our efforts for the food security of the world. This depends on the joint actions of all countries!

Due to the fact that the giant areas of our land are contaminated with mines or there are shelling, because Russia is blocking our ports and sea transportation to the Sea, the food market is destabilized.

We managed to unlock some of the supply. But the world needs more. Simply that the volume on the market and food prices on all continents are stable. You can be the leader of stabilization efforts from your continent!

Please support the efforts of the International Criminal Court, which has recently issued a warrant for the arrest of a Russian dictator in the case of the violent deportation of Ukrainian children into Russia and attempts to destroy their identity through assimilation and illegal adoption. With living relatives!

There is no such a crime that Russia would not have committed, conducting this war.

And there is no such people who could remain indifferent or neutral to evil.

Because we are all people. We all want the children of our peoples to be happy, security. They studied and rejoiced in life, not painted on the walls in captivity, in the cellars.

I thank you for your attention!Thank you for your support!

Let the dictatorship always lose, and life - always wins!

Thank you!

Glory to Ukraine!

Viceremier-Minister noted that this year's commission was the largest wetting of it, and emphasized the importance of Ukraine's presence at such global events to prevent the promotion of Russian narratives in the middle countries.

“In some elements of the UN system that are involved in the humanitarian response of the humanitarian law, the presence of Russia is very high. Therefore, it is critical of us to use all the possibilities to prevent any manipulation and spread of propaganda theories by Russia. This is especially important at such sites where not only NATO countries are present, but also the countries of Asia, Africa and those regions with which we have a permanent united agenda, ”-said the head of the Ukrainian delegation Viceremier-Minister on European Affairs and Euro -Atlantic integration Olga Stephanyshyn.

The Government noted that for Ukraine, the key task during all the day was to attract the attention of the world community to the criminal actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, their influence on the lives of citizens and the position of women in particular.Olga Stefanishina noted that another through the commission was supporting Ukrainian women, including temporarily displaced abroad.

“The war has forced women to take on the role of the economic driver of both their family and the country as a whole. Women who have been temporarily traveled outside the country opened businesses and branches of Ukrainian companies in different corners of the world. Many have made a relaxation within the state. This allowed us to survive the warfare of war, to keep the economy and these are the cases that we bring the day off today. This experience should also be taken into account in the post -war restoration of the country and to translate the role of women in the economy, ”Olga Stephanyshyn added.

The participants also noted that the experience of a full -scale invasion of in Ukraine, in particular, was the reason for reviewing the resolution of the UN Security Council 1325 "Women. Security ”for the period up to 2025, where Ukraine managed to deduct our national priorities. Another important achievement of the Ukrainian delegation within the commission was the accession to the newly created global alias to counteract sexual violence during conflicts, where Ukraine is a half -head until the end of 2023.

“The Alliance will tell even more about the crimes that the Russians do to the tasis will make our voice louder in the international arena. In addition, the task is to bring the inclusion of victims of sexual violence in the process of developing taralization of politicians at international and national levels. This will allow to promote the client orientation of the provision of services to the victims and the dialogue with them, ” - said the Government Commissioner for Gender Policy Katerynalovchenko, Vice head of the Ukrainian delegation.

Separately referred to prevention and counteraction to domestic violence. Olgastfanishina stressed that in the war, the issue of counteracting domestic violence is becoming completely different. It becomes one of the consequences of the war, so it is important to rethink and adapt to the new realities of relevant state policy.The event was held on the initiative of the Viceremier Office for European European Atlantic integration together with the Government Commissioner of Gender Equality with the UN support of the UN, within the framework of the Project "Transformational Approaches to Achieving Gender Equality in Ukraine".

“Mechanisms will be developed in the coming days that will stop such exports [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zerno)which has led to the dostabilization of the food market of Poland to this day.

In his turn, the Head of the Bureau of International Policy under the President of Poland Martinpsshidach reported on Thursday that Ukrainian grain should be exported from Poland. According to him, it will require the development of infrastructure, transport cordors and border compaction, so that it is not possible to speculate the Navora market with Ukrainian grain, which is intended for the countries of Africa of the and Baby East.

It is known that in recent months, Polish agrarians have been actively protesting against a significant influx into the Polish market of Ukrainian grain, which is a transit through Poland into third countries.

About this during the event "Slow -acting weapons: how does Russia use the education of Ukrainian children and what to do with it to Ukraine?" In [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-presshall/3691938-zbroa-spovilnenoi-dii-ak-rosia-vikoristovue-osvitu-proti-ukrainskih-ditej-i-so-z-cim-robiti-ukraini.html)The head of the independent investigative agency investigation said. Info Anna Babinets.

“When the Armed Forces began to be released Kherson and Kharkiv region, we saw that children are a very massive phenomenon. For example, in Kharkiv region there were occasions, when the children were exported to the camps and after that they were not turned. Educational bodies of the Russian Federation - accomplices of the abduction of children. They - universities, schools, universities, schools - offered such asvis, ” - the leader informed the investigation.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783598-127.jpg)She noted that in educational institutions in the occupied territories there were work of documents. In addition, they completed buses for such trips.

“Parents and children are likely to trust a school or university. When they are offered that the baby is going on vacation and then not returning - this is a statement. The children or parents themselves sometimes blame themselves, but it is wrong because they were misled by representatives of the Russian educational bodies, ” - emphasized Lababinets.

Valentina Potapova, Head of the Almena Civil Education Center, reported that more than a million Ukrainian children live in the occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, 458,000 children remain in the Crimea.

She noted that when the baby is at school, it is difficult for her not to be worried, because propaganda is everywhere.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783661-455.jpg)“The children who remained there are victims of the purposeful policy, which is ascertained in order to raise children and young people in the spirit of the" great "state. A lot of money is allocated from the federal budget. It is also evaluated by informal education - youth movements, circles, ”said Potapova.

She also noted that in international humanitarian law, such educational violations are considered not as serious as, for example, the physical movement of children, so Russia feels impunity and continues to spread this system.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T15-23-29-03-00/1680783717-157.jpg)She emphasized that through textbooks, Russia calls for the creation of all -Russian ideas, which has an absorbing effect - other identities in the territory of Russia have the right to exist. According to her, this implies that, having a sesame of Russian identity, all people in the territory of the Russian Federation will be his patriots.

“The textbooks provide many examples of patriotic feelings when they laid their lives to lift the tank, break columnar and more. It is depicted as heroic actions, ”Podgorna said.

The lawyer also noted that these narratives flow smoothly in political substitute. In addition, she said, Russia prompts children not only to erod their identity, but also to reject any thoughts that Ukrainian Awaven has the right to exist.

This helps Russian propaganda. The matter is being investigated now, and I am not able to disclose the details, but the children's protection commission had reason to temporarily plot children in this family, ”Pavel Sadoha added.

It is noted that "positive, though deeply depressed" economic activity in 2023 reflects a softer decline [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika)Russian Federation and improvement of Ukraine's prospects. In general, the regional economy will increase on average to 2.7%during 2024-2025 against the background of inflation reduction, restoration of domestic repayment and improvement of the environment.

Among the negative factors that influenced economic growth in Europe and central Asia, there is a sharp increase in consumer prices, especially on food and energy. This led to an increase in inflation in 2022 to 15.9% in developing markets, for which it is the highest in over 20 years, and so as the most among all developing regions.

Як передає Укрінформ, про це повідомляє [](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/lukoil-group-in-bulgaria-fined-e100-million-for-abusing-dominant-position/).

"This can prevent, restrict or distort competition and influence consumer interests by limiting the import of motor fuel to the country," the commission was summed up.

The investigation of the CPC was focused on the behavior of "Lukoil Naftohim Burgas" and "Lukoil [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bolgaria)”And found that the group has been granted the law, without giving importers and manufacturers of motor fuel to access the tax warehouses.

It is also noted that Lukoil has restricted imports of marine routes, blocked the warehouses related to the oil terminals of "Rosenets" and "Petrol-Varna" and not secured access to the petroleum products for transportation of fuel to other producers and importers.

The Lukoil group has the most extensive storage infrastructure in Bulgaria related to its transport infrastructure, and together with the high proportion of storage market of automobile fuel is the dominant enterprise of Ukraine.

However, according to the CPC, the group uses a strategy that includes several -competitive practices, which, in series and cumulative application for more than five years, create obstacles to fuel imports, or hinder this process, or making it economically ineffective.

** Read also: ** [** Lukoil **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3666773-na-zavodi-lukojla-u-rosii-stalasa-pozeza.html)This approach allows the Russian Lukoil to maintain the leadership positions of Vubolgaria at the level of wholesale and retail trade.

According to the LUC, Lukoil abuses its dominance both under the law and EU legislation, since the restriction of imports into Bulgaria can significantly affect the scheme of trade in the Member States.

As reported by Ukrinform, the Polish State Oil and Gas Concern PKN ORLENCE has corrupted a contract with the Russian company "Tatnafta" without payment of penalties after stopping the supply of oil from the Russian Federation.

Everyone understands what is happening. How can our Ukrainian athletes perform with the athletes? It is necessary that the IOC cannot make a decision on the admission on its own, so it translates the responsibility to international federations and recommends to allow the Russians of Iblerus to the competition, ”Abramenko said.

The Olympic champion stressed that Ukraine and its partners should press the International Federations so that Russians and Belarusians do not return to games.

“As an athlete, I can say that the competition, the Olympic Games is centenorm. At the same time, I do not understand how you can compete with them.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T18-45-00-03-00/630_360_1680795825-546.jpg)Ukrainian judoist Jacob Hammo spoke about his injury and further plans for the punishment.

He said it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.

“I have a serious injury: I broke the cruciform connection. We have surgery, the recovery will take 5-6 months. We plan to go out on Tatama in late autumn. The main thing is to take shape, then everything will be good. Next - the Olympiad. I'm already giving out to the Paris Games, I have a certain number of points. I am going to be more points to go there. It is necessary to complete what started. I just have already performed at the Olympiad. Now a medal is needed. I am updating at every Olympics, so I think it will be interesting at Paris Games. ” -Hammo said.

The judoist also emphasized that he did not understand how to compete with the Russians by the Iblorus at games, if they are allowed there.

“We are worried about it. Our coaches and senior comrades do a lot to prevent Russians and Belarusians from allowing the competition. Now it is omnipotent. Honestly, it is very difficult. In sports, athletes move pre -Olympiad, but also go out with them on one carpet - this is wrong. I think that the optimal option is to go to games, but not to fight them on these competitions, ”the judoist explained.

As it was reported, the new competitive year of Hammo began in January 2023 of the Grand Prix level in the Portuguese diamond. There, Jacob took the seventh place.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T19-31-00-03-00/630_360_1665159965-212.jpg)The trade and economic relations between the EU and China are unbalanced and reflected, but the parties have huge volumes of trade, which last year amounted to more than 2.5 billion euros per day.

About it on Thursday in Beijing during a press conference following the meetings of the China's counterparts, the President of the European Commission Ursula von Der Lyen said, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“The relationship between the EU and China has a great effect on the wealth and safety of both. For China, the European Union is the first(By value - ed.)export -string, while for the EU China is the third(The most important)export -bypass. To give a specific figure - the volume of trade was more than 2.5 billion euros a day in 2022, ”the President of the European Commission said.

At the same time, she acknowledged that bilateral trade relations are becoming more and more likely. Over the past 10 years, the Trade Bank Union in trade with China has increased more than three times and reached 400 billion euros last year. This topic was discussed today by the PRC, because, according to Ursula von der Lyen, such a trajectory is not a resistant and requires a systematic solution to structural problems.

In particular, the President of the European Commission has attracted attention to the fact that in China's European business is often faced with the practice of dishonest competition in some peasters and restricting access to European companies to the Chinese market. This applies to, for example, supplies of agricultural products from the EU, medical devices or other goods. Practically excluded from the PRC market the result of the discriminatory policy of the state "buy Chinese".

All these circumstances are put by European companies that export to China, they have adjusted production in its territory, in unequal conditions with Chinese producers. This practice is a sharp contrast with the legal field that all companies use in a single EU market.She noted that there are different ways to reduce such risks. For example, to eliminate the risks associated with addiction, diversification of deliveries is used. In order to avoid the origins of the latest technologies, in particular, the defense sphere is to strengthen export control or screening. But in all cases, to solve the existing risks of the EU proposes the path of dialogue, the path of negotiations to find mutually acceptable solutions.

It was reported that last week French President Emmanuel Macron opened the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Lien to make a joint venture to discuss and find a solution for problematic issues of overcomes between Europe and China, in particular in the fields of economy and policy, human rights, and more. Currently, both European leaders are in China. During the meeting with the President of the SI, they raised the issues of protecting the Russian war in Ukraine and achieving a just peace.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-webb-scores-another-ringed-world-with-new-image-of-uranus).

Data from the telescope demonstrate the unprecedented sensitivity of the observatory for the weakest dust rings of the planet. Their image was able to get only by stepping [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kosmos)Voyager-2 ship in 1986 and Keck Observatory, which has advanced adaptive optics.

Uranus has blue -drawny in a representative color image.

Due to the infrared radiation and additional sensitivity of the telescope, the new image contains more details, showing the dynamics of the planet's atmosphere.

Also in the new photo can be seen bright clouds, which are generally typical of uranium in the infrared wave range, and are likely to be associated with shampower.

Uranus has 13 well -known rings, 11 of which are visible in a new image from telescowbba. Nine rings are classified as the main rings of the planet, and the other two are weaker rings.

Scientists expect that in the future, with the help of webba telescope, it will be possible to capture two weak external rings of the planet.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-06T20-07-35-03-00/630_360_1669378255-230.jpg)China should make a decision whether he or she will actively manifest its position on the war in Ukraine and will be aside aside.

The adviser to the head of the Presidential Office Mikhail Podolyak expressed this opinion in the Ethizhagal TV Teleterna "Unified News", Ukrinform reports.

"China today makes whether it will be active in this war itself to manifest itself, whether it will stand aside. It would certainly be desirable to get a telephone conversation between the presidents [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj)Tukraine. Today we hear that there are such signals, but let's wait for the conscience. There will be logistics, let's talk about it. But it seems to me that I have changed significantly. I emphasize: has changed significantly. And this position is not a dietary, as the Russian Federation emphasized for a long time, "Podolyak said.

- We leave less and less positions to the occupiers, from where they can be damaged by mortars, artillery on the right bank, although they look for such positions. Over the past 24 hours, we have recorded 45 shelling of Kherson region and the single-burst of the Dnieper-Buzi estuary. That is, the enemy continues to hint that he is controlled by something, but can actually afford only a single outing. In particular, where social humanitarian aid is distributed, which is a classic sign of terrorism. We can state that the use of aviation bombs with managed aviation bombs is a step of despair, because there is nothing to use. Once again, I will see that the if they see a new tactic, we always search for her opposition, - Natalia Humeniuk said.

The officer also reported that in the temporarily occupied Crimea the enemy continues the engineering arrangement of positions. All of these actions are tied to traditional methods, because creative thinking for Russians is not inherent. However, the trenches, in words, will not help the enemy - except to reduce the waiting time.

About it [stated](https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/ua/Diialnist/6243.html)Secretary of the Radinational Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexey Danilov.

The NSDC Secretary of Ukraine, first of all, urged to mention all Ukrainian children whom the order of Putin was killed. He was indignant with the fact that the Kremlin's steering wheel "still pressed his hand".

“This abomination killed 500 children. And with him there are some negotiations, they press their hand, they talk about something by phone or oh. It's nonsense, ”he said.

Alexei Danilov was outraged by the speech by the Russian "Commissioner for the Rights of the Child" by Maria Lviv-Bielova during an informal meeting of the UN Security Council, Yakusklika of the Russian Federation, to discuss "evacuation" of Ukrainian children from the area of combatants.

According to the Secretary of the NSDC of Ukraine, it is now necessary to change the institutions of international institutions, to bring them into compliance with "forever".

"I think this time has come, and all the efforts of the Russians in some way will be worthless," he said.

They discussed the continuation of the contract of servicemen who are back. Their contracts automatically continue, as in all other defenserants, until the end of martial law and a special order.

In addition, loved ones are worried that they have information about their defenders in captivity, such as photos or videos from captivity, but in the National Information Bureau(NIB)They are accounted for as disappeared or as those that are likely to be captured.

According to the norms of international humanitarian law, prisoners account for only things whose captive was confirmed by Russia through the International Committee of the Red Cross. Then the type of accounting in Nib is replaced by "captive". But, as the representatives of the coordination headquarters have been emphasized more than once, most of those who have already been released were accounted for as missing. It does not interfere with the exchange of people. However, photo and captivity videos are taken into account.

“Photos and videos cannot always carry reliable information. They should be carefully checked. But at least we and loved ones know that a person is alive, Russian is kept. So they are responsible for her, ”the headquarters representative said.

He also noted that exchanges are carried out in accordance with the negotiation positions. For example, the return of wounded or seriously ill or women, not for a list of cutters:

“When our and Russian ombudsmen in Turkey discussed the repatriation of the wealthy and we made a list of several hundred people, the Russians were only one of one one. But they did not even want to return. "

In particular, modern technologies, even on modernized aircraft, will significantly improve the defense capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

- I, military pilots and all Ukraine, of course, would like to see the figure of 35 _(F-35 "Lightning II" ._-_red)._ Це один із найкращих літаків у світі на сьогодні,переозброїтись яким бажають усі країни, які нині мають на озброєнні F-16. Алеми мусимо тверезо дивитись на теперішній стан речей, і вже давно визначились,який літак ми найреалістичніше можемо отримати, — пояснив він.

Саме літаки типу F-16 є у достатній кількості в багатьох країн-союзниківУкраїни, які вони можуть нам передати та навчити наших пілотів їхзастосовувати. Це є важливою ланкою у створенні української авіаційноїплатформи, літаки поколінь 4+ або 4++ можуть застосовувати різноманітний типозброєнь.

F-16 — це багатоцільовий літак, який може працювати як по повітряних цілях навеликих дистанціях, так і по наземних, зберігаючи при цьому високу мобільністьта оперативність застосування.

Юрій Ігнат також поділився подробицями щодо російських повітряних атак. Зайого словами, ворог почав використовувати керовані авіабомби типу ФАБ-500.

— Власне, окупанти знайшли звичайні фугасні авіаційні бомби ФАБ-500 масою у500 кілограм — це потужна зброя, бомби вільного падіння, які лишають післясебе великі воронки. І причепили до них крила та обладнали GPS-навігацією.Їхні літаки скидають ці бомби поза зоною ураження нашої ППО і уражаютьприфронтові райони, — зазначив речник Повітряних Сил.

Така тактика — це новий виклик для нашої оборони, який ЗСУ мають компенсуватидодатковими комплексами Patriot та SAMP/T. Але найкращий результат можепоказати лише бойовий літак.

— Найефективнішим, зрозуміло, буде F-16, який може застосовувати ракети навідстані до 180 км. Отже, якщо така авіація з’явиться в нас, ми зможемовідганяти російських окупантів далі від наших кордонів, — підсумував ЮрійІгнат.
