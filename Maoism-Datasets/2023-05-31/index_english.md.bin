A representative of the US National Security Council Johnkirby said this at a briefing in the White House, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"President Biden has three key priorities for the last 15 months. The first is to support Ukraine, and I have just announced a new package, so I think it is quite clear that we are doing it," the US administration said.

The second priority, according to him, is the support of NATO allies: “They have made our presence up to 100,000 soldiers only on the European continent and keep them there to protect(Allies - ed.)But to be sure that we fulfill our obligations to the Eastern Flang. "

The third priority is to avoid the Third World War. In this connection, Kirbin has outlined that the involvement of the United States and other NATO countries is not respectively in the interests of the US national security, but also detrimental to Ukraine's interests.

At the same time, he emphasized that the United States does not dictate Ukraine, where to self -stroke: "We do not tell them how they should carry out their operations. We provide them with weapons, teach them, and give advice."

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-31T-25-51-00-03-00/630_360_1683214927-997.jpg)Increasing electricity tariffs is a forced step so that the energy industry can take the next winter.

The Deputy Minister of Energy Farid Safarov said this on the air of the Teleterna "One News", Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Since October 10, 2022 and for the next six months, the Ukrainian power system was one of the goals # 1 for the enemy. During this time, rapid rockets and drones were released by energy infrastructure. And unfortunately, there were 270 hits, 33 massive attacks, ”he informed.

According to the Deputy Minister, as a result of shelling, the Ukrainian energy system infactly in the history of mankind suffered such a level of losses that the world bank as of February 2023 estimated at more than $ 11 billion.

Safarov added that this figure is constantly growing, because firing of energy infrastructure occurs daily, especially in frontline areas.

Unfortunately, the raising of tariffs is one of the key tools, how we can do it," the minister said.

He noted that Ukraine receives a large amount of humanitarian aid, funding of projects to restore energy infrastructure, but this is not enough.

“And so that(Tariff increase - ed.)- The forced step is that we can pass the passing winter, " - explained Safarov.

The deputy suggested that with the onset of the cold, the power system again becomes the precision target for the enemy, so the funds are needed to have time to make the repair of the destroyed infrastructure necessary for the winter.

The National Commission for State Regulation in the field of electricity of such such services has turned to the government with a proposal in two stages to increase [tariffs](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tarif)To the market level, it is 5.5 UAH per kW.

In this context, he clarified that on average, one family increase in electricity will lead to an increase in payments by approximately 250 UAH per month.

At the same time, the Deputy Minister assured that the state understands the risks of increasing prices for certain categories of population, so it will provide subsidies.

According to Ukrinform, the SPSU reports on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=774002707514562).

“Belarussian border guards!You recently mentioned the similarity of the Belarusian Tukraine borscht with minor differences. However, you, as always, are very bad. Your borscht is very different from ours. Because nowadays, the Belarusian borschcad is similar to Russian, even if you add more potatoes there.

“Imagine forever in your memory and in your culinary book that Ukrainians are a nation. We always fight for our independence. Instead, you are not capable of this and have been captured by one tyrant and one -bunner grandfather for many years.

According to Ukrinform, it reports [press service of the Ukrainian Clubagrarian Business](https://www.ucab.ua/ua/pres_sluzhba/novosti/na_vnutrishnomu_rinku_boroshnomelnoi_produktsii_ukrainski_virobniki_postupovo_vitisnyayutsya_mizhnarodnimi).

Зазначається, що безпосередньо з Польщі до України за результатами першогокварталу 2023 року було імпортовано агропродукції майже на 262,7 млн євро. Цейістотно більше, ніж імпорт за аналогічний період 2022 року (nearly 93.2 mlneurovro)and 2021(Almost 76 million euros).

В УКАБ зауважують, що, крім безпосереднього імпорту, до переліку ввезеної доУкраїни продукції також входить і гуманітарна допомога у вигляді харчовихпродуктів, що надається європейськими країнами, зокрема Польщею.

Загальний імпорт агро-харчової продукції з ЄС до України скоротився з майже3,2 млрд євро у 2021 до 3 млрд євро у 2022 році, але деякі держави - члени ЄСзмогли наростили свої поставки агропродукції.

Зокрема, експорт агро-харчових товарів з Польщі до України за 2022 рік зріс на133 млн євро (+16%)- up to 945 million euros.

Experts explain that growth [import](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-import)Part of the product groups was caused by lack of products in the inner market of Ukraine. It is primarily about the products of the vegetable group; some meat and milk products and eggs; as well as about alcoholic and non -alcoholic and tobacco products(Some transnational factories stopped work in 20122 and replaced their products with imports from Poland).

Thus, according to the Union of Flour Meals of Ukraine, Ukrainian producers were partially displaced from the Ukrainian retail of other regions of Ukraine by cheaper Polish and Turkish products(paste, pasta, etc.). В асоціації наголошують, що здешевлення продукціївідбулось за рахунок використання у виробництві менш дороговартісногоукраїнського зерна, що було імпортоване до Польщі та Туреччини, починаючи здругої половини 2022 року.

**Читайте також:** [ Кабмін заборонив експорт цукру](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3716172-kabmin-zaboroniv-eksport-cukru.html)The identical situation in the Ukrainian market has developed with dairy and meat products, the UKAB noted.

At the same time, due to the lack of liquid funds, Ukrainian producers lose European suppliers in the Battle for a place on the supermarket shelf - retail will be a prerequisite for a rather long time of refund for sales.

Considering the stable economic situation, the lack of hostilities of and hallistic challenges, European companies have the best positions for the implementation of Ukrainian retail.

If this trend is maintained in the UCAB, there is a risk of further demanding of Ukrainian grain processors and producers of flour milling products in international(including European)manufacturers. This, in its own, will have a significant negative impact on the internal processors of grain production.

According to Ukrinform, according to the Institute of Agrarian Economy, the EU in the first quarter of 2023 became the largest supplier [food](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-produkti)to Ukraine.

He stated this in an interview with the publisher of The Wall Street Journal Almar Latur, Ukrinform reports, citing [office of Poland President](https://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wypowiedzi-prezydenta-rp/wywiady/prezydent-czynimy-wszystko-by-nato-bylo-jak-najsilniejsze,69268).

Duda noted that today it is often possible to hear that Putin has lost the war, as evidence of this is allegedly the accession of Finland to NATO. However, he warned that in fact the Russian dictator has not lost any war.

“I hope Vladimir [Putin](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin)loses. In the meantime, we have a situation where a Russian rink presses Ukraine, where hundreds of people die daily, ”the President of Poland said.

He noted that the Russians are more than 100 million, and Ukrainians are less than 40 million, so this difference alone shows who has the advantage in this war. This shows the difference between the cultures of both peoples.

“Russia is a nuclear state, it has giant weapons. From the fact that we think that Russia pulls tanks of the 1960s, because every tank weighs 50-60 ton. If he goes - he crushes, regardless of whether he is modern or not.

“Please do not doubt that they can propagate people to tighten the Easter cakes every time, and even if they are hungry, they should be proud, Bossa is great. Today, our common duty as a community of the West, part of Poland, is the support of Ukraine, ”Duda stressed.

The President of the RP noted that Poland and ordinary Poles have been actively fulfilled by Ukraine since the beginning of the war. He stressed that according to Polish estimates in 2022, Poland provided assistance to Ukraine worth $ 7-8 billion, which is 1.5% of GDPPolshi.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-31T22-51-00-03-00/630_360_1683214927-997.jpg)Increasing electricity tariffs is a forced step so that Ukraine's energy industry may be the next winter.

The Deputy Minister of Energy Farid Safarov said this on the air of the Teleterna "One News", Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Since October 10, 2022 and for the next six months, the Ukrainian power system was one of the goals # 1 for the enemy. During this time, rapid rockets and drones were released by energy infrastructure. And unfortunately, there were 270 hits, 33 massive attacks, ”he informed.

According to the Deputy Minister, as a result of shelling, the Ukrainian energy system infactly in the history of mankind suffered such a level of losses that the world bank as of February 2023 estimated at more than $ 11 billion.

Safarov added that this figure is constantly growing, because firing of energy infrastructure occurs daily, especially in frontline areas.

Unfortunately, the raising of tariffs is one of the key tools, how we can do it," the minister said.

He noted that Ukraine receives a large amount of humanitarian aid, funding of projects to restore energy infrastructure, but this is not enough.

“And so that(Tariff increase - ed.)- The forced step is that we can pass the passing winter, " - explained Safarov.

The deputy suggested that with the onset of the cold, the power system again becomes the precision target for the enemy, so the funds are needed to have time to make the repair of the destroyed infrastructure necessary for the winter.

The National Commission for State Regulation in the field of electricity of such such services has turned to the government with a proposal in two stages to increase [tariffs](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tarif)To the market level, it is 5.5 UAH per kW.

In this context, he clarified that on average, one family increase in electricity will lead to an increase in payments by approximately 250 UAH per month.

"President Biden has three key priorities for the last 15 months. The first is to support Ukraine, and I have just announced a new package, so I think it is quite clear that we are doing it," the US administration said.

The second priority, according to him, is the support of NATO allies: “They have made our presence up to 100,000 soldiers only on the European continent and keep them there to protect(Allies - ed.)But to be sure that we fulfill our obligations to the Eastern Flang. "

The third priority is to avoid the Third World War. In this connection, Kirbin has outlined that the involvement of the United States and other NATO countries is not respectively in the interests of the US national security, but also detrimental to Ukraine's interests.

"There is no difference between" For the House Ready "and" Glory to Ukraine ". These are the most renowned chauvinists of the Western [Ukraine](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina)who have cooperated with the Nazis and killed thousands of Jews, Poles ... I am badly heard in Croatia, "he said.

Information from cameras can be obtained from online broadcasting through a streaming-naval platform or through a hacker "fracture".

The SBU also emphasizes that it is forbidden to shoot and publish photographs on the activity of defense forces and the consequences of hostile shelling. The extension of such records is a crime that provides punishment for up to 12 years.

Today, when all of Ukraine successfully opposes the undercover and treacherous enemy, it is extremely important not to give the invaders even the slightest opportunity to adjust the shelling.

So, we ask to be vigilant and follow security recommendations!

The spokesman stressed that the UN condemned any attacks on civilian objects.

According to him, the position of the UN Secretary General Guterresh on the attacks of nuclear infrastructure remains unchanged.

"But in no way one can compare the attack of drones on Moscow with the currents of Ukraine that are happening constantly," he stressed.

About this [reported](https://www.msp.gov.ua/news/22850.html?fbclid=IwAR3xL4aNN7AT-i-_s7rgUwqxELehUDCB6fUTYf-ctq2YO4S98dId6w_s2yY)at the official social policy page.

As of today, only about 20% of people with disabilities in Ukraine are worn. Instead, in the EU countries, this figure in average exceeds 55%. The best is to change the situation for the Project of the Law 5344-d to promote employment of persons with disabilities.

The project is intended, in particular, to change the inefficient system of punishment of employment of employment on motivational mechanisms for supporting employers who provide the work of persons with disabilities.

Among the main innovations of the bill can be distinguished:

* dissemination of a system of employment of persons with disabilities not only to the private but also to the public sector; * targeted use of special fund funds solely for employment of people with disabilities; * expansion of categories of enterprises that can receive financial support to ensure employment of persons with disabilities; * enterprises that meet certain criteria can obtain the status of labor integration enterprises; * involvement in the mechanism of employment of persons with disabilities of private recruitment agencies; * Mandatory inclusion in the mechanism of employment of social services(social accompaniment at the workplace, personal assistant, translation by signal language and others).

Важливо зазначити, що законопроєкт усуває бар’єри у працевлаштуванні осіб зінвалідністю, серед яких через війну вже зараз чимало ветеранів російсько-української війни. Ухвалений документ забезпечить можливості для всіх, хтопрагне реалізувати свій професійний потенціал у нових реаліях.

"The right of armed conflicts regulates armed conflicts and is an integral part of the preparation of Ukrainian recruits in the United Kingdom to prepare their daily activities at the forefront," the Ministry of Defense of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland said in the Ministry of Defense.

The classes are aware of the principles of the right of armed conflicts, the rules for the treatment of prisoners of war and detained persons. The Armory forces of Ukraine steadily, systematically and fully adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law in counteracting unjust, illegal and aggressive war against Ukraine.

It is the unconditional observance of the norms and following the principles of international humanitarian law that distinguishes the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the Russian Federation's military forces and provides international support for Ukraine, since the values of Ukraine and the free democratic world are joint taoda as well as the desire to protect them.

Instead, the use of prohibited remedies and methods of hostilities by the Russian Federation has led to large -scale, irreparable casualties, civilian infrastructure and environmental consequences. Such actions are regular military crimes of the Russian Federation. Crimes not used by the limitation periods and for which the personation is not envisaged.

According to him, the main tasks of the Marines are the protection of maritime databases, as well as the capture of the bridgeheads, which is held by the enemy. For this purpose, marine infantry units must be trained accordingly and have the necessary equipment and equipment.

At the same time, before the capture of the bridgehead, a marine landing - a complex type of operation performed at sea should be carried out. These are the complexes that are carried out before the foot of the Marines will take the shore. The Marine Corps alone will not solve such tasks.

Viecadmiral Alexei Shepap reported that the depicted storage arms will be in service with the swimming armor, and the means of delivery of this equipment will be the ship composition of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since after capturing the bridgehead, further imposing forward will require a certain independence of management and approval of decisions, for this purpose a corps is created.

According to the commander of the Navy of Ukraine, the number of personnel of the Marines will be increased by the creation of new brigades and other units - artillery, security, support.

- All these plans are being implemented now, we do not have time to wait at the completion of Vivna, - said Viceadmiral Alexei Shepap.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, this opinion was voiced(https://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wypowiedzi-prezydenta-rp/wywiady/prezydent-czynimy-wszystko-by-nato-bylo-jak-najsilniejsze,69268) Канцелярія польського президента.

«Для росіян людське життя нічого не означає, для українців кожне життя — навагу золота. Це — інша культура. росія — ядерна держава, у неї — гігантськісклади зброї. І нічого сміятися, коли вона викочує танки 1960-х років, бокожен танк важить тонн 50-60. Якщо він рухається, то давить, незалежно відтого, чи він сучасний. путін програє війну, коли російську армію будевідкинуто від міжнародно визнаних кордонів України. Тоді ми скажемо, що вонинічого не виграли від цієї війни, що їхній план поневолення Українипровалився, їхні імперські амбіції були покарані, вони втратили сотні тисячлюдей», — сказав польський президент.

### **Спільний обов 'язок країн Заходу — підтримати Україну**

Президент Польщі застеріг: російська економіка переходить на військові рейки,і роспропаганда зробить усе, аби переконати людей, що вони повинні затягнутипояси тугіше. І навіть якщо росіяни будуть голодними, пропагандистипромиватимуть мізки громадянам, мовляв, ті повинні пишатися, бо росія начебтовелична.

«Сьогодні наш спільний обов'язок як співтовариства Заходу, частиною якого є іПольща — підтримати Україну. Ми розуміємо, що російський імперіалізмвідроджується і якими будуть наслідки. Ми розуміли, що малося на увазі, колиросіяни побудували «Північний потік» в обхід Центральної Європи. Ми чудоворозуміємо, що означає російський енергетичний шантаж. Ця пам'ять — у нашихсім'ях», — нагадав Анджей Дуда.

### Лише поразка рф ознаменує настання безпечних часів для світу

Водночас глава Польщі пояснює, чому країна однією з перших після початкуширокомасштабного наступу росії на Україну зголосилася допомогти українськимбіженцям.

He added that only Russia's defeat will marry the onset of safe times for the world.

“We know that only the victory over Russia means that we will be safe - the Baltic States and Poland, as well as the countries of Western Europe.

** I remind our German neighbors that the Russians were in Berlin. **

** I remind my colleagues from France that they were also in Paris in Napoleonic Epoch **, ”Andrzej Duda said.

Russian Rer's Russian Cletes fix the serial numbers of the mobile phones of our military, downloading it all into a single base on all fronts, so Russians can determine - which troops where they moved, that is, for example, these 50 phones were Podkherson - now these 50 phones in Bakhmut. That is, the conclusion is that the unit is translated here,-said the military expert in the field of Rer and Rebsergiy Beskrestnov, who is better known to the Ukrainian audience as Sergei Flash.

According to him, when you go to the front, it is best to take another phone to take at least a seven card.

- We can forbid all the military to use telephones, they will understand it, but everyone has families who are close, everyone wants to be associated with them. Thank God, the instinct of self -preservation at "zero" suggests our military switch off phones. That's right, they cannot be touched. But the situation changes from the front line. 5 kilometers - a little possible to call, and 10 kilometers - in general. No one is embarrassed that there is 10 km and 15 km, and the artillery also gets there, ”Sergey Flesh said.

The first is the solution of military tasks, because to reflect them we use our air defense we and we have some resources. But this is not commensurate with what damage these drones and missiles could be caught in the event of a set for a certain purpose.

The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar told about it in the Evirithelovia Marathon "Unified News".

- Second, Kyiv from the point of view of the Russian Empire is the object of their terrible historical jealousy. Therefore, constant attacks on the capital, the Russians try to grate all their images and pain, as well as to add to us, because the capital of any country is the embodiment of strength, protection,-said Anna Malyar.

The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine explained that active shelling of Kyivazagarbniki is trying to show the vulnerability of our symbol of resistance. Aircraft alheresults become a significant counter -argument for the enemy.

- The Russians act irrationally and emotionally, adjusting to certain "sacred" dates or symbols. Therefore, by the time of our victory, we have to be advised that each of us constantly cares for our own safety. There is air anxiety - we are hiding in a safe place, - summed up Hannamal.

Today is a working trip to our Odessa.

He thanked our soldiers here for the protection of the region and all Ukraine. In particular, he visited the hospital, our wounded defenders. He wished a speedy recovery. There was an honor to hand over state awards. He thanked our doctors.

He held a special and long -term meeting on security and social confidence in the region. The management of the region, military, law enforcement.

The area is a priority in all views. It is Odessa region that is one of the foundations of our south, and therefore the state.

Very important results are in Odessa region in the Security Service of Ukraine in the counter -fighting sabotage.

There was a report by General Moskalov on the situation in the areas of responsibility Odessa. Detailed how to strengthen the defense.

They discussed in detail economic issues, jobs, social disabilities.

Held a field meeting. The constant attention of the front. Reports of commander - "Khortytsia", "Tavriya", head. Special reports of GUR and SBU leaders. Details - later. Special attention is our grain corridor, safety in the marriage.

The world knows what fundamental role our marine grain export plays for food security. And in general, the safety in the Black Sea, the effectiveness of international law against navigation is a globally important security facility. All the maritime countries of the world now see that they can threaten their exports, their waters if Russia gets off the hands of the navigation of the navigation of the Sea.

Here is just one example. Currently, of the three ports that were agreed within the Small Sea Grain Initiative, the Southern port is actually blocked. About one and a half million tons of agricultural products have been accumulated in one "Southern". At least ten countries, including Turkey, Egypt, Bangladesh, and China, are expected. Obviously, the less food is supplied to Kamirain, the higher the prices of food there, the more people lose from their family budgets.

That is, the blockade of one port in Ukraine creates extremely serious risks for different peoples. Moreover, in particular for those, which Russia still has to speculate.

And I thank everyone in the world who helps us to increase the safety space of the Sea, who presses on Russia to unlock food supply.

He also held a meeting today on the development of our port infrastructure.

And one more.And now I thank the United States of America, personally by Biden President, the Obsec Parties of Congress and every American - to all who value freedom - for a new defense package for our soldiers. Petriots missiles, Himars missiles, artillery and other weapons. Need right now!

Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle for Ukraine, who is on combat missions. Thank you all who work for our country!

** _ Thank you, Odesso, for this day!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

The expatate helped the RFF military propaganda measures. To do this, he attracted equipment and resources under his enterprises.

Among other things, the attacker was engaged in the deployment of Russian military, repair equipment, provided food and gave his own equipment for the removal of fortifications.According to the SBU, the person involved is hiding from justice in the temporarily seized territories of Ukraine. Complex measures are ongoing to hold his responsibility.

Expdeate is threatened with life imprisonment. His corporate rights, trade facilities and bank accounts have already been transferred to the Office of the National Agency of Ukraine on Implication, Investigation and Management of Assets(Arma).
