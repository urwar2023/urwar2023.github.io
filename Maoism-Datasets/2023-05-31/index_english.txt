"There is no difference between" For the House Ready "and" Glory to Ukraine ". These are the most renowned chauvinists of the Western Ukraine who have cooperated with the Nazis and killed thousands of Jews, Poles ... I am badly heard in Croatia, "he said.
In turn, the Adinian of the Presidential Office of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak advised Milanovich is not living the myths of Russian propaganda and added that today it "already has a senseless look."

The world knows what fundamental role our marine grain export plays for food security. And in general, the safety in the Black Sea, the effectiveness of international law against navigation is a globally important security facility. All the maritime countries of the world now see that they can threaten their exports, their waters if Russia gets off the hands of the navigation of the navigation of the Sea.
Here is just one example. Currently, of the three ports that were agreed within the Small Sea Grain Initiative, the Southern port is actually blocked. About one and a half million tons of agricultural products have been accumulated in one "Southern". At least ten countries, including Turkey, Egypt, Bangladesh, and China, are expected.

“The communities of the Kherson region in a very difficult situation: part is occupied, some suffer from shelling, trying to restore the destroyed infrastructure. It is important that with the support of the U-LEAD Berislav community, it is possible to improve the project that will give it hope for energy independence, create additional workplaces, improve ecology and help economic development. It is sure that this practice of the Berislav community will be an example for others, " U-LEAD with Europe "in the Kherson region Oksana Silyukova.
Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, nine -month occupation and hostilities under the Beryslav community provoked powerful energy. Destroyed high -voltage transmission lines, damaged gas distribution systems. Infrastructure restoration requires considerable money. Therefore, in the community, they decided to create an alternative to coal and gas and use local biofuels - straw for heating buildings.
With the support of U-LEAD with Europe, the project "Improving the energy independence of the Berislav city community by creating fuel briquettes" is being implemented here, which provides for the organization of production of briquettes of the power management system. The local U-LEAD subsidy was held on this initiative by the NGO Ber and Slava.
The community is agrarian. After de -occupation and demining in its territory, several agricultural enterprises are functioning in its territory, which can ensure the supply of large volumes of straw.
“As part of the project, we acquire a line for the production of fuel briquettes with a capacity of 300 kg of finished briquettes for 1 hour. The trial batch of products will be useful for heating one of the kindergartens of our community. And the raw material we are consumed from local agrarians, " - said the head of Nataliastarodubets Natalia.Activists plan to popularize alternative fuel and carry out information and explanatory measures for community residents.

“The creation of briquettes will develop our community. Every year after the harvesting fields and the Beryslav community, a huge amount of straw is stamped in the Beryslav district. If it is recycled into fuel bryquets, you can save high -calorie coal. In addition, ownership sources of energy can become a powerful incentive for the development of a local economy, ”Starodubets said.
Straw briquettes are an inexpensive, environmentally friendly, calorie fuel that responds to the European standards. They can be burned in large boiler rooms and small boilers, tubs, and furnaces. In the process, the unpleasant odor does not spread, they are smoky, do not shoot, do not form soot and carbon monoxide.

 In 2023, the European Union was imported from the European Union to Ukraine, which was 285 million euros exceeded by the 285 million euros of the 285 million euros and by the export of the ZACAGEGRAPHIP 2022 and by 107 million euros - the indicator for the first quarter2021.
According to Ukrinform, it reports press service of the Ukrainian Clubagrarian Business .
Зазначається, що безпосередньо з Польщі до України за результатами першогокварталу 2023 року було імпортовано агропродукції майже на 262,7 млн євро. Цейістотно більше, ніж імпорт за аналогічний період 2022 року (nearly 93.2 mlneurovro)and 2021(Almost 76 million euros).
В УКАБ зауважують, що, крім безпосереднього імпорту, до переліку ввезеної доУкраїни продукції також входить і гуманітарна допомога у вигляді харчовихпродуктів, що надається європейськими країнами, зокрема Польщею.

Загальний імпорт агро-харчової продукції з ЄС до України скоротився з майже3,2 млрд євро у 2021 до 3 млрд євро у 2022 році, але деякі держави - члени ЄСзмогли наростили свої поставки агропродукції.
Зокрема, експорт агро-харчових товарів з Польщі до України за 2022 рік зріс на133 млн євро (+16%)- up to 945 million euros.
Experts explain that growth import Part of the product groups was caused by lack of products in the inner market of Ukraine. It is primarily about the products of the vegetable group; some meat and milk products and eggs; as well as about alcoholic and non -alcoholic and tobacco products(Some transnational factories stopped work in 20122 and replaced their products with imports from Poland).
Thus, according to the Union of Flour Meals of Ukraine, Ukrainian producers were partially displaced from the Ukrainian retail of other regions of Ukraine by cheaper Polish and Turkish products(paste, pasta, etc.). В асоціації наголошують, що здешевлення продукціївідбулось за рахунок використання у виробництві менш дороговартісногоукраїнського зерна, що було імпортоване до Польщі та Туреччини, починаючи здругої половини 2022 року.

At the same time, due to the lack of liquid funds, Ukrainian producers lose European suppliers in the Battle for a place on the supermarket shelf - retail will be a prerequisite for a rather long time of refund for sales.
Considering the stable economic situation, the lack of hostilities of and hallistic challenges, European companies have the best positions for the implementation of Ukrainian retail.
If this trend is maintained in the UCAB, there is a risk of further demanding of Ukrainian grain processors and producers of flour milling products in international(including European)manufacturers. This, in its own, will have a significant negative impact on the internal processors of grain production.
According to Ukrinform, according to the Institute of Agrarian Economy, the EU in the first quarter of 2023 became the largest supplier food to Ukraine.

Ми не повинні дозволяти путіну продовжувати урізати європейськубезпеку, і для цього нам потрібна структура, яка забезпечує довгостроковубезпеку України», — сказав Єнс Столтенберг.

«Для росіян людське життя нічого не означає, для українців кожне життя — навагу золота. Це — інша культура. росія — ядерна держава, у неї — гігантськісклади зброї. І нічого сміятися, коли вона викочує танки 1960-х років, бокожен танк важить тонн 50-60. Якщо він рухається, то давить, незалежно відтого, чи він сучасний. путін програє війну, коли російську армію будевідкинуто від міжнародно визнаних кордонів України. Тоді ми скажемо, що вонинічого не виграли від цієї війни, що їхній план поневолення Українипровалився, їхні імперські амбіції були покарані, вони втратили сотні тисячлюдей», — сказав польський президент.
Спільний обов 'язок країн Заходу — підтримати Україну 
Президент Польщі застеріг: російська економіка переходить на військові рейки,і роспропаганда зробить усе, аби переконати людей, що вони повинні затягнутипояси тугіше. І навіть якщо росіяни будуть голодними, пропагандистипромиватимуть мізки громадянам, мовляв, ті повинні пишатися, бо росія начебтовелична.
«Сьогодні наш спільний обов'язок як співтовариства Заходу, частиною якого є іПольща — підтримати Україну. Ми розуміємо, що російський імперіалізмвідроджується і якими будуть наслідки. Ми розуміли, що малося на увазі, колиросіяни побудували «Північний потік» в обхід Центральної Європи. Ми чудоворозуміємо, що означає російський енергетичний шантаж. Ця пам'ять — у нашихсім'ях», — нагадав Анджей Дуда.
Лише поразка рф ознаменує настання безпечних часів для світу 
Водночас глава Польщі пояснює, чому країна однією з перших після початкуширокомасштабного наступу росії на Україну зголосилася допомогти українськимбіженцям.
He added that only Russia's defeat will marry the onset of safe times for the world.
“We know that only the victory over Russia means that we will be safe - the Baltic States and Poland, as well as the countries of Western Europe.
I remind our German neighbors that the Russians were in Berlin. 
I remind my colleagues from France that they were also in Paris in Napoleonic Epoch , ”Andrzej Duda said.

He thanked our soldiers here for the protection of the region and all Ukraine. In particular, he visited the hospital, our wounded defenders. He wished a speedy recovery. There was an honor to hand over state awards. He thanked our doctors.
He held a special and long -term meeting on security and social confidence in the region. The management of the region, military, law enforcement.
The area is a priority in all views. It is Odessa region that is one of the foundations of our south, and therefore the state.
Very important results are in Odessa region in the Security Service of Ukraine in the counter -fighting sabotage.
There was a report by General Moskalov on the situation in the areas of responsibility Odessa. Detailed how to strengthen the defense.
They discussed in detail economic issues, jobs, social disabilities.
Held a field meeting. The constant attention of the front. Reports of commander - "Khortytsia", "Tavriya", head. Special reports of GUR and SBU leaders. Details - later. Special attention is our grain corridor, safety in the marriage.
The world knows what fundamental role our marine grain export plays for food security. And in general, the safety in the Black Sea, the effectiveness of international law against navigation is a globally important security facility. All the maritime countries of the world now see that they can threaten their exports, their waters if Russia gets off the hands of the navigation of the navigation of the Sea.
Here is just one example. Currently, of the three ports that were agreed within the Small Sea Grain Initiative, the Southern port is actually blocked. About one and a half million tons of agricultural products have been accumulated in one "Southern". At least ten countries, including Turkey, Egypt, Bangladesh, and China, are expected. Obviously, the less food is supplied to Kamirain, the higher the prices of food there, the more people lose from their family budgets.
That is, the blockade of one port in Ukraine creates extremely serious risks for different peoples. Moreover, in particular for those, which Russia still has to speculate.
And I thank everyone in the world who helps us to increase the safety space of the Sea, who presses on Russia to unlock food supply.
He also held a meeting today on the development of our port infrastructure.
And one more.And now I thank the United States of America, personally by Biden President, the Obsec Parties of Congress and every American - to all who value freedom - for a new defense package for our soldiers. Petriots missiles, Himars missiles, artillery and other weapons. Need right now!
Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle for Ukraine, who is on combat missions. Thank you all who work for our country!
_ Thank you, Odesso, for this day!_
