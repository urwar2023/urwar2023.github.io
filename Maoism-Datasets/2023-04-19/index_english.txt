“The propagandist Keoosyan stated that with the phrase of the“ brotherly people ”about the Ukrainians to“ tie ”. She seems to confuse people.
He also added that the Russians were fighting in the fields of "their" Ukraine with "Ecumenical Evil".
In these words, Keosan destroyed the long -standing narrative of Rospropaganda about the "brother -in -law of Ukraine".
The disgraced propagandist also began to justify the murders of peaceful Ukrainian terrorists of the Wagner PEC, although earlier all Putin media stated that Russian was not able to commit such crimes
The birth of new narratives indicates that all the previous ones are not justified by the Kremlin. Also, it is likely to be evidence that Russia is trying to create a new occasion for large -scale mobilization of Russia. "

When Europeans and people all over the whole, in North America and the whole world see my peacekeeping, how women rape women and kidnap children, forcibly take away their forcibans - then they really care about it, ”Jens Stoltenberg added.He noted that the "grain" problem should find its solution, but it is not aware of any lack of will and the readiness of the Allies to continue supporting Ukraine.

Indeed, because they cannot lead with foul fights, because they lose in them, they resorted to their proven Syrian tactics and actually erased from the face of the building of the building. In this state, it is difficult to hold positions. In fact, they can not be kept in such aspiration.

 In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a fair system of payments should be operated, which does not increase the prerequisites for social tension in combat units and will be heard to those soldiers who risk their own lives and health.
On this emphasized In the General Staff, commenting on the discussions on the decision of the Parliament to repay the payments to the military 30 thousand hryvnias.
“Society is discussing a rather sensitive issue, namely: the decision of the parliament to declare an additional monetary remuneration for servicemen in the amount of 30 thousand UAH.
A soldier who serves and protects the country from the aggressor, risking his own life and health, performs tasks in difficult conditions, should be highly motivated. Remember what a coal, Marinka or Avdiivka look like. Each day of Ukraine's defense is given to us at a very high price. The cost of life and healthy defenders, ”the message reads.
Therefore, the additional monetary reward is accrued depending on the districts and the complexity of the tasks performed by fighters. 
The General Staff of the Armed Forces noted that 100 thousand hryvnias per month, as before, are preserved to defenders who are fighting directly at the front country.
30 thousand are paid to the military who perform tasks in the areas of combatants but do not directly participate in the fighting with the enemy, proportional to the time of completion task.
If servicemen are out of the war zone, in the rear, then the sub -tax payments to them are not accrued .
At the same time, as of February 1, 2023, all servicemen have been raised by the minimum amount of monetary support to 20100.
"We ask you to stop engaging in populism and concentrate on the defense of our state," - called on the General Staff of the Armed Forces.

from a thousand to three thousand non -taxable minimum income in the event of a first offense(from 17 thousand UAH to 51 thousand UAH); * from three thousand to eight thousand non -taxable minimum incomes with deprivation of the right to occupy individual positions for a period of up to three years in case of re -offense(from 51 thousand UAH to 136 thousand UAH); * from 10 thousand to 15 thousand non -taxable minimum incomes with deprivation of the right to occupy individual positions for up to three years, if the offense was committed by an official with the use(from 170 thousand UAH to 255 thousand UAH).

As reports The Government Portal, Oleksandr Kubrakov noted: “On the agenda, the main issue is the dislocation and ensuring the effective functioning of the Black Sea Race Race. They agreed on registration renewal and inspection of the court arriving under the loading of Ukrainian grain.
On April 10, Russia has stopped registering a new entrance fleet to participate in a vines and refused to work on the plans of Ukrainian ports. This is made by the assembly of inspection plans and actually stopped the entry of new vessels with the framework of the grain initiative.
It is known that in the last two days, on April 17-18, no inspection was drawn up and no inspection was carried out in Turkey's territorial waters. The 18th Ukrainian side suggested to carry out at least 2 inspections of the output 2 inspection of the entrance fleet. This proposal was also supported by the Turkish Storone, but was not implemented because of Russia's position.
In demanding regulation of the activities of Ukrainian ports by determining the vessels that can participate in the initiative, Russia has violated the official procedure procedure and terms of the grain agreement in particular.
The requirements to control and interfere with the work of Ukrainian ports are unacceptable to us.
I am grateful to Turkish Defense Minister Akaru Hulus for a constructive dialogue of the Tacitka position to support the work of the grain initiative. Despite that the inspections of the ships will be renewed, we continue working consultations with the UN Tattoochyna regarding ways to ensure the full fulfillment of the grain agreement to fulfill the obligations of all parties and procedures of the SCC.
