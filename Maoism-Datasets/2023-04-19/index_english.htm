<p>“The propagandist Keoosyan stated that with the phrase of the“ brotherly people ”about the Ukrainians to“ tie ”. She seems to confuse people.</p>
<p>He also added that the Russians were fighting in the fields of "their" Ukraine with "Ecumenical Evil".</p>
<p>In these words, Keosan destroyed the long -standing narrative of Rospropaganda about the "brother -in -law of Ukraine".</p>
<p>The disgraced propagandist also began to justify the murders of peaceful Ukrainian terrorists of the Wagner PEC, although earlier all Putin media stated that Russian was not able to commit such crimes</p>
<p>The birth of new narratives indicates that all the previous ones are not justified by the Kremlin. Also, it is likely to be evidence that Russia is trying to create a new occasion for large -scale mobilization of Russia. "</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice also plans to send a permanent legal advisor to the US Embassy in Kiev this summer. This adviser will work with Ukrainian partners on a number of difficult issues of the justice sector.</p>
<p>Prosecutors who work with a group of investigation of the US Department of Justice, continue to cooperate closely with colleagues at the Office Prosecutor of Ukraine to investigate specific crimes committed by Russian troops, including illegal attacks on civilians.</p>
<p>The US Congress has recently expanded the powers of the Ministry of Justice on judicial reversal of likely war criminals, which were found in the United States. This means that in the coming years and decades, Russian warriors who have been in the United States should expect that they will find themselves in the USA.</p>
<p>In addition, the US Ministry of Justice applies new powers given to the US Congress to transfer certain assets that have confiscated from Russian oligarchs to use Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We will do our best to help Ukraine achieve justice for their people. And we will work as much as we need to be held responsible for those who are responsible for the cruel crimes of the Russian regime, ”said US Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>

In addition, the Russian Federation is losing up to 150 tanks in Ukraine on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>According to Ukrinform, this is stated in the report of the Center of Strategic and International Research(CSIS), informs <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/19/europe/russia-weapons-production-report-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"></a>.</p>

<p>In particular, Moscow lost up to 3.5 thousand tanks per year of the war, with about 500 units of a modernized T-72B3 tank, first staged by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in 2013.</p>

But Russia is losing an average of almost 150 tanks of all types in Ukraine on an monthly report.</p>
<p>As for optical systems, Russia relied on French imports.</p>
<p>Through sanctions, it is forced to install old, less perfect sights even their most up -to -date tanks, which leads to loss of accuracy and long -standing up to two kilometers.</p>
<p>In the case of high quality ball bearing, "critical for the production of any type of movable vehicle", 55% of pre-war volumes from Europe and North America came to Russia.</p>

This is probably inhibiting the pace and quality of Russian defense production," is in the report.At the same time, the authors of the report warn that Ukraine and its Western partners are uncommon to expect these problems with supply will quickly stop the fighting.</p>
<p>"Sanctions and export control are not a silver ball that will force the Russia to suppress the war," they said. Russia still retains numerical advantage of Ukraine as it has large reserves.</p>

<p>In order to compensate for the Russian numerical advantage, it is vital that Western countries continue to supply technologically advanced weapons to Ukraine, CSIS emphasizes.</p>

<p>This was announced on Wednesday in Brussels during a joint press conference with the Presidential Republic, Peter Pavel Pavel, NATO Secretary General Yinstoltenberg, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“European and North American allies(NATO)But partnerships were severe economic sanctions against Russia. Undoubtedly, we saw some of the allies of the allies due to the fact that food and grain had to be conquered not through the Blackore but land, the territory of European allies on NATO. But this is not a natable. This was discussed in the European Union and in some European countries, ”he said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stoltenberg"></a>.</p>
<p>He expressed his belief that ways to solve such calls would be found, since Ukraine's support in Europe will remain at a very high -communicate one. When a sovereign and independent European country resists the brutal war on the part of another country, it is moral to support the country to be against aggression.</p>

What we see in Europe and North America, all over the whole, is a great support for Ukraine, the unprecedented level of military, financial and economic assistance. In general, NATO allies provided € 150 million euros of economic assistance for Ukraine, of which about € 65 billion is in military assistance, ”Yens Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>The second factor, he said, is that Ukraine's support corresponds to NATO Allies. If President Putin wins, it will make it more dangerous, send him and other authoritarian leaders of the message that they can achieve what they want with the help of strength.</p>
<p>“Third. I really believe that people care. When Europeans and people all over the whole, in North America and the whole world see my peacekeeping, how women rape women and kidnap children, forcibly take away their forcibans - then they really care about it, ”Jens Stoltenberg added.He noted that the "grain" problem should find its solution, but it is not aware of any lack of will and the readiness of the Allies to continue supporting Ukraine.</p>
<p>As it was reported, since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, NATO and the Alliance provides Ukraine with significant political, financial, humanitarian and military assistance. In this case, the warrior includes modern weapons, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and combat vehicles, air defense, anti -tank means, other military barrier equipment, as well as ammunition. Such assistance allows the Ukrainian to be able to use their own right to self -defense, according to the UN Charter.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said about it in the Eviritelvahorphone "The One News", Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“For them, firstly, it is probably one of the most expensive operations, because a large number of equipment is spent on the non-expending, which, incidentally, was destroyed by the armed. They suffer huge losses there. And these casualties are more than our losses. It's a war and we must be realist. Unfortunately, such a price of our independence, ”the painter said.</p>

<p>As for Bakhmut, the Deputy Minister emphasized, the enemy threw all his forces to take control of the city. “But they throw both weapons and equipment there. It is very important for the people. It seems that this is not only a military point but also a political point, because they also threw all their propaganda into Bakhmut. And, accordingly, in order to restrain them, we also have to concentrate the amount of effort. Indeed, because they cannot lead with foul fights, because they lose in them, they resorted to their proven Syrian tactics and actually erased from the face of the building of the building. In this state, it is difficult to hold positions. In fact, they can not be kept in such aspiration. Indeed, in certain areas there is a slight promotion of the enemy, ” - Razulyamal, but reminded that for eight months the forces of defense have not allowed the enemy to capture Bakhmut.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, he stated on April 19 in the capital of Poland on the occasion of honoring the 80th anniversary of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto.</p>
<p>“The most important lesson in our history is never again!No more racism, never released nationalism, never again barbaric bark <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu"></a>. Never again - this is based on our common Europe. We, who are commemorating here today, are united by belief in our common future and our common values: the validity of international law, the peaceful coexistence of all people in freedom of tadomocracy, ”Steinmeier said.</p>
<p>He emphasized that his illegal attack on a peaceful, democratic neighboring Ukraine, Vladimir Putin ridiculed these values and destroyed the foundations of the European Security Order. The Russian President has violated international law, tossing the principle of inviolability of borders and sets out another's land. This war summarizes the people of Ukraine with pervasive suffering, violence, destruction of Tasmer, emphasized the politician. He noted that residents of Poland and Israel know their own history that for freedom and independence it is necessary to fight them to protect them, to protect democracy.</p>

<p>“Never means that there should be no anti -Ukraine anti -Ukraine criminal war in Europe. Never means again: we stand firmly in Ukraine - together with Poland and other our alliance partners. We have a humanitarian, politically and military - together with Poland, Mikola. Never means that we, liberal democracy, are strong when we act together and united, ”the German President emphasized.</p>
<p>He confessed that it was difficult for him to speak before the Poles on this day and in this month. According to Steinmeier, it is "necessary and at the same time difficult" to come to a locally ghetto, where the Germans committed horrific crimes that he causes a deepest shame.The President named more information from the German community of the Germans in Poland, so that today's citizens of democratic FRNNRNAUD are aware of their responsibility and tasks left by those who survived and those who died.</p>
<p>"For us, the Germans, the responsibility to the face of our history knows no boundaries. This remains our reservation in the present and in the future ...

<p>“Can I remain silent when Russian missiles destroy Ukrainian infrastructure, houses, cultural values and cause high mortality and a decrease in the age of hundreds of thousands of civilians? Can I remain silent when I see Bucha's fate? ”Turksky emphasized the applause of the audience.</p>
<p>In this context, he drew attention to the words of one of the leaders of the uprising of the Uvarshav ghetto Mark Edelman: "The most important is life, and if life is more important, freedom is more important, and often for this freedom we need to give life."</p>

<p>"Such decisions(Import restriction is a car.)They contradict the European Law, because the European Union market operates as one common agrarian market. And crossing the border with Poland is the crossing of the border with all the European Union. Therefore, such decisions are not exactly made at the level of individual laws or countries, they belong to the exclusive comation of the European Commission, "he said.</p>
<p>He stressed that the ban on import and restriction of transit of Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-agroprodukcia"></a>- these are too rigid mechanisms and they must be viewed.</p>

<p>The wife of the President of Ukraine Olena Zelenska reported about it in <a href="https://t.me/FirstLadyOfUkraine/2940?single"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"The Ukrainian pavilion is one of the central locations, and Ukrainian publishers are actively discussing and, more importantly, supported," she said.</p>
<p>As the first lady noted, Ukrainian culture is now in the spotlight of the world, so a significant significant event should be considered as an opportunity to tell about its self -speculation, uniqueness and diversity. "And at the same time as an opportunity to protect it - from the aggressor, which, as the last year testifies, seeks to destroy all the Ukrainian: the Inash of the nation, and our cultural code," Zelensk added.</p>
<p>The exposition of the Ukrainian pavilion at the London fair presents a meter from libraries destroyed by Russian rockets. They are painted in white color. According to Zelenskaya, these furniture as ghosts, as a reminder of the world, however, how much was taken away from Ukrainians by Russia <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu"></a>.</p>

When there are children's books on the ruins of houses - and we do not find their owners."</p>
<p>The first Lady also emphasized that Ukraine is fighting not only for the person to die, but not to be burning, but not to violate international principles, so that military aggression and attack on another country remain on the pages of historical books, not in news tapes.</p>
<p>Separately, Zelenskaya thanked for the fact that it was at the London Fair that Ukrainians found partners for the book "Books without borders" for a year. She stated that this year the cooperation of Ukrainian representatives and the world publishing community will also be fruitful.</p>
<p>"And without borders, in fact, now all Ukrainian culture is so powerful now is spreading the world," the president's wife emphasized.</p>

<p>Experts emphasized during a roundtable: "Pantheon of Heroes: How to Memory of Those who gave life for Ukraine", which took place at the MilitaryMedia Center, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“The rifle community pays for rent for the place of burial of Yevgeny Konovalets. I think it will be when they do not pay this lease for one month, or forget to do it the Foreign Ministry, which is also pushed before it. And what happened to the grave of Alexander Oles: the excavator will arrive, digs the grave of Konovalets, it will be removed on the sidelines, and in this place it can be buried with a conditional judgment(The person who took the guilt for the murder of the Konovalets - ed.)», - said the first deputy chairman of the State Committee for Television and Radio Bogdan Chervak.</p>
<p>He also presented an appeal from Ukrainian nationalists to the President of Zelensky about the founder's reburial <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oun"></a>Yevgeny Konovalets.</p>
<p>“We appeal to the President of Ukraine to initiate measures to reburial Yevgenacon. Yevgeny Konovalets does not belong to any party, group or organization. It belongs to the Ukrainian people, who will certainly take care of his proper honor, ”the document reads.</p>

<p>Пресофіцер 112 бригади ТРО ЗСУ, кандидат політичних наук Андрій Ковальовзазначив, що у процесі збереження пам’яті про осіб, які відстоювалинезалежність України, держава має також опікуватися перенесенням похованьукраїнських героїв із-за кордону.</p>
<p>За його словами, законодавства низки країн, зокрема, Німеччини, Бельгії,Нідерландів, передбачають, що могила існує доти, доки є ті, хто оплачує їїоренду. Без продовження оренди пам’ятник зносять, тіло ексгумують, кісткипереносять до братської могили, а місце знову передають в оренду. Ковальовнаголосив, що активісти своїми силами рятують могили українських героїв, але«вони не можуть підставляти плече вічно».</p>
<p>«Таких могил великих українців тисячі, і Українська держава має їх врятувати.Це другий виклик: зберігаючи могили сучасних героїв російсько-українськоївійни, ми втрачаємо могили та пам’ять про героїв попередніх російсько-українських воєнів», - сказав він.</p>

<p>This was confirmed at the request of the publication <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ukraine-krieg-newsblog-cyberkrieg-iris-t-slm-entwicklungshilfe-1.5807863"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"Germany has put in Ukraine a second state -of -the -art IRIS -T defense system for the protection of Russian attacks," the government's press service said.</p>
<p>There have been no official reports on the site of the federal government or the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>In general <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nimeccina"></a>She promised to convey such systems. The first was staged in October last year and received an assessment of the Ukrainian side, in particular, from the mayor of Kiev Vitaliy Klitschko, who stated that there were no misses in this system and that it saved thousands of years.</p>

<p>Iris-T SLM is produced by a German manufacturer Diehl Defense. Anti -aircraft rocket launchers are affected by targets up to 20 kilometers and up to 40 kilometers.</p>
<p>The problem is that rockets are extremely expensive and scarce, in Kiev, familiar with the course of negotiations, they say that they cost about 600 thousand Euuros each. Controlled missiles can track goals with the help of an integrated infrared GSN and ultimately aim to destroy rocket planes.</p>

<p>In order to provide Ukraine with better aircraft protection, the Seventeenth negotiations are negotiating mobile launches. According to government circles, these devices of the Swedish army could be easily combined with the system, and rocketiris-T could also be started. The Bundesver views the IRIS-T-SLS supplies, but they have a shorter range and are used, for example, in Eurofighter fighters, which are now said to be over 600. ALEDLA will need a Sweden Agreement with the Starting Playgrounds.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Federal Government announced that it had been promised to Ukraine in January of the SRCPATROT.</p>
<p>It was reported that on April 21 on the basis of the US Air Force in Germany Ramstein there was a meeting of the Contact Group for Assistance to Ukraine.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://uacouncil.org/uk/post/27-agrarnih-asociacij-ukraini-zaklikali-es-znati-zaboroni-na-postavki-produkcii"></a>It is noted that "solidarity" paths should work to prevent famine from the outlive countries of Africa and Asia, and therefore a new wave of migration to European countries.</p>
<p>The Association emphasizes that without the full operation of these ways will export the further destruction of the world chains of added value of products, which will cause financial losses to both Ukrainian and foreign producers.</p>
<p>In addition, the introduction of restrictive trade measures by the EUCS countries has many international treaties, including WTO trade rules, EU norms on the Common Market, the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU, and also undermines the postulates of EU Solidarity Introduced.</p>
<p>Var emphasizes that the markets of the EU EU countries have never been key for Ukrainian grain or other agricultural products, given the high level of agricultural production in these countries. Therefore, the circumstances that have developed today are only situational in nature caused by the Russian war of the Ukrainian ports of the Black and Azov Seas.</p>

At the same time, Uzar claim that "the lion's share of products goes transit to other countries, and this is the main interest of the Ukrainian agricultural sector."</p>
<p>"However, the consistency and predictability of trade politics is important, because to a full -scale invasion of Ukraine has established mutually beneficial work with EU countries on trade in agricultural and food products. Suddenly, the sudden prohibition of imports adversely affects the previously established products and agricultural supplies. -The statement.</p>
<p>Ukrainian agrarians call European colleagues to open dialogue with representatives of European institutions to find compromise, which will not contradict EU rules and norms.Ukrainian agrarians ask representatives of the European Commission to assist in the removal of trade restrictions on trade between EU and Ukraine, as well as to develop the development of logistics infrastructure of the EU EU countries.</p>

<p>This was announced on Wednesday in Brussels during a joint press conference with the Presidential Republic, Peter Pavel Pavel, NATO Secretary General Yinstoltenberg, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“European and North American allies(NATO)But partnerships were severe economic sanctions against Russia. Undoubtedly, we saw some of the allies of the allies due to the fact that food and grain had to be conquered not through the Blackore but land, the territory of European allies on NATO. But this is not a natable. This was discussed in the European Union and in some European countries, ”he said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stoltenberg"></a>.</p>
<p>He expressed his belief that ways to solve such calls would be found, since Ukraine's support in Europe will remain at a very high -communicate one. When a sovereign and independent European country resists the brutal war on the part of another country, it is moral to support the country to be against aggression.</p>

What we see in Europe and North America, all over the whole, is a great support for Ukraine, the unprecedented level of military, financial and economic assistance. In general, NATO allies provided € 150 million euros of economic assistance for Ukraine, of which about € 65 billion is in military assistance, ”Yens Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>The second factor, he said, is that Ukraine's support corresponds to NATO Allies. If President Putin wins, it will make it more dangerous, send him and other authoritarian leaders of the message that they can achieve what they want with the help of strength.</p>
<p>“Third. I really believe that people care. When Europeans and people all over the whole, in North America and the whole world see my peacekeeping, how women rape women and kidnap children, forcibly take away their forcibans - then they really care about it, ”Jens Stoltenberg added.He noted that the "grain" problem should find its solution, but it is not aware of any lack of will and the readiness of the Allies to continue supporting Ukraine.</p>
<p>As it was reported, since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, NATO and the Alliance provides Ukraine with significant political, financial, humanitarian and military assistance. In this case, the warrior includes modern weapons, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and combat vehicles, air defense, anti -tank means, other military barrier equipment, as well as ammunition. Such assistance allows the Ukrainian to be able to use their own right to self -defense, according to the UN Charter.</p>

In addition, the Russian Federation is losing up to 150 tanks in Ukraine on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>According to Ukrinform, this is stated in the report of the Center of Strategic and International Research(CSIS), informs <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/19/europe/russia-weapons-production-report-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"></a>.</p>

<p>In particular, Moscow lost up to 3.5 thousand tanks per year of the war, with about 500 units of a modernized T-72B3 tank, first staged by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in 2013.</p>
<p>The T-55 tanks, put into operation in 1948, appear on the battlefield.</p>

But Russia is losing an average of almost 150 tanks of all types in Ukraine on an monthly report.</p>
<p>As for optical systems, Russia relied on French imports.</p>
<p>Through sanctions, it is forced to install old, less perfect sights even their most up -to -date tanks, which leads to loss of accuracy and long -standing up to two kilometers.</p>
<p>In the case of high quality ball bearing, "critical for the production of any type of movable vehicle", 55% of pre-war volumes from Europe and North America came to Russia.</p>

<p>"Sanctions and export control are not a silver ball that will force the Russia to suppress the war," they said. Russia still retains numerical advantage of Ukraine as it has large reserves.</p>

<p>“This is not the first act of aggression and antihumane that we see from Russian Army. Those who have done so can and should be presented before Ukrainian building. According to the Roman Statute, they committed military crimes. Whatever it may sound horrifying, also, according to certain rules, such cases of uncomfortable cases should also be considered by the International Criminal Court, ”the Deputy Minister said.</p>
<p>She noted that this case certainly falls under the definition of "torture" and called on anyone who suffered from such crimes to seek legal assistance.</p>

<p>According to she anyone who watches this video reads such news. Unfortunately, similar renovative things that have to inspire us or destabilize us will be ideal. But keep in mind that the statute of limitations in crimes exists. "</p>

<p>A soldier who serves and protects the country from the aggressor, risking his own life and health, performs tasks in difficult conditions, should be highly motivated. Remember what a coal, Marinka or Avdiivka look like. Each day of Ukraine's defense is given to us at a very high price. The cost of life and healthy defenders, ”the message reads.</p>
<p><strong> Therefore, the additional monetary reward is accrued depending on the districts and the complexity of the tasks performed by fighters. </strong></p>
<p>The General Staff of the Armed Forces noted that <strong> 100 thousand hryvnias </strong> per month, as before, are preserved to defenders who are fighting directly at the front country.</p>
<p><strong> 30 thousand </strong> are paid to the military who perform tasks in the areas of combatants but do not directly participate in the fighting with the enemy, proportional to the time of completion task.</p>
<p>If servicemen are out of the war zone, in the rear, then the sub -tax payments to them <strong> are not accrued </strong>.</p>
<p>At the same time, as of February 1, 2023, all servicemen have been raised by the minimum amount of monetary support to 20100.</p>
<p>"We ask you to stop engaging in populism and concentrate on the defense of our state," - called on the General Staff of the Armed Forces.</p>

<li>
<p>It is important to understand that there will not be such a day when the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be told - tomorrow we begin a counter -offensive. In war, this is secret information. The bricks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which we do not have the right to discuss in the public space - there is annana Malyar, on the air of the Unified Information TV, empire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, it is not necessary to reduce a counter -offensive only to some actively -comprehensive actions. Because it is a strategic goal - to stop the enemy of this offensive actions and to release all our territories. Therefore, to speak in a highlight of a counter -offensive is incorrect, because it is a huge set of actions of and event actions that are currently carrying out the armed forces, - said Anna Malyar. - The formation of certain tactics for plans "A", "B", "B" ... because one can not be more than one option, because the enemy also reacts. It should be understood that such decisions are made in a very short time, not in a month, two or half a year. The plan is chosen so that the enemy does not have time to react to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to her, the Armed Forces do not prepare one thing at this time - in a specific time in any Krette direction. The Armed Forces prepare the whole complex of defense of tutorial measures daily.</p>
<ul>
<li>And, in fact, active assault actions in Bakhmut, Marinka in the Avdiivsky, Liman directions of the front, can also be considered an element of a counter -offensive, - said Anna Malyar.</li>

<p>The Deputy Ministers of Ukraine Anna Malyar told about it on the air of the only news.</p>
<p>She also reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have successfully operated on three -laborers - Avdiivsky, Marinski and Lymansky. Although fierce fighting continues there, the enemy cannot move in these directions.</p>
<ul>
<li>As for Bakhmut, it should be noted that the enemy threw all the forces of the name of this city. The enemy has concentrated here all his professional units, in particular, Wagner, special forces, paratroopers, and weapons and equipment are here. For them, victory here is already important not only the Zavian but also from a political point of view, because all efforts of propaganda they have been caught on Bakhmut. In order to restrain them, we should also concentrate a lot of effort, - said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine also informed that the occupiers are losing the troops in street battles. Therefore, the Russians resorted to their proven Syrian tactics, in fact, erasing from the face of the land of the building and structures of the city. In such a situation, it is very difficult to keep positions. Therefore, in certain areas, unfortunately, there is a slight promotion of the enemy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bakhmut's defense has been going on for eight months, and our armed forces do not allow the enemy to move deep into our territories. For the Russians, this is probably one of the finding operations, because it has already spent a large number of weapons and equipment, the occupiers there bear huge losses there. We have, thanks to the professional work of command and efficient planning, losses are minimal as for such a disposal of fighting. So the destruction of the enemy there is a huge and very important work of our armed forces, - summed up Anna Malyar.</li>

<p>The Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Anna Malyar noted this during the live broadcast of the only news.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's be realists, Russia is a strong enemy. From the point of view of the number of bonds, weapons of the invaders dominated us. We also have our advantages, otherwise they would not last so much. It is the professionalism of our military, it is a motivation, because we wage a just war and protect our land. We have no choice, we have to defend ourselves and it gives us strength.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we are facilitated by help from our partners. But let's build up - the world was not ready for such a protracted and such intense reprimanding weapons of war. Russia has been preparing for this for 30 years, so it is difficult to get out of service. And in Bakhmut, we see how Russian remedies for a powerful offensive. What we are holding back the month, - said Anna Malyar.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine stressed that helping partner is extremely, even critical, important to us. The world begins to understand that we can only drink Russia together. And this must be done, because Russia will not be wrapped on the borders of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we, God forbid, we will not stop them here, they just move on. Therefore, such as a meeting of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in Ramstein format is extremely important not only for us, - said Hannamal.</li>

They agreed on registration renewal and inspection of the court arriving under the loading of Ukrainian grain.</p>
<p>On April 10, Russia has stopped registering a new entrance fleet to participate in a vines and refused to work on the plans of Ukrainian ports. This is made by the assembly of inspection plans and actually stopped the entry of new vessels with the framework of the grain initiative.</p>
<p>It is known that in the last two days, on April 17-18, no inspection was drawn up and no inspection was carried out in Turkey's territorial waters. The 18th Ukrainian side suggested to carry out at least 2 inspections of the output 2 inspection of the entrance fleet. This proposal was also supported by the Turkish Storone, but was not implemented because of Russia's position.</p>
<p>In demanding regulation of the activities of Ukrainian ports by determining the vessels that can participate in the initiative, Russia has violated the official procedure procedure and terms of the grain agreement in particular.</p>
<p>The requirements to control and interfere with the work of Ukrainian ports are unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Turkish Defense Minister Akaru Hulus for a constructive dialogue of the Tacitka position to support the work of the grain initiative. Despite that the inspections of the ships will be renewed, we continue working consultations with the UN Tattoochyna regarding ways to ensure the full fulfillment of the grain agreement to fulfill the obligations of all parties and procedures of the SCC.

<p>According to her, in such a situation, Ukraine, as the state, occupies a very strong position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, this is a legally competent position, because we demand that at several levels court cases of crimes of the Russian Federation be considered. And now we have been a chance to become a locomotive in the world, because since the Nuremberg process, there have been more precedents when international courts were drafting to the crime of aggression, that is, for the war. Military crimes and anti -spectivity crimes are derived from the main crime - aggression, - said Hannamal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine reported that today Ukraine demands the creation of an international special -Tribunal in order for Russia to be punished by aggression. And it may be able to stop the war in the world, but this requires the consolidated political will of the international community. We do everything today to document these crimes.</p>

Thanks to the sanctions, there are many negative processes now that they will overcome in Russia, which will eventually produce their powerful results.</p>
<p>This was announced on the national telephone "Unified News" by the secretary of the radinational security and defense of Ukraine Alexei Danilov.</p>
<p>He noted that it is difficult to destroy the economy of the Russian Federation, given that it is raw materials. However, high technologies are essential for them, spare parts are almost not supplied to the Russian Federation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only country we can say exactly that it is a supplier of arms to Russia is Iran. As soon as any other countries try to supply Russia, and in the modern world it is difficult to hide, the mechanisms for the extradition of sanctions will accurately do these countries more harm than potential ones from cooperation with the aggressor, - Alexei Danilov stressed.</li>

Vin reported that this cemetery would be able to accommodate about 50 thousand departments, not taking into account Columbarium. On May 31, 2022, the Parliament approved, according to which the architectural complex will include its own military vechet, a museum complex, a ritual building and other necessary structures for organizing honorary burials. At the Ministry of Veterans of Ukraine, a separate institution was founded in 2022 - the National Military Memorne Square, which will be taken care of by its creation, and subsequently - will ensure the proper functioning of space.

<li>If we do not appreciate the dead, then we are alive to anything, - the fighter of the battalion named after Sergiy Kulchytsky NSU Bogdanmatkivsky spread his speech. The question of the pantheon, in his opinion, is a question of national consciousness and national security and the fact that today the discussion has already moved from the "need to create" the pantheon to "ways of its creation" - an extremely positive signal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Candidate of Historical Sciences, Representative of the National University of Defense of Ukraine Bogdan Skopenko spoke about the world experience of ordering pantheons, giving examples of ancient Rome, France, Portugal and Venezuela. Many countries have legally established who is entitled to be buried in the pantheon, which time has to pass from the death of a person so that his remains can be transferred to the dotteon and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of our national interests, taking into account our national features, we must take into account the world experience of creating and functioning of pensions, because we do not have such experience yet, - said Bogdan Skpenko.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also expressed the opinion that the national pantheon of heroes and the national -tier memorial cemetery - should be different locations.</p>
<p>Other participants talked about the need for a conceptual approach to the problem of pantheon formation, the need to start such memorials in the region of Ukraine, about the introduction of a visit to the pantheon of prominent figures to programvations of foreign delegations and national-patriotic education of youth. More about this - in the following materials Armyinform.</p>

<p>Наслідки дій рф можуть спостерігати і жителі Болгарії та Туреччини, дефіксується масова загибель дельфінів. Лише в українській частині Чорного морязафіксовано 150 смертей дельфінів. Відомо про 3 види сімейства дельфінів, якізараз перебувають на межі вимирання.</p>
<p>Ще один кричущий факт, який свідчить про масштаби трагедії у сфері захистудовкілля — під загрозою опинилися всі 28 видів кажанів, зареєстрованих вУкраїні та занесених до Червоної книги. Це одна з груп тварин, які дужеболісно реагують на зміни довкілля.</p>
<p>«Своїми діями росія порушує Статут ООН, нехтує резолюціями ГенеральноїАсамблеї, знищує види та середовища проживання рослин і тварин. У тому числі,захищені на міжнародному рівні. Європейський парламент визнав росію державою,яка підтримує тероризм. І ми наполягаємо на тому, щоб участь росії у прийняттірішень на міжнародних майданчиках була обмежена», — зазначив ЄвгенійФедоренко.</p>
