<p>Such a norm is contained in the decision to amend the city target program of construction(acquisition)Available housing for 2021–2030, adopted on June 13 during an extraordinary session of Kharkiv City Council.</p>
<p>In this way, the deputies took care of our military and law enforcement officers who participated in the measures necessary to ensure the defense of Ukraine, protection of the security of the population and the interests of the state in connection with Russian aggression.</p>
<p>In addition, by voting, other changes have been made to this program, and will be able to remain in the queue to receive a preferential lever with the preservation of the order in the Register.</p>
<p>The initiators of these important decisions were a deputy group of numerous protectives of Ukraine, headed by a representative of the Kharkiv Regional Public Organization "Union of ATO Veterans" Yuri Korsunov.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social support for people who win or won victory for all Ukrainians is extremely needed, - says Yuri Korsunov. - There is a lot of such measures. We have long sought to make these changes be made. By the way, we also work on other important issues, including the provision of safety housing of our soldiers and families of dead brothers.</li>
</ul>
<p>He said that on the basis of the last decision of the City Council the mechanism of providing interest -free loans is being worked out, specific housing facilities, state financial institutions and more are selected. Therefore, there is a little more to work on bringing this issue to the finish line. However, in his thought, the hardest thing is behind.</p>
<p>By the way, at the same time in Kharkiv region a regional program for supporting ATO/OOS participants for construction or purchase of housing in the Kharkiv region for 2022-2025 is being implemented. This social project, better known as "60%by 40%", stipulates that the participants of the program from the regional budget compensate for 40%of the cost of the home they buy. The rest of the money is paid by ATO/OOS. Among the criteria for determining the priority of candidates for housing is the multidimensionality, injuries, disability, etc.</p>

<li>Against us were various units - both Rosarmia's battle units and Wagner PVC, and our former compatriots - residents of quasi -Rrespulic, created by a nine years ago. They were often sent to the storms where they became guns in the livel. Many have gone against us on the battlefield of extorting the years of Soviet. I am no longer talking about metal helmets - people without bulletproof vests went on. We killed them, and in their bodies is a spur.

<p>About it <a href="https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2023/06/13/rezultati-zakupivel-produktiv-harchuvannya-zsu-na-druge-pivrichchya-buli-oprilyudneni-v-sistemi-prozorro-12-13-chervnya/">reports</a>Ministry of Defence Ukraine.</p>
<p>At the same time, on June 12, several people spread unreliable and incorrect information on the purchase of food of the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, as for "not publishing information on which, allegedly, the collegial body made a decision on Friday, June 9", then the collegial organ of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Defense Procurement, and by the way, there is a representative of the Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense Ministry , On June 9, he made only a decision to reject participants in some procedures, which MUS immediately published in the electronic system of ProZorro on June 9.</p>
<p>The decision to recognize the winners was transferred by the collegial body to June 12, after which IUU on the same day - June 12 - immediately published them by the ProZorro procurement system. It is about 8 procurement procedures. This information is open. In addition, on June 13, another 8 procedures were announced and winners.</p>
<p>In total, the Ministry of Defense has announced 22 procedures for the purchase of food for the Armed Forces. Currently, 16 of them have results and the winners have been announced. The winners have not yet been determined by 4 processes; Another 2 procedures were rejected by all times, and on June 13, these 2 procedures were repeated.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, people who have distributed information that the publications of trading are not being delayed and not published. These "data" is not true. This is easily checked both in the ProZorro system, so it is idle at the expense of public control - a representative of the anti -correal counterparts is a part of the collegial body of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement. Actually, information about this "fact" has already been deleted by authors from publications. What do we have in reality? Purchases are ongoing, everything happens to all procedures and without violation of no terms, which are defined by the Law on Public Procurement, - said Deputy Minister of Defense Denisssharapov.In addition, during the period of clarifications from the participants for each procedure, a secondary average of 40 appeals - that is, 22 procedures more than 850 appeals. The Ministry of Defense is obliged to publish appropriate explanations within one working day from the date of receipt of the receipt.</p>
<p>“Given that all this could have caused the disruption of the personal composition, the MOU took into account these risks and proposed the corresponding changes to the CMUN335 resolution. Important: These changes did not oblige the MOU to continue the current agreements of the year, but only gave the right to amend the time, sufficient for the procurement procedure. We cannot allow our military to eat. The reaction to such threats is obvious - it is impossible to make a lot of inspection on the nutrition of military unscrupulous participants. Currently, the post -publication of the results of bidding, that is, when we are sure that the auction has taken place, that there will be no disruption of food supplies to our defenders and rags, we have applied to leave these changes without consideration without consideration, ”Denis Sharapov added.</p>

The attacker openly promoted the ideas of mass physical destruction of Ukrainians, as well as the civil infrastructure of our country.</p>
<p>Linguistic and linguistic expertise confirmed the facts of the criminal activity of the Russian citizen Dugin. On the basis of the evidence collected, he was notified to him by two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:</p>
<ul>
<li>encroachment on the territorial integrity and integrity of Ukraine; * genocide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the attacker is hiding from justice in the territory of Russia, SBBA is comprehensive measures to hold him responsibility against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Представник штабу запевнив, що робота зі звільнення прикордонників іЗахисників Зміїного ведеться щоденно:</p>
<p>«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».</p>
<p>Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:</p>
<p>«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».</p>
<p>Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:</p>
<p>«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».</p>
<p>Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.</p>
<p>«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.</p>
<p>Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.</p>

<p>The correspondent of the Armyinform witnessed one of the stages of demining nearby entertainment of the Vyshgorod district, in the Kyiv region.</p>
<ul>
<li>the Russian invaders occupied entertaining on March 15. Before entering the populated point, the Russians inflicted the air strike in the local hospital. As a result of this seven people were injured in varying degrees of gravity, four were killed, including two children, - said Valentina Strazhivsky District Studzhivsky district. - retreating, the invaders were blown up by the bridges. The explosion was such a force that in some houses the roofs were struck, the door and windows were knocked out. The fragments of the bridge and the ammunition laid down by the Russians.</li>
</ul>

One stages of which was the restoration of movement across the River of Zherev, which divides the village of Slazvrav and Zherevpillya. At all stages of the builders are accompanied by changes of variations, including representatives of the State Special Transport Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The State Special Transport Service is a specialized military formation, which is part of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, intended to ensure the sustainable functioning of transport in peacetime and in a special period.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dsst_05.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_05-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

The first time they cleared the territory in the beginning of the construction of the temporary bridge. Now the builders have come to the erection of a new bridge. During the work, they found ammunition that were detonated, and called our group to mine the construction site,-says the commander of the engineering-sapper group of DSST Alexander Prizhikov. - It is very difficult to work in this area, because the soil remains the same concrete elements of the structure of the old bridge, which significantly complicates the use of the ministry.</p>
<p>Of course, the sappers of the State Support Service were not only demining the adjacent destroyed bridge of the territory. The local residents asked the military to inspect the land and other territories near the village, and they were never denied.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dsst_09.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_09-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

The use of so many ammunition can only be explained that the invaders needed to release a place for washing machines that they selected from local residents.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dsst_11.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_11-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

Due to the fact that the detected ammunition cannot be transported, the sappers decided to destroy them on the spot.</p>

<p>"Despite the fact that our headquarters is dealing with the liberation of prisoners of war, we also try to forget from Russian captivity and our civilian citizens, using our exchange fund for this purpose," the Ombudsman's representative is explained.</p>
<p>According to him, the search and liberation of such persons is complicated by the fact that the Russian notes do not confirm the maintenance on their or temporarily occupied territories of civilian citizens, because it is an international crime. Nevertheless, Ukraine has an effort to make an effort to press on Russia at the international level and to require a non -civilian return to the Motherland.</p>
<p>Also, families were interested in hostages of civilians whether they were threatened with criminal responsibility after returning home. The representative of the ex -inspiring was that civilians were not threatened with criminal liability, even if they were forced to receive Russian passports: “We understand that it is often the emphasis on survival. Therefore, of course, such persons will not bear the responsibility for it. ”</p>
<p>At the same time, the expert noted that almost all civilian hostages of the special service offer cooperation in favor of the aggressor state.</p>
<p>According to a coordination representative, after returning home, Ukrainian services carry out a number of inspections of liberated persons. If it is possible that one or the other person has agreed to cooperate with the enemy and already manage to harm our country, such person will be held accountable.</p>

<p>«Розширюємо список країн, з якими лібералізуємо транспортні перевезення.Створення умов для ефективної роботи наших перевізників – одне з ключовихзавдань Міністерства. «Транспортний безвіз» вже діє з Європейським Союзом, уберезні його було продовжено до червня 2024 року. Ми не зупиняємось, триваютьвідповідні перемовини з іншими країнами», - зазначив заступник міністрарозвитку громад, територій та інфраструктури Сергій Деркач.</p>
<p>Також Україна та Північна Македонія домовилися вдвічі збільшити квоту дозволівдля виконання перевезень до третіх країн на нинішній та наступний рік, а такожузгодили порядок їх дії. Вони можуть бути використані як в прямому, так і узворотному напрямку. Такий вид дозволів дійсний для транспортних засобів будь-якої категорії екологічності.</p>
<p>Щоб скористатися «транспортним безвізом», у перевізників має бути сертифікатвиробника або уповноваженої установи для підтвердження класу екологічності неменше Євро-3.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://newatlas.com/space/worlds-first-space-factory-varda/">New Atlas</a>.</p>
<p>According to representatives of Varda Space Industries, such production is very useful for growing protein crystals. Since gravity is not influencing the properties of chemical compounds in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kosmos">space</a>, the production of medicines in extraterrestrial conditions can make a revolution in this industry.</p>
<p>Particularly important is the possibility for manufacturers of medicines that can use a space plant with weightlessness for crystallization of biological proteins in order to analyze their structure and create medicines.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T17-27-00-03-00/1686860720-419.jpg" />Such a space plant can also be used for the production of medicines with extraordinary precision. And such production costs a lot less than on Earth. Due to the fact that the cost of launch into space becomes less costly, such production can be success.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T17-27-00-03-00/1686860720-409.jpg" />So far, Varda Space Industries was the first to send to the space production and at the same time a laboratory satellite. It will fly in orbit for more than a month at an approximate height of 1000 km. The plant launched Falcon 9 on June 12. After the mission is completed, the device will return to the ground.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T17-27-00-03-00/1686860719-302.jpg" />Varda believes that their new development can also be used to carry out various research in the field of hypersonic.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T17-27-00-03-00/1686860719-998.jpg" />If everything goes by, Varda Space Industries plans to send a similar device to space at the end of this year. The American company has plans to create multiple production space modules and even has a plan to create a production space station in the orbit of the Earth.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://newatlas.com/space/worlds-first-space-factory-varda/">New Atlas</a>.</p>
<p>According to representatives of Varda Space Industries, such production is very useful for growing protein crystals. Since gravity is not influencing the properties of chemical compounds in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kosmos">space</a>, the production of medicines in extraterrestrial conditions can make a revolution in this industry.</p>
<p>Particularly important is the possibility for manufacturers of medicines that can use a space plant with weightlessness for crystallization of biological proteins in order to analyze their structure and create medicines.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T23-27-00-03-00/1686860720-419.jpg" />Such a space plant can also be used for the production of medicines with extraordinary precision. And such production costs a lot less than on Earth. Due to the fact that the cost of launch into space becomes less costly, such production can be success.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T23-27-00-03-00/1686860720-409.jpg" />So far, Varda Space Industries was the first to send to the space production and at the same time a laboratory satellite. It will fly in orbit for more than a month at an approximate height of 1000 km. The plant launched Falcon 9 on June 12. After the mission is completed, the device will return to the ground.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T23-27-00-03-00/1686860719-302.jpg" />Varda believes that their new development can also be used to carry out various research in the field of hypersonic.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-15T23-27-00-03-00/1686860719-998.jpg" />If everything goes by, Varda Space Industries plans to send a similar device to space at the end of this year. The American company has plans to create multiple production space modules and even has a plan to create a production space station in the orbit of the Earth.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T38-00-00-04-00/propaganda-1.jpg" />During a briefing of representatives of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine in Military Mediacenter, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said that the Ministry of Defense monitors how the enemy fights against Ukraine in the information field, and in real examples, unto the two main theses that are trying to give up Russian propaganda:</p>
<p>“Now the Russians are spreading two main theses. The first is about the allegedly large losses of the personal staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Such information is aimed at demoralizing the Ukrainian army from one way, and on the other, on the contrary, to raise a spiritual army. Therefore, in this situation, it can be noted that, first, during the war, the same of the parties does not publish accurate data of its losses, because the enemy is nigger and can adjust its plans, including to assume and calculate our plans. Now we can talk only about the ratio, which at the beginning of the 2014 and a large -scale invasion of 2022, brief: the number of dead on the Ukrainian side is much or much or more than times lower than the loss of the enemy. Yesterday we published these figures. If we talk about last week, in the area of operational responsibility of the operative-strategic groups of the Khortytsia troops, enemies were killed almost more times more than our servicemen. Speaking of the pronounced direction, the enemies were killed 5.3 times more than the Ukrainian people. The life of our warriors is the most valuable for us and is a priority in the time of planning military operations.</p>
<p>The second narrative, spread by the Russians to discredit military aid, refers to Bradley armored vehicles that partners provide us. " During the time briefing, Anna Malyar demonstrated a photo of Bradley BMP(M2 Bradley), in which the shell of the RSZV "Grad" was combined. In the first photo - the machine immediately after the direct number, on the second - a crew, which was successfully evacuated and continues to fulfill the tasks on other technique.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Russian occupation troops took the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric power plant under February 26, 2022, - recalled Ruslan Beregul. - Manipulations of water with water in the Kakhovka reservoir began in October after the occupation of the Right Bank of the Kherson region in order to influence the defense force at the mouth of the Dnieper, as well as the injection of the situation on nuclear security at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.</li>
</ul>
<p>On May 21, 2023, two weeks before the undermining of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, the Russians were drawn to drain the Kakhovka reservoir and increased the volume of water in it is 17.6 meters in it.</p>
<p>In addition, the Head of the Department of Environmental Safety and Mine Activities, that on October 20 last year, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky reported about the replacement of the Russians of the dams and units of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station and the fact that the occupiers plan to carry out a terrorist act under a foreign flag.</p>
<ul>
<li>International observation mission to Kakhovsk hydroelectric power station is needed. It is necessary to return the Ukrainian staff and to provide immediate and professional demining of aggregates and dams. Russia does this to arrange another operation with a front flag - to carry out a terrorist attack and accuse Ukraine. But we know what is true. We know that the territory is controlled by the occupiers and that they were already capable. They themselves will not stop. But we can stop them. We can stop the onset of catastrophic consequences. We can, and therefore - should!- <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/rosijskij-teror-maye-prograti-ukrayina-j-usya-yevropa-mayut-78613?fbclid=IwAR1vPzj-tisioqd-ddMfq0PjP0_u-Z6rn4Od4NV-4KgOCbTaSDb3SidwSi0">said</a>Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address to the European Council.</li>

And before May 4 this year, no one was sure that the Patriotna complex was capable.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Patriot training training is conducted in the regimen by different types of baptist missiles, which are in service with the countries of the aggressor. But even during the simulation of the air situation, the results were not 100 percent. Our subdivision, the first calculations that less than three months studied, were able to destroy the X-47 hypersonic missile, which Putin was attributed to the category of "Analognit". Frankly, I myself realized that we were knocking down the "dagger" only after the study of the debris with expert analysts. And already on May 16, it was clear that it is definitely not a chance. Almost simultaneously, from different directions, there were16 ballistic goals, most of them are aimed at the Patriot complex. I always write down my subordinates, but this time I was shocked by their endurance. People realized that ballistic missiles were moving directly on them. They were not planted for a second, acted harmoniously and organized, distributed whole sectors, ensured their destruction at a minimum range, sufficiently high to reduce the likelihood of infrastructure damage. I was in contact with the division commander and understood what a serious professional and moral testing. After the report: "Air space is pure, all goals were destroyed" —Mebration no one restrained ... Later we learned that there were 6 "daggers" among these purposes. I think the same emotions as we have had partner countries. You do not come up with the best advertising for manufacturers, their complex has realized themselves with a complete measure, proved that he was able to destroy the goals that the Russians positioned impossible for beating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The anti -aircraft has a tradition of marked on the complexes destroyed goals. However, Colonelmanko says that the dagger stencil has not yet been made, although in total Patriotz has already destroyed more than 80 air purposes for a month.</p>

<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Report for this day. The first is that we have significant international steps that intensify our position in several directions.</p>
<p>The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution to support the European Taiuro -Atlantic aspirations of our people. There is a specific call for a leadership euro union to define a clear way of acquiring our state membership in the EU.</p>
<p>And in the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament captures the meaning of our Ukrainian universal in Euro -Atlantic security, which stipulates that the path of Ukraine in NATO is a state -of -the -art invitation to entry in the context of the preparation for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius. Time for integration and security is obvious, and I thank you for the actual statement of this to all members of the European Parliament and Ms. President of the European Parliament Roberti Metzoli, as well as the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for his constant irregular work with the parliament.</p>
<p>The second significant international step for today is the bill on confiscation and transfer of our country as a reparation assets of the Russian state-a terrorist state. I thank the US senators who have a biparty support for this issue for justice for Ukraine's Tavi victims of Russian terror.</p>
<p>In dictatorships such as Russian, money is the highest value. And even more of persons who serve the management regime or are actually owners of state structures.Today he continued to appeal to the parliaments of our partners.</p>
<p>He called on the parliamentarians and the people of Switzerland and continue to maintain the unity of tasolidarity with us in protecting common values and freedom. It is very important that all in Europe we understand equally: only the power of weapons can now protect the life of the life that we all appreciate, in all countries - from the Atlantic of Durane, including Switzerland. This is our common task - to protect freedom, international law and human life.</p>
<p>He also spent telephone conversations with representatives of the two countries-Belize and Costa Rica. We build new partnerships for Ukraine-to support the formula of peace and our resolution in the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law as a whole. The discussion of Mr. Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister Belize is the opportunity to organize a meeting of Ukraine-Latin America. We can together give much more protection for freedom and equality of nations in the modern world.</p>
<p>An important report was today on the situation in Kherson region and in general, half -day countries, in our Dnieper after the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Elimination of the consequences of catastrophe, assistance to people, providing drinking and all other sensitive and important issues. Government Schmigal, Klimenko Minister of Internal Affairs, Profile Deputy Head of the Kuleb Office, representatives of local authorities. Another report is the situation in Kryvyi Rih Taodes after recent strikes of terrorists.</p>
<p>And, of course, the front. I thank all our soldiers, every unit, every boost brigade for today - for today's fighting.</p>
<p>I will note especially six units. Khortytsia dawn-paratroopers of our powerful 80th separate Brigade of DShV.

<p>Ukraine should stand in the position of rejection of any nuclear blackmail. This <a href="https://www.facebook.com/danilov.oleksiy/posts/pfbid0CnPRp4XEt3t9UVaNdzSxpZxye8WfPqi48Cn2P6SdnjmrhdYrwzFjfVcWee3vGVdLl">emphasized</a>Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexey Danilov.</p>
<p>He noted the increased mention of the threat of nuclear war and called the "manipulative" formulation of the question of the threat of Putin's use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“The thesis that, in my opinion, will now actively move to the Kremlin(Yunovorskaya key to the fundamental Western Phobias)that the presence of a nuclear bomb should automatically exclude the resistance of a country that has no such weapons. The country is the object of an attack of a nuclear state, if you go proposed by logic, provokes the threat of nuclear apocalypse. And in such a sequence the object of condemnation becomes not the aggressor, but the victim</p>
<p>We want to tell us: give up and do not resist? We do not need your freedom, we need our comfort and safety? This opinion will be tried to form in the world to refuse to support Ukraine, which by its actions, it turns out, "provokes" Russia ", - said Alexei Danilov.</p>
<p>According to the NSDC Secretary, in order for this false and deceptive logic not to become, we must not tired firmly and consistently in the position of not receiving any nuclear blackmail.</p>
<p>"We are not afraid of the so -called" second army of the world "nor the first in size of existing Russia, nor Putin's bunker rats and his nuclear bunk. Let us only be one - to lose freedom and in the struggle for it we will go to the end, ”he added.</p>
<p>The problem of the Kremlin's nuclear madness, Oleksiy Danilov, is a non -violent exclusively Ukraine, it is the problem of the world.</p>
<p>“The world has long watched and if it did not knowingly help, then it did not interfere with the growth of the Russian monster. It was when Ukraine was forced to pass the second largest arsenal to the Russian nuclear arsenal, to equip the Russian Army Army with our winged rockets, when the world was a donor of modern technologies, a buyer of oil and gas, which became the basis for the financing of construction. When the international elites were corrupted and the Russian oligarchy was opened.</p>

<li>That is, now the main problem in quantity, which is determined on the basis of the translation of important state objects that need cover.

At the same time, there are no problems with the integration of complexes into the overall air defense system of Ukraine in general.

In the middle of June, he came to the Military Medical Officer, located in the Narobozhanshchyna to pass the Military Medical Commission.</p>
<p>He chose the time of visit himself, based on his official employment and state of health, with the help of special software "E-Merga".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T94-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-2-vidviduvach-volodymyr-scaled.jpg" />Visitor of the NMCC PNR Soldier's Lordimir</p>
<ul>
<li>In the medical service of our military unit, I was helped to register for a date convenient for me, - says the defender of Ukraine. -It so happened that during 2022-2023. For the second time, I have to pass the VLK in this hospital. So I have to compare. I have to say that E-Brga is modern, quickly and effectively. I will not say that the queues near certain offices in the clinic have completely disappeared, but there was definitely more.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the command of the military-medical institution, the first version of the e-n-monk was introduced in February 2023.</p>
<p>-Four months ago, we used our own technological development to record and pass the Military Medical Commission,-explains the head of the departmental medical staff. - The results were quite significant then. In May, we will establish a better version of "E-Berg". I note that we have successfully implemented other technological innovations, namely: MIS MISTS SMART, specialized ER Hospital software, Tracker software and others.</p>
<p>By the way, from the beginning of a large-scale invasion of occupiers in this medical facility has increased the number of visitors among the defenders and defenders of Ukraine. Of course, the burden on all doctors increased proportionally, working with visitors in the clinic.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harkiv-gospital-5-scaled.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T94-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-5-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harkiv-gospital-6.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T94-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-6-150x150.jpg" /></a>The temporary executor of the chief of the clinic explained that through professional features, queues sometimes occur near the offices of such doctors as: neuropathologist, traumatologist or psychiatrist.She added that quite often they come to them boys and girls of the spare registration in the E-Brga system. For various reasons, some units of units do not yet enjoy the possibilities of innovation. Therefore, the warriors are divided by the corresponding paper documents for the VLK.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T94-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-1-scaled.jpg" />-Of course, we do not refuse to anyone and accept everyone without records in "E-Berg". However, it should be understood that in such cases there is some correction of schedules of visiting doctors. There is another point here. Yes, if one is a well -deserved person after injury on crutches comes to us, then we somehow go to help her. But what do we do when such soldiers in one day do not get one or two? As a practitioner, E-Merga is a very efficiency in terms of the VLK. I believe that everything will gradually work out and all the employees will send people to us only after electronic registration, - said the military doctor.</p>
<p>According to this military medical institution, they do not hide problematic questions and are constantly working on their solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the event of any difficulty in passing the VLK or on other questions, anyone can call in working hours at number(099)7692113.This is the hotline of our medical institution. Everyone is listened to and locked the call. Finally, I ask our visitors instead of unreasonable criticism of doctors in shoulder straps, first to understand the causes of the problem of thadiz to be tieddiz to our medical and diagnostic capabilities,-assured the head of the medical institution of the defense department.</li>

<li>It is no secret that a rather powerful grouping of a prototype defense was created in the Kyiv region. However, even it cannot one hundred percent guarantee the cover of the sky. We are incredibly grateful to the Western partners of Nasams, Iris-T, and we couldn't dream about Patrioot a year ago. Here, for such a state as Ukraine, this amount is not enough. So, in the first place, the skills of the anti -aircraftmen, which almost never work template. The experience we gained during the year of the war, allows you to respond in a timely manner, bring up missiles, recharge, change positions. You see that no one in Kiev has achieved its success during May. I always say "thank" to the whole team after every destroyed purpose.</li>

<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>Report for this day. The first is that we have significant international steps that enhance our position in several directions.</p>
<p>The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution to support the European Taiuro -Atlantic aspirations of our people. There is a specific call for a leadership euro union to define a clear way of acquiring our state membership in the EU.</p>
<p>And in the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament captures the meaning of our Ukrainian universal in Euro -Atlantic security, which stipulates that the path of Ukraine in NATO is a state -of -the -art invitation to entry in the context of the preparation for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius. Time for integration and security is obviously came, and I thank you for the actual statement of this to all members of the European Parliament and Ms. President of the European Parliament Roberti Metzoli, as well as the head of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for constant irregular work with the parliament.</p>
<p>The second important international step for today is the bill on confiscation and transfer of our state as a reparation of the Russian state-the terrorist state. I thank the US senators who have a biparty support for this issue for justice for Ukraine's Tavi victims of Russian terror.</p>
<p>In dictatorships such as Russian, money is the highest value. And even more of persons who serve the management regime or are actually owners of state structures.</p>
<p>When the state-terrorist and all Russian persons whose labeling with the Kremlin loses its money with the Kremlin created the conditions for Russian aggression or which are an inviocean cover for Russian corrupt officials, then a very important goal will be achieved-they will feel what loss is. They do not respect life and are nothable when human lives are lost. The Russian dominant class does not appreciate the people and is ready to spend human lives for hundreds of thousands. But they regret the money - those who have appropriated by the way. They value their assets. They should be lost, and in favor of those who suffered from their aggression, from this terrorist war in favor of our country, our people.</p>
<p>Today he continued to appeal to the parliaments of our partners.He also spent telephone conversations with representatives of the two countries-Belize and Costa Rica. We build new partnerships for Ukraine-to support the formula of peace and our resolution in the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law as a whole. The discussion of Mr. Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister Belize is the opportunity to organize a meeting of Ukraine-Latin America. We can together give much more protection for freedom and equality of nations in the modern world.</p>
<p>An important report was today on the situation in Kherson region and in general, half -day countries, in our Dnieper after the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Elimination of the consequences of catastrophe, assistance to people, providing drinking and all other sensitive and important issues. Government Schmigal, Klimenko Minister of Internal Affairs, Profile Deputy Head of the Kuleb Office, representatives of local authorities. Another report is the situation in Kryvyi Rih Taodes after recent strikes of terrorists.</p>
<p>And, of course, the front. I thank all our soldiers, every unit, every boost brigade for today - for today's fighting.</p>
<p>I will note especially six units. The Khortytsia fell-paratroopers of our powerful 80th Separate Brigade of DShV. "Tavriya"-warriors of our 23rd separate mechanized brigade, Marines of the 35th and 37th separate brigades, warriors of the 128th-equally mountain-assault Transcarpathian brigade and the 128th separate brigade of Silro ... !For strength, courage, but that you return to Ukraine the Ukrainian land and strengthen our Ukrainian will.</p>
<p>Glory to everyone and everyone who is now in battle, at combat posts and at combat operations!Glory to all who train our warriors!Who treats and rehabilitates defects and defenders after injuries!</p>
<p>Thank you all in the world who helps. And, by the way, the next "Ramstein" today has been quite effective. We are still strong!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>Mr Austin also assured that partners will provide Ukraine with this stage of assistance, but also one that the state will need a long run so that Ukraine can protect itself from further possible aggression by Russia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, it is becoming more clear that Ukraine needs strength that is compatible knowing(Western)Armed forces, ”Austin said.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, as he explained, it is about plans to prepare the military. In his opinion, this will establish the foundations of future cooperations and the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The head of the US defense agency also mentioned the announced new package of the United States worth more than $ 2 billion, which includes additional tubes for Patriot and HAWK systems, missiles, 105- and 203 mm.

<p>He thanked all the participants in the Ramstein format for their support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>But once again he said that Russian President Putin, when starting his great war on Ukraine more than a year ago, thought he would easily win - he was wrong.<strong> Fighters for Ukraine </strong></p>
<p>The closure of the Ukrainian sky, in particular, the need to provide Ukraine with fighter generation was not for the first time voiced by the Ukrainian side, and the universities concentrated their efforts on strengthening the air defense systems for Ukraine, stating that giving fighters it is a long -term process.</p>
<p>However, today at the 13th meeting of the Contact Group on Assistance to Ukraine, Ramstein, Brussels, except the closure of the Ukrainian sky with the help of the Ukrainian air defense(Pentagon's head noted that strengthening the Ukrainian PPO is necessary for the protection of the civilian population and the critical infrastructure)Ukraine also received assurances from partners to start pilot training on modern fighters.  <img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T98-00-00-04-00/fyqk9fmxsaepeen-2.jpg" />According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov after the meeting, he also wandered about the clear intention of the Allies to build a "fighter coalition".</p>
<ul>
<li>Today I have heard very important news about the so -called "bird coalition" or "fighter coalition" ... Today we have obliged from our partners that the training will begin and that we will build the construction of this consorty together together, - Alexei Reznikov said during A common approach to the press by NATO by Jens Stoltenberg.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Minister of Defense, the Ukrainians will first begin training exercises of F-16 led by the Netherlands and Denmark. And then othericraines join.</p>
<ul>
<li>We also heard good news from our Swedish partners that he will be able to test, just test their opportunities, - Alexeyreznikov said, adding that "I am absolutely sure that we will have a" bird coalition "for the Armed Forces."</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier it became known that Ukrainians will go to study at the F-16. The pilots were selected, they had a number of requirements. The Ministry of Defense also named the required F-16 for Ukraine, in particular, Ukraine hopes to receive from the Winning partners about 40-50 F-16 fighters and form three or four-levels for protecting the sky.</p>
<p>Recall that a few weeks ago, US President Joe Biden gave good to training Ukrainian pilots to work at the F-16, and the subsequent transfer of these fighters to the Ukrainian side. The United States was categorically opposed to conversations about modern -year -olds for the Armed Forces. Also, the other day Alexei Reznikov reported that it is possible to receive from the Allies not F-16, but fighters of another type.“Today, my colleagues Luxembourg François Bausha and Estonia Minister Khan Hannovurus have supported my idea of creating an IT Coalition of Ramstin. They are ready to take the leadership role in creating this group, ”he wrote.</p>
<p><strong> Austin commented on the Russian statements about the Russian Allied Ukrainian Technology </strong></p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin during a meeting of the Ramstein contact group stated that the Russians show the same tuning equipment from different angles.</p>
<p>The head of the Pentagon noted that damage to military equipment on the field is fighting, but the Russian side is distributing photos and videos, depicting "those self -apple cars almost a thousand times from ten different angles."</p>
<p>“As for the loss of technique: this is war. Yes, we know that the damage of Napoli battle will be on both sides. But it is important that Ukrainians have the opportunity to display damaged equipment, to repair where possible, and return this technique to the battle. And also that they have means to continue to move forward, ”Austin said at a briefing after meeting the contact group from Ukraine's defense in Brussels.</p>
<p>He stressed that the damage to military equipment will continue, but "if not, Ukrainians still have many combat capabilities." Lloyd Austin also asserted that, as expected, it was a "difficult battle", but he believes in the victory of Ukraine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T98-00-00-04-00/230615a-007_rdax_775x440s.jpg" /><strong> Ukraine is able to liberate its territories </strong></p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Ramstein Meeting Pressing Form, said that NATO representatives have decided today "how to protect and strengthen Ukraine's support. After all, Ukraine has become a counter -offensive assistance to NATO countries is important for success in the battlefield.</p>
<ul>
