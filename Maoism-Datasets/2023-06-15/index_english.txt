 The procedure of procurement of food for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is open and compliance with all procedures. Anyone can track it on the website.
About it reports Ministry of Defence Ukraine.
At the same time, on June 12, several people spread unreliable and incorrect information on the purchase of food of the Ministry of Defense.
Therefore, as for "not publishing information on which, allegedly, the collegial body made a decision on Friday, June 9", then the collegial organ of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Defense Procurement, and by the way, there is a representative of the Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense Ministry , On June 9, he made only a decision to reject participants in some procedures, which MUS immediately published in the electronic system of ProZorro on June 9.
The decision to recognize the winners was transferred by the collegial body to June 12, after which IUU on the same day - June 12 - immediately published them by the ProZorro procurement system. It is about 8 procurement procedures. This information is open. In addition, on June 13, another 8 procedures were announced and winners.
In total, the Ministry of Defense has announced 22 procedures for the purchase of food for the Armed Forces. Currently, 16 of them have results and the winners have been announced. The winners have not yet been determined by 4 processes; Another 2 procedures were rejected by all times, and on June 13, these 2 procedures were repeated.
“Unfortunately, people who have distributed information that the publications of trading are not being delayed and not published. These "data" is not true. This is easily checked both in the ProZorro system, so it is idle at the expense of public control - a representative of the anti -correal counterparts is a part of the collegial body of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement. Actually, information about this "fact" has already been deleted by authors from publications. What do we have in reality? Purchases are ongoing, everything happens to all procedures and without violation of no terms, which are defined by the Law on Public Procurement, - said Deputy Minister of Defense Denisssharapov.In addition, during the period of clarifications from the participants for each procedure, a secondary average of 40 appeals - that is, 22 procedures more than 850 appeals. The Ministry of Defense is obliged to publish appropriate explanations within one working day from the date of receipt of the receipt.
“Given that all this could have caused the disruption of the personal composition, the MOU took into account these risks and proposed the corresponding changes to the CMUN335 resolution. Important: These changes did not oblige the MOU to continue the current agreements of the year, but only gave the right to amend the time, sufficient for the procurement procedure. We cannot allow our military to eat. The reaction to such threats is obvious - it is impossible to make a lot of inspection on the nutrition of military unscrupulous participants. Currently, the post -publication of the results of bidding, that is, when we are sure that the auction has taken place, that there will be no disruption of food supplies to our defenders and rags, we have applied to leave these changes without consideration without consideration, ”Denis Sharapov added.

According to Anna Malyar, Russian invaders were selected and immediately destroyed Ukrainian passports, birth certificates and other documents obtained in Ukraine. The invaders also stole the personal property of citizens with abandoned owners of premises.
“At the same time, representatives of Russian occupation administrations during the removal of propaganda videos by the so -called journalists cynically declared a successful organized evacuation of the civilian population, although practical measures were not taken.

 On the initiative of the NGO "On those whom they are silent", an online meeting with the families of the defenders of Ostrovasmina was held.
About it reports Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.
Representatives of the coordination headquarters, the Office of the Verkhovna Rada for Human Rights, the State Border Guard Service of the Tamzhizh International Committee of the Red Cross were answered by the loved ones.(ICCH).
Представник штабу запевнив, що робота зі звільнення прикордонників іЗахисників Зміїного ведеться щоденно:
«Це показав обмін 11 червня. Ми завжди працюємо, щоби визволити всіх. У наснема улюблених підрозділів чи неулюблених. Тим більше, усі наші Оборонці вколоніях уже перемішані й ворог за великим рахунком теж не ділить їх запідрозділами».
Також він зауважив, що планова робота зі звільнення вдається не завжди:
«Так, краще би був план — кожна мати знала б, коли повернуть її сина і скількитреба чекати. Була б визначеність. Але росіянам байдуже. Хочуть завдати ріднимякомога більше болю. Це їхня політика. Тому кожен обмін — не схожий напопередній. Проте коли відбуваються контрнаступальні операції — обміничастішають».
Представниці Міжнародного комітету Червоного Хреста наголосили, що неприпиняють роботу для відвідин наших бранців:
«Колеги з МКЧХ, які працюють у рф, постійно намагаються переконати російськусторону надати доступ до полонених і підтвердити полон тих, кого утримуютьросіяни і про кого немає інформації. На жаль, це забирає час. Але результатимаємо».
Представник Офісу Уповноваженого Верховної Ради з прав людини застеріг відпропозицій невідомих осіб «викупити з полону» родичів.
«У більшості випадків це шахрайство. Просто заберуть гроші. Також такіпропозиції мають посіяти недовіру до органів нашої державної влади. Крім того,ті, хто ризикне погодитися, можуть потрапити на гачок російських спецслужб», —сказав він.
Координаційний штаб радить повідомляти про такі випадки за контактнимителефонами та звертатися до правоохоронних структур.

 Step by step demining the State Special Defense Transport Service of Ukraine cleans their native land from artillery shells, various mines, aviation and other explosive "gifts" left by Russian invaders during retreat.
The correspondent of the Armyinform witnessed one of the stages of demining nearby entertainment of the Vyshgorod district, in the Kyiv region.

 After the de -occupation, the process of restoring the destroyed infrastructure began. One stages of which was the restoration of movement across the River of Zherev, which divides the village of Slazvrav and Zherevpillya. At all stages of the builders are accompanied by changes of variations, including representatives of the State Special Transport Service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
The State Special Transport Service is a specialized military formation, which is part of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, intended to ensure the sustainable functioning of transport in peacetime and in a special period.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_05-150x150.jpg) 
 
 - We are not working on this facility for the first time. The first time they cleared the territory in the beginning of the construction of the temporary bridge. Now the builders have come to the erection of a new bridge. During the work, they found ammunition that were detonated, and called our group to mine the construction site,-says the commander of the engineering-sapper group of DSST Alexander Prizhikov. - It is very difficult to work in this area, because the soil remains the same concrete elements of the structure of the old bridge, which significantly complicates the use of the ministry.
Of course, the sappers of the State Support Service were not only demining the adjacent destroyed bridge of the territory. The local residents asked the military to inspect the land and other territories near the village, and they were never denied.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_09-150x150.jpg) 
 The sappers argue that the land around the bridge hides many "orkivski-surprises", because during the blasting of the structure, the Russians used an unsecuted amount of ammunition, namely, anti-tank mines TM-62 and 82-mmminometric mines. The use of so many ammunition can only be explained that the invaders needed to release a place for washing machines that they selected from local residents.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-14T83-00-00-04-00/dsst_11-150x150.jpg) 
 
 In total, 22 explosive objects were identified and disposed of this time, including three anti-tank mines of TM-62 and nineteen mortar mines. Due to the fact that the detected ammunition cannot be transported, the sappers decided to destroy them on the spot.

About this it is referred on the site of the German government.
"For the first time in the history of our country, we have developed a national security strategy," Germany's Federal Chancellor Olaf Soltz.
According to him, this strategy is an important contribution to the safety of people in Germany.
"Without security, there is neither freedom nor stability, nor prosperity," - said the German Chancellor.
Olaf Scholtz added that the country's political environment has changed in the last one and a half years, in particular, it meant a large -scale invasion of Russia and attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

The strategy is based on three "central dimensions" of security policy: defense, stability and stability. It states that "today's Russia is the greatest threat to peace and security in the Euro -Atlantic region.

 During the coordination headquarters and the Ombudsman's office, civilians who are hostage to the aggressor state and the Ombudsman's office were not considered to be considered to be consistent with international law. International humanitarian law implies the unconditional perpetrator of such persons. However, the terrorist state despises any international mining and holds civilians near prisoners of war.
About it reports Coordinating headquarters of inquiries for the treatment of prisoners of war.
"Despite the fact that our headquarters is dealing with the liberation of prisoners of war, we also try to forget from Russian captivity and our civilian citizens, using our exchange fund for this purpose," the Ombudsman's representative is explained.
According to him, the search and liberation of such persons is complicated by the fact that the Russian notes do not confirm the maintenance on their or temporarily occupied territories of civilian citizens, because it is an international crime. Nevertheless, Ukraine has an effort to make an effort to press on Russia at the international level and to require a non -civilian return to the Motherland.
Also, families were interested in hostages of civilians whether they were threatened with criminal responsibility after returning home. The representative of the ex -inspiring was that civilians were not threatened with criminal liability, even if they were forced to receive Russian passports: “We understand that it is often the emphasis on survival. Therefore, of course, such persons will not bear the responsibility for it. ”
At the same time, the expert noted that almost all civilian hostages of the special service offer cooperation in favor of the aggressor state.
According to a coordination representative, after returning home, Ukrainian services carry out a number of inspections of liberated persons. If it is possible that one or the other person has agreed to cooperate with the enemy and already manage to harm our country, such person will be held accountable.

 The new companion from Varda Space Industries on June 13 began its work. It is the world's first cosmic pharmaceutical plant that can also be used for hypersonic research.
As Ukrinform reports, it reports New Atlas .
According to representatives of Varda Space Industries, such production is very useful for growing protein crystals. Since gravity is not influencing the properties of chemical compounds in space , the production of medicines in extraterrestrial conditions can make a revolution in this industry.
Particularly important is the possibility for manufacturers of medicines that can use a space plant with weightlessness for crystallization of biological proteins in order to analyze their structure and create medicines.
Such a space plant can also be used for the production of medicines with extraordinary precision. And such production costs a lot less than on Earth. Due to the fact that the cost of launch into space becomes less costly, such production can be success.
So far, Varda Space Industries was the first to send to the space production and at the same time a laboratory satellite. It will fly in orbit for more than a month at an approximate height of 1000 km. The plant launched Falcon 9 on June 12. After the mission is completed, the device will return to the ground.
Varda believes that their new development can also be used to carry out various research in the field of hypersonic.
If everything goes by, Varda Space Industries plans to send a similar device to space at the end of this year. The American company has plans to create multiple production space modules and even has a plan to create a production space station in the orbit of the Earth.

Particularly important is the possibility for manufacturers of medicines that can use a space plant with weightlessness for crystallization of biological proteins in order to analyze their structure and create medicines.
Such a space plant can also be used for the production of medicines with extraordinary precision. And such production costs a lot less than on Earth. Due to the fact that the cost of launch into space becomes less costly, such production can be success.
So far, Varda Space Industries was the first to send to the space production and at the same time a laboratory satellite. It will fly in orbit for more than a month at an approximate height of 1000 km. The plant launched Falcon 9 on June 12. After the mission is completed, the device will return to the ground.
Varda believes that their new development can also be used to carry out various research in the field of hypersonic.
If everything goes by, Varda Space Industries plans to send a similar device to space at the end of this year. The American company has plans to create multiple production space modules and even has a plan to create a production space station in the orbit of the Earth.

 During a briefing of representatives of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine in Military Mediacenter, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said that the Ministry of Defense monitors how the enemy fights against Ukraine in the information field, and in real examples, unto the two main theses that are trying to give up Russian propaganda:
“Now the Russians are spreading two main theses. The first is about the allegedly large losses of the personal staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Such information is aimed at demoralizing the Ukrainian army from one way, and on the other, on the contrary, to raise a spiritual army. Therefore, in this situation, it can be noted that, first, during the war, the same of the parties does not publish accurate data of its losses, because the enemy is nigger and can adjust its plans, including to assume and calculate our plans. Now we can talk only about the ratio, which at the beginning of the 2014 and a large -scale invasion of 2022, brief: the number of dead on the Ukrainian side is much or much or more than times lower than the loss of the enemy. Yesterday we published these figures. If we talk about last week, in the area of operational responsibility of the operative-strategic groups of the Khortytsia troops, enemies were killed almost more times more than our servicemen. Speaking of the pronounced direction, the enemies were killed 5.3 times more than the Ukrainian people. The life of our warriors is the most valuable for us and is a priority in the time of planning military operations.
The second narrative, spread by the Russians to discredit military aid, refers to Bradley armored vehicles that partners provide us. " During the time briefing, Anna Malyar demonstrated a photo of Bradley BMP(M2 Bradley), in which the shell of the RSZV "Grad" was combined. In the first photo - the machine immediately after the direct number, on the second - a crew, which was successfully evacuated and continues to fulfill the tasks on other technique.

 Alexei Danilov
Ukraine should stand in the position of rejection of any nuclear blackmail. This emphasized Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexey Danilov.
He noted the increased mention of the threat of nuclear war and called the "manipulative" formulation of the question of the threat of Putin's use of nuclear weapons.
“The thesis that, in my opinion, will now actively move to the Kremlin(Yunovorskaya key to the fundamental Western Phobias)that the presence of a nuclear bomb should automatically exclude the resistance of a country that has no such weapons. The country is the object of an attack of a nuclear state, if you go proposed by logic, provokes the threat of nuclear apocalypse. And in such a sequence the object of condemnation becomes not the aggressor, but the victim
We want to tell us: give up and do not resist? We do not need your freedom, we need our comfort and safety? This opinion will be tried to form in the world to refuse to support Ukraine, which by its actions, it turns out, "provokes" Russia ", - said Alexei Danilov.
According to the NSDC Secretary, in order for this false and deceptive logic not to become, we must not tired firmly and consistently in the position of not receiving any nuclear blackmail.
"We are not afraid of the so -called" second army of the world "nor the first in size of existing Russia, nor Putin's bunker rats and his nuclear bunk. Let us only be one - to lose freedom and in the struggle for it we will go to the end, ”he added.
The problem of the Kremlin's nuclear madness, Oleksiy Danilov, is a non -violent exclusively Ukraine, it is the problem of the world.
“The world has long watched and if it did not knowingly help, then it did not interfere with the growth of the Russian monster. It was when Ukraine was forced to pass the second largest arsenal to the Russian nuclear arsenal, to equip the Russian Army Army with our winged rockets, when the world was a donor of modern technologies, a buyer of oil and gas, which became the basis for the financing of construction. When the international elites were corrupted and the Russian oligarchy was opened.

 The soldier Vladimir serves in one of the parts of the Kharkiv garrison. In the middle of June, he came to the Military Medical Officer, located in the Narobozhanshchyna to pass the Military Medical Commission.
He chose the time of visit himself, based on his official employment and state of health, with the help of special software "E-Merga".
 Visitor of the NMCC PNR Soldier's Lordimir
According to the command of the military-medical institution, the first version of the e-n-monk was introduced in February 2023.
-Four months ago, we used our own technological development to record and pass the Military Medical Commission,-explains the head of the departmental medical staff. - The results were quite significant then. In May, we will establish a better version of "E-Berg". I note that we have successfully implemented other technological innovations, namely: MIS MISTS SMART, specialized ER Hospital software, Tracker software and others.
By the way, from the beginning of a large-scale invasion of occupiers in this medical facility has increased the number of visitors among the defenders and defenders of Ukraine. Of course, the burden on all doctors increased proportionally, working with visitors in the clinic.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-15T94-00-00-04-00/harkiv-gospital-5-150x150.jpg) 
 The temporary executor of the chief of the clinic explained that through professional features, queues sometimes occur near the offices of such doctors as: neuropathologist, traumatologist or psychiatrist.She added that quite often they come to them boys and girls of the spare registration in the E-Brga system. For various reasons, some units of units do not yet enjoy the possibilities of innovation. Therefore, the warriors are divided by the corresponding paper documents for the VLK.
 -Of course, we do not refuse to anyone and accept everyone without records in "E-Berg". However, it should be understood that in such cases there is some correction of schedules of visiting doctors. There is another point here. Yes, if one is a well -deserved person after injury on crutches comes to us, then we somehow go to help her. But what do we do when such soldiers in one day do not get one or two? As a practitioner, E-Merga is a very efficiency in terms of the VLK. I believe that everything will gradually work out and all the employees will send people to us only after electronic registration, - said the military doctor.
According to this military medical institution, they do not hide problematic questions and are constantly working on their solution.

I wish health, dear Ukrainians! 
Report for this day. The first is that we have significant international steps that enhance our position in several directions.
The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution to support the European Taiuro -Atlantic aspirations of our people. There is a specific call for a leadership euro union to define a clear way of acquiring our state membership in the EU.
And in the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament captures the meaning of our Ukrainian universal in Euro -Atlantic security, which stipulates that the path of Ukraine in NATO is a state -of -the -art invitation to entry in the context of the preparation for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius. Time for integration and security is obviously came, and I thank you for the actual statement of this to all members of the European Parliament and Ms. President of the European Parliament Roberti Metzoli, as well as the head of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for constant irregular work with the parliament.
The second important international step for today is the bill on confiscation and transfer of our state as a reparation of the Russian state-the terrorist state. I thank the US senators who have a biparty support for this issue for justice for Ukraine's Tavi victims of Russian terror.
In dictatorships such as Russian, money is the highest value. And even more of persons who serve the management regime or are actually owners of state structures.
When the state-terrorist and all Russian persons whose labeling with the Kremlin loses its money with the Kremlin created the conditions for Russian aggression or which are an inviocean cover for Russian corrupt officials, then a very important goal will be achieved-they will feel what loss is. They do not respect life and are nothable when human lives are lost. The Russian dominant class does not appreciate the people and is ready to spend human lives for hundreds of thousands. But they regret the money - those who have appropriated by the way. They value their assets. They should be lost, and in favor of those who suffered from their aggression, from this terrorist war in favor of our country, our people.
Today he continued to appeal to the parliaments of our partners.He also spent telephone conversations with representatives of the two countries-Belize and Costa Rica. We build new partnerships for Ukraine-to support the formula of peace and our resolution in the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law as a whole. The discussion of Mr. Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister Belize is the opportunity to organize a meeting of Ukraine-Latin America. We can together give much more protection for freedom and equality of nations in the modern world.
An important report was today on the situation in Kherson region and in general, half -day countries, in our Dnieper after the Russian terrorist attack on Kakhovskaya HEP. Elimination of the consequences of catastrophe, assistance to people, providing drinking and all other sensitive and important issues. Government Schmigal, Klimenko Minister of Internal Affairs, Profile Deputy Head of the Kuleb Office, representatives of local authorities. Another report is the situation in Kryvyi Rih Taodes after recent strikes of terrorists.
And, of course, the front. I thank all our soldiers, every unit, every boost brigade for today - for today's fighting.
I will note especially six units. The Khortytsia fell-paratroopers of our powerful 80th Separate Brigade of DShV. "Tavriya"-warriors of our 23rd separate mechanized brigade, Marines of the 35th and 37th separate brigades, warriors of the 128th-equally mountain-assault Transcarpathian brigade and the 128th separate brigade of Silro ... !For strength, courage, but that you return to Ukraine the Ukrainian land and strengthen our Ukrainian will.
Glory to everyone and everyone who is now in battle, at combat posts and at combat operations!Glory to all who train our warriors!Who treats and rehabilitates defects and defenders after injuries!
Thank you all in the world who helps. And, by the way, the next "Ramstein" today has been quite effective. We are still strong!

The ministers of defense agencies have agreed on more than 50 countries, which have been brought into the meeting - in the article by the Army.
Allies of Ukraine have agreed new military assistance for defense forces 
Pentagon Head Lloyd Austin at a briefing following the meeting of the contact group on Defense of Ukraine in Ramstein format on June 15 declared that the Union countries of Ukraine have agreed on new military assistance for the defense forces.
Yes, a number of countries have reported training plans for Ukrainian military and support for Ukrainian equipment. Germany and Poland reported support for Ukrainian Leopard tanks. And the Netherlands and Denmark - about progress to train Ukrainian pilots.
Canada declared On the allocation of the package for $ 500 million to support Ukraine. 288 AIM-7 missiles will be awarded to Ukraine's Armed Forces to protect the sky. Also Canada:
Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said 116 of 200 armored machines that promised Ukraine have already been delivered, and 18 more have to deliver a tank week.
6750 assault rifles will also be delivered in the coming days; 1.1 million of cartridges 7.62 mm; 250 000 caliber cartridges 5.56 mm; 70 000 Sniper ammunition.Lloyd Austin noted that Italy also announced the provision of new, critical need for Ukraine. And several partners consider Ukraine support in the long run.
Norway and Germany announced packages for several years, and Denmark announced its package for about $ 2.6 billion for military assistance for 20124.
Lloyd Austin also recalled that the equipment received by Ukraine and weapons are consumed by Ukrainians withstand and bring victory closer.
“Patriot, Iris-T and Nasams have saved the lives of Ukrainians,” the minister emphasized, and urged the group members to continue to provide NAPPO and ammunition systems.
Mr Austin also assured that partners will provide Ukraine with this stage of assistance, but also one that the state will need a long run so that Ukraine can protect itself from further possible aggression by Russia.
In particular, as he explained, it is about plans to prepare the military. In his opinion, this will establish the foundations of future cooperations and the Armed Forces.
The head of the US defense agency also mentioned the announced new package of the United States worth more than $ 2 billion, which includes additional tubes for Patriot and HAWK systems, missiles, 105- and 203 mm. In addition, he noted that Biden President approved the transfer of the next $ 25 million benefit, which includes Nasams and Himars, additional Bradley, anti -tank weapons and more.
The Pentagon Head also emphasized the recent missile attacks of the Russians with a cover horn and flooding of large territories of Kherson region through the destruction of Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station. He noted that they are another reminder of the devastating innocent of Russian aggression for innocent civilians.
At the same time, Mr Austin noted that Ukrainians continue to inspire all the luminosity and resistance of the aggressor, the efforts to liberate their own territories and the restoration of the sovereignty of the state, and the Armed Forces by showing the extraordinary courage and skill.
He thanked all the participants in the Ramstein format for their support for Ukraine.
But once again he said that Russian President Putin, when starting his great war on Ukraine more than a year ago, thought he would easily win - he was wrong. Fighters for Ukraine 
The closure of the Ukrainian sky, in particular, the need to provide Ukraine with fighter generation was not for the first time voiced by the Ukrainian side, and the universities concentrated their efforts on strengthening the air defense systems for Ukraine, stating that giving fighters it is a long -term process.
However, today at the 13th meeting of the Contact Group on Assistance to Ukraine, Ramstein, Brussels, except the closure of the Ukrainian sky with the help of the Ukrainian air defense(Pentagon's head noted that strengthening the Ukrainian PPO is necessary for the protection of the civilian population and the critical infrastructure)Ukraine also received assurances from partners to start pilot training on modern fighters.  According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov after the meeting, he also wandered about the clear intention of the Allies to build a "fighter coalition".
According to the Minister of Defense, the Ukrainians will first begin training exercises of F-16 led by the Netherlands and Denmark. And then othericraines join.
Earlier it became known that Ukrainians will go to study at the F-16. The pilots were selected, they had a number of requirements. The Ministry of Defense also named the required F-16 for Ukraine, in particular, Ukraine hopes to receive from the Winning partners about 40-50 F-16 fighters and form three or four-levels for protecting the sky.
Recall that a few weeks ago, US President Joe Biden gave good to training Ukrainian pilots to work at the F-16, and the subsequent transfer of these fighters to the Ukrainian side. The United States was categorically opposed to conversations about modern -year -olds for the Armed Forces. Also, the other day Alexei Reznikov reported that it is possible to receive from the Allies not F-16, but fighters of another type.“Today, my colleagues Luxembourg François Bausha and Estonia Minister Khan Hannovurus have supported my idea of creating an IT Coalition of Ramstin. They are ready to take the leadership role in creating this group, ”he wrote.
Austin commented on the Russian statements about the Russian Allied Ukrainian Technology 
US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin during a meeting of the Ramstein contact group stated that the Russians show the same tuning equipment from different angles.
The head of the Pentagon noted that damage to military equipment on the field is fighting, but the Russian side is distributing photos and videos, depicting "those self -apple cars almost a thousand times from ten different angles."
“As for the loss of technique: this is war. Yes, we know that the damage of Napoli battle will be on both sides. But it is important that Ukrainians have the opportunity to display damaged equipment, to repair where possible, and return this technique to the battle. And also that they have means to continue to move forward, ”Austin said at a briefing after meeting the contact group from Ukraine's defense in Brussels.
He stressed that the damage to military equipment will continue, but "if not, Ukrainians still have many combat capabilities." Lloyd Austin also asserted that, as expected, it was a "difficult battle", but he believes in the victory of Ukraine.
 Ukraine is able to liberate its territories 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Ramstein Meeting Pressing Form, said that NATO representatives have decided today "how to protect and strengthen Ukraine's support. After all, Ukraine has become a counter -offensive assistance to NATO countries is important for success in the battlefield.
He noted that these successes are due to the courage and skills of Ukrainian soldiers, but they also demonstrate that the support of NATO countries as they attach Ukraine to Ukraine "actually relevant on the battlefield."We will remind, the day before, on June 14, Ukraine gave a clear signal to read the invitation to NATO membership during the July Summit of the Alliance.
Reference. The meeting of the contact group for assisting Ukraine in Ramstein format was founded in the spring of 2022 after the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. On April 26, Ramstein Air Force Air Force in Germany took place a first -time consultative group. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov after the meeting stated that there were "tectonic changes" in the philosophy of partners on the transmission of weapons. Since then, meetings of the advisory group have decided to conduct a month.
The previous 12th meeting took place on May 25. It discussed the strengthening of Ukrainian air defense, strengthening of "armored fist", repair production of military equipment.
On June 12, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov spoke about expectations from the future meeting in Ramstein format. .
According to the minister, these issues will be discussed during the Ramstin's Ramstein from the Netherlands, Denmark, USA and other countries of the Defense Commander. That is why, as Alexei Reznikov noted, representatives of the Air Force of the UKRAINE took part in the Ukrainian delegation at this meeting.
