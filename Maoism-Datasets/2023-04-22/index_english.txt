Our sanction packages are elaborated in detail, in particular, to synchronization by the correspondents. This is one of our common tasks - absolutely everyone who will end the faster end of the war, faster than our victory. The task is to remove any opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. Each Russian scheme that gives the sanction to overcomes this war, adds the opportunities to the aggressor.
Accordingly, the stricter sanction regime against Russia, which is more restrictions in front of the terrorist state and all the persons related to it, against the whole Russian economy of war, the faster will be the completion of aggression. And I thank everyone in the world who understands it.
It is important that global restrictive work on the Russian atomic industry has begun.
This industry not only generates funds for the aggressor budget, but also helps to depend on other states in the territory of which "energy" atomic projects are being realized. Any Kremlin energy is a weapon. The nuclear power of them is also a weapon.
And this, by the way, happens at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is used as weapons for blackmail of the world. For blackmail by catastrophe.
And it is good that Britain, America, France, Japan, Canada formed an alliance that can remove the atomic industry of the terrorist state from the global market.The Netherlands - thank you for increasing the air defense and for joint with Denmarks on tanks.
Thank you to Germany. There are new steps that will provide more peace in our sky, and ... can be new steps that will bring more peace to our earth. We expect this.

I thank Switzerland for new sanctions against Russian terrorists.
Next week we prepare in relations with partners no less effective than this one. Each such result for Ukraine is the lives of our people. It is the ability of our warriors to protect their lives, to reflect Russian assaults to prepare Ukrainian active actions.

The traitors received food from the invaders and the things that were brought to their own premises. The persons also had permission for the free movement of the area.

According to the Prime Minister during a government meeting, this is a significant step that Ukraine's abuse could get the necessary treatment or rehabilitation abroad, without unnecessary bureaucratic procedures.
“One of the priorities of the government is the reform of medical and social expert commissions of the Tavi-Medical Commissions. Today we adopt a resolution on the simplification of our wounded fighters for treatment abroad. Now such directions will be able to get in the medical institution where treatment is undergoing chireabilization. Without tightening, without queues, without bureaucracy, ”Denyshmigal said.
From now on, medical institutions, in which Ukraine's defenders are treated and/aparabilitation, will be able to determine independently the need to send them abroad. Conducting a consultation of a military medical institution is now needed.
That is, the medical institution, in which the defender of Ukraine is on treatment, will independently formulate the conclusion that the need for treatment for treatment abroad will tap a package of documents to the relevant state body, which is part of the sector of safety and defense.
Thus, the conclusion on the need to refer the defender of Ukraine abroad will be accepted without a consultation of a military medical institution.

It was noted that their number can reach from 16 to 300 thousand. Such a number of MEPUATES explained that the Russians began to take out our children in 2014 - since the occupation of the Krym and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
They also emphasized that violent deportation is again becoming stalmozing, because such crimes committed in the USSR were not at one time being. And the perpetrators have never been persecuted internationally. However, the current community was taken into account by this fact and the International Criminal Court of the Publishing House for the arrest of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and the Russian Deputy for the Rights of the Child Maria Lviv-Belova.
The EU continues to support Ukraine in investigations into war crimes against humanity. The EU Commission has already allocated more than 10 million euros to the International Criminal Court in the Hague, as well as identified 16 Russian landlords responsible for the forcible movement of children from temporary -corresponding territories.
The next step in a joint effort would be a conference organized by the European Commission and Poland. It is intended to combine international efforts to find forcibly exposed children from Ukraine.

 The Militation Media Center has a round table dedicated to the features of the robots returned from captivity by the military and the search for missing missing.
I understand the expectations of relatives and their expectations for our performance. One of them seeks to return their home from captivity as soon as possible. Aleks is that even now, in this second, hostilities are ongoing. And, perhaps even now, someone was missing at this moment, perhaps he was killed, and was taken prisoner. We know about every serviceman who has missed the missing, and we work for all. As soon as we manage to prove the process and get the result in the form of an exchange, the serviceman returns.

 This was stressed during a roundtable at the Military Media Center by the representative of the Coordination Staff on the management of prisoners of war Bogdanohrimenko.
For families who are worried that their boyfriend does not have the official status of the VREAER or in any database, I note separately: for the coordination headquarters, this is a problem. If there is at least a little hope that a person is alive, we will be able to redeem on the other side of his return home. This work is complex, far from public, but I think as soon as we can tell society everything, no one will hide anything from anyone. After the victory, we will open the information, how the negotiations were, what was focused on, what washed on the other side, and what mechanisms forced Russia to give our citizens, our servicemen, our defenders, our heroes. The work will not come down until we return everyone.

 This was stressed during a roundtable at the Military Media Center by the representative of the Coordination Staff on the management of prisoners of war Bogdanohrimenko. - The ICCH, according to its mandate, should check the maintenance sites of the health of servicemen who are in captivity, but it is not at the extent that regulates international law, - he said. Since June 2022. This was headed by the first Viceremier-Minister, Head of the Ministry of Integration Irin Vereshchuk. The work she organized was crucial because in the Present Wars the military was focused on repeling the attacks of the enemy. At the same time, the CMU Resolution No. 257 was elaborated, which determined the status and direction of the coordination headquarters. Ms. Irina headed the headquarters until May, and after the threat of capture of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv was removed, the decision to change the leadership of the coordination headquarters to the military was made. The Unara was headed by the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Kirilobudanov. Since June, we have started our communication with the ICRC. I note that what was in this Tszarin in early summer last year and now are two different things. Improved communication with other state authorities, in particular with the office of the Ombudsman of Human Rights Dmitry Lubinz and the Commissioner for Persons missing in the special circumstances of Oleg Kotenko, in general - all state structures who have applied to the ICRC and now give its positive results. to visit some places of maintenance of our captives by the territories of occupied Ukraine and the Russian Federation. But this was a little - they must perform the whole mandate. In the ICRC, the Russian Federation does not allow them to keep them… Sometimes we tell you, it is the advice of interaction.

According to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Energy and HCP Andriugers, more than 1,200 missiles and drones have released the Russian Federation on the key facilities of the country. Accordingly, the total loss caused by the Ukrainian energy system of Ukraine by attacks of Russian missiles and drones is estimated at billionardidals.
“Of course, the safety margin has significantly decreased and it needs to be drawn to the next winter. Today, we need to work for the passage of the next heating season is simpler and more predictable than this winter, ”Andrei Gerus said on the broadcasting of the only news.
The Chairman of the Committee informed that to prepare for the next winter, namely to restore the power system, Ukraine, according to the most conservative estimates, requires over UAH 40 billion.
"There are basic discussions around this: where to get money to repair the trapped objects of energy infrastructure, to establish additional protection and to create reserve stocks," - comments Andrei Gerus.
According to the Chairman of the Committee, Ukraine receives significant international assistance, but it is not enough to restore the power system to the level to abyigrand the uninterrupted supply of electricity to Ukrainians.
One way of accumulating money is to increase the tariff for electricity.
“In my opinion, the secured population has the opportunity to pay a higher tariff for electricity. If the business now has a tariff of 5.5 UAH per kWh, then the population consuming more than 250 kW-1.68 UAH, ”said Andrey Gerus.
The Chairman of the Committee added that the tariff for the population to the level of tariff for business will not be increased, but it is necessary to find the option that the society, the authorities and the opposition will be agreed.
The first deputy chairman of the Committee on Energy and HCP Alexei Kucherenkoconstaches that the electricity tariff for the population is significantly lower than the comprehensive European countries. But it is obvious that the wealth of most Ukrainians does not correspond to European.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, a key emphasis from 2019 should be made to prevent gas tariffs from growth and heat for the population to be released to their real cost. At the same time, it was possible to gradually increase the tariff for electricity for the category of relatively "wealthy consumers", but not to change the tariff for low -income Ukrainians, who are about a third.

 A spokesman of the united Press Center of Defense forces of Tavriysky Colonel Alexei Dmitrashkivsky on the air of Televahorfon ["Yeninovina"] told about the situation in the south of Ukraine and in the Donetsk region on the evening.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA).
— Протягом сьогоднішнього дня ворог уже шість разів атакував Вугледаравіаційними бомбами типу ФАБ-500. Наразі уточнюється інформація пропостраждалих серед цивільного населення. Що стосується Мар’їнського таАвдіївського напрямків, то там ворог продовжує штурмувати наші позиції. Урезультаті дії окупантів був пошкоджений об’єкт критичної інфраструктури вКарлівці. Останнє створило проблеми з водопостачанням в 67 населених пунктах,— повідомив полковник Дмитрашківський.
За його словами, в Авдіївці, яку ворог щодня обстрілює, ще залишаються близько1800 цивільних осіб, в тому числі й діти. Проте росіян це не турбує й вонипродовжують руйнувати місто.
— Свою тактику ворог не міняє. Вони атакують мотострілецькими відділеннями.Наприклад, учора всі атаки були здійсненні саме відділеннями або групами до 10осіб. Проте на Донеччині почастішали ворожі авіаційні удари, а також обстрілиз артилерії та РСЗВ окупантів. Відносний спокій на Запорізькому напрямкупояснюється тим, що окупанти укріплюють свої оборонні позиції, бо боятьсянашого контрнаступу, — уточнив речник об’єднаного пресцентру Сил оборониТаврійського напрямку.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the daily message of the D -Ukrainian people:
The other two sanctions lists are natural and legal persons that help sanctions against Russia, hold the property of military criminals and involve the reduction of freedom both in the territory of Russia itself and in our land.
Our sanction packages are elaborated in detail, and in particular - for synchronization from partners. This is one of our common tasks - absolutely everyone who will end the faster end of the war, faster than our victory. The task is to remove any opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. Each Russian scheme that allows you to bypass sanctions, adds time to this war, adds opportunities to the aggressor.
Accordingly, the sanction regime against Russia, which is more restricted in front of the terrorist state and all related persons, against the whole Russian economic economy of war, will be more likely to complete aggression. And I thank everyone in the world who understands it.
Glory to all our soldiers!Glory to all our heroes of different times who fought for the independence!Ukraine will always be free!Glory to Ukraine!

Нагадаю: Аппаза Куртамета російські силовики затримали 23 липня 2022 року наадмінмежі з тимчасово окупованим Кримом, куди він прямував до родичів. Того ждня звʼязок із ним зник. Про його місце перебування не було відомо до 8жовтня. Наприкінці лютого цього року окупанти розпочали судилище.
Росія не полишає репресивну політику стосовно представників корінного народуКриму — кримських татар. Усі обвинувачення на адресу громадян України єнадуманими і мають політично мотивоване підґрунтя, а вироки — незаконними.
Міжнародне гуманітарне право забороняє державі-окупанту застосовувати своєкримінальне законодавство на окупованій території.
Закликаю світову спільноту посилити політико-дипломатичний тиск на РФ доповного і безумовного звільнення всіх незаконно утримуваних українськихгромадян.
