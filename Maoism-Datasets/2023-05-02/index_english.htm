<h1>In Ukraine, the industry of prostheses needs serious reform - Mikhail Tsymbalyuk</h1>

<p>Currently, several thousand citizens of Ukraine are expecting prostheses that are easy to prepare and serve domestic specialists. According to current law, all prosthetics in Ukraine are free of charge. And this is very important to those citizens who doubt today whether a prosthesis is worth establishing. Here the answer should be unambiguous - worth it.</p>
<p>—The ballow of prostheses requires serious reform, because it has been released to the background, several important conditions of Ukraine were closed: Kyiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Cherkasy. The current state has planned more budgetary funds for 2023, because several citizens of Ukraine, especially servicemen, are expected to be prosthetized - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_CXb-tXcY">noted</a>The first deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Social Policy of Protection of Veterans Rights Mykhailo Tsymbalyuk.</p>
<p><strong> This year in the state budget for prosthetics there are more than UAH 356 million(Last year </strong> <strong> - less than UAH 24 million). Загалом у 2023 на реабілітаціювійськових заплановано понад 2,5 млрд грн. Окрім протезів, кошти підуть напротезно-ортопедичні вироби, спеціальні засоби для самообслуговування тазасоби для пересування.</strong></p>
<p>Михайло Цимбалюк наголосив на необхідності розвитку саме вітчизняної галузіпротезування, зокрема, що нам потрібні добре підготовлені лікарі та бригадиреабілітологів, здатні місяцями працювати над відновленням людини післявстановлення протеза.</p>
<p>— Коли ми звертаємося по допомогу до міжнародних партнерів, громадяни Українимають кілька місяців перебувати за кордоном з метою протезування. Ба більше, умайбутньому протези потребують обслуговування, а якщо протез встановлений закордоном, то громадянину доведеться виїжджати туди, витрачати кошти і час, —пояснив він.</p>
<p>Однозначно більш доцільно встановлювати протез, освоювати його та проходитиреабілітаційний курс у вітчизняних центрах протезування, вважає МихайлоЦимбалюк. В Україні працюють як державні, так і приватні реабілітаційніцентри, тож можна проаналізувати пропозиції і обрати — послуги з протезуваннябезкоштовні.</p>
<p>One of the problems of prosthetics is bureaucratized in communication between those who need prosthetics and government agencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, there is a problem, because when a person loses his limb, it is antening psychologically, so it is important that the local governments, the regulatory structures of the Ministry of Social Policy are not waiting for the citizen or citizen to talk to them, and they did the corresponding work themselves, - said Mykolacibalyuk. - It is important that people know where to go and not waste time, because the recovery period, from the beginning of the prosthesis and dosing, lasts from three to six months. It is a difficult process, and the more it begins, the more complex the future rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will remind, a serviceman who has a certificate of injury(Even if it is not yet issued a disability), is entitled to free receipt of the prosthesis regardless of the number of amputations.</p>
<p>The state prosthetics procedure is currently quite complicated, it provides for series. According to her now, the action algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p>First, the injured person must choose a prosthetic enterprise on his own, and it is difficult to use if you have never encountered it: not just evaluate the technical possible, providing appropriate personnel and honesty of the enterprise, giving prosthetics services.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the choice of the contractor, a contract with a prosthetic enterprise is signed, and it, for its part, concludes an agreement on the Ministry of Social Policy.</p>
<p>Among the existing problems, the most common is prosthetics delay. Usually, it may be due to the fact that businesses do not start work until the budget is received. On the other hand, if the enterprise does not have sufficient production capabilities, then the term of production of the prosthesis can also be delayed. Therefore, you should not delay and seek the prosthetics as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This Monday and New Week began with an hourly meeting with all levels of government and protection. Government, ministers, office. Reported by the head, heads of GUR and foreign intelligence service, the head of the SBU, the Secretarp.</p>
<p>The first question is the consequences of Russian blows, including missile. It was only in the past, from midnight to seven in the morning that 15 Russian rockets managed to bring down. But unfortunately, not everyone. Not all of them. We actively work with partners to the defense of our sky even more reliable.</p>
<p>They discussed at a morning meeting the likely behavior of the enemy in the near future, coordinated our defensive steps.</p>
<p>Separately - issues of weapons and shells for our soldiers. Also, the situation in the still occupied territory and counteraction to Russia. No chance of the occupier on our land!The enemy is only destruction.</p>
<p>Here's just one example today. Chernihiv region, the village of Lizunivka, is the North region, near the state border. There, the Russian aviation was destroyed by a still Ukrainian school ... Unfortunately, this blow took the life of a teenager - a guy of 2009 birth ... 14 years old!He was just near the school. My muddy and loved ones!</p>
<p>Pavlograd of Dnipropetrovsk region. Terrorists rockets have taken away the lives of two people, very young guys ... My condolences to families!More than forty people - women, children, men - received help after injuries and injuries.</p>
<p>For each such impact, Russian invaders will receive our answer. And I thank our warriors who provide it daily and every night. Which protect our position, reflect Russian assaults, help their fire brothers, who are in positions, and to the maximum destroy the occupier. The more Ukrainian comprehension, the more Ukrainian mutual support, the more Russian evil is building.</p>

<p>This is stated in the post on Facebook of the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Oleg Nikolenko in response to the Natural Science of the German Press Agency(DPA).</p>
<p>Він нагадав, що у контексті підготовки до саміту <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>In Vilnius, German journalists, referring to unnamed interlocutors, claim that the steps to Vnato's membership can be distracted from "much more important support for Ukraine". In addition to DPA, new obligations to NATO can push Russia to do the aggressive war. Further, the agency concludes that progress is likely to be possible only after Ukraine has achieved success in combating Russian aggression.</p>
<p>"These arguments are a set of false judgments that have long lost its relevance," Nikolenko said.</p>
<p>He stated that the battles are really important, but Ukraine has already achieved success in defense against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>“In February 2022, skeptics gave Ukraine 72 hours, and optimists - a week.The heroism of Ukrainian defenders and defenders, as well as international support, Ukraine not only stood a blow, but also conducts successful operations of discharge of occupied territories. It will not be an exaggeration to call the Ukrainian army the strongest army of Europe. Ukrainians are now making the greatest contribution of Vevro -Atlantic security, ”the Foreign Ministry spokesman.</p>
<p>In addition, he noted, earlier we have already heard arguments about the need to maintain steps that could "provoke" Russia for new provocation. In this context, Nikolenko quoted the Minister of Out -of -Kulebu, who emphasized that "the only thing that provokes Russia is ceniferation." Instead, promoting on the path to Ukraine's accession to Natov will quench its aggression, predicted a foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>He also believed that the current international support of Ukraine in the protidium by the Russian invaders does not contradict, but on the contrary complements the process of acquiring the acquisition in NATO.</p>
<p>“The future of Euro -Atlantic security is resolved on the battlefield in Ukraine, and the introductory state to NATO will guarantee the strategic security of all the Alliance. Ukraine is not a problem, but an advantage for NATO. Therefore, in response to the calculation of anonymous sources, we emphasize that Ukraine's accession to NATO -Winteresa of the Alliance itself and urge partners to show leadership, ”Nikolenko emphasized.He added that Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is clearly defined Ukrainian expectations: at a summit in Vilnius, Ukraine expects to obtain a commitment from allies, which will determine the path to our NATO accession.</p>
<p>"The time for such a step has long been raised," the Foreign Ministry spokesman summed up.</p>
<p>As reported, the German press agency(DPA)With reference to the NATO, NATO members such as the United States and Germany have recently made it clear that they did not want to take any extent that would go beyond NATO Declaration from 2008.</p>

<p>The event was also attended by the Deputy Head of OP Igor Zhovkva, reports Ukrinform with reference to <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/mi-hochemo-otrimati-politichnij-signal-yakij-uzhe-sogodni-ch-82597"></a>.</p>
<p>The key topic was to discuss strategic security issues, such as working with international partners of Ukraine's accession to NATO, intermediate security guarantees, military-technical and humanitarian support for our states, etc.</p>
<p>According to Yermak, Ukraine expects a clear signal from NATO to support her own members at the Vilnius Summit. At the same time, he noted the importance of providing effective security guarantees for the entire period, which precedes the full integration into the Alliance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-02T-20-52-00-03-00/1683060645-425.jpeg" />“We see the opportunity to make these guarantees real, and they have to work Ukraine's output in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>. We also want to maintain a political signal that will clearly consolidate Ukraine's future today, and there will be no return journey. There will be only a matter of time, ”the OPE said.</p>
<p>He added that Ukraine is making every effort, working individually, and finding appropriate arguments to dispel any non-alternative journal of our country's accession to the Alliance.</p>

The recently presented McFola-Ermakasancial Plan 2.0 group provides a set of measures that will be able to have an impact on the aggressor country and reduce its military potential.

<p>"There is no point in talking about the probable association with those who will turn it out of it because it has absolutely distinctive values and priorities. There is no point in this sense. We do not need collaborators in our ranks who hate all -Ukrainian, or those who are even horrors caused by full -scale by the Russian aggression, they did not open their eyes and did not become the impetus for the reassessment of the stay of the Moscow Patriarchate. At the same time, we are open to those who sincerely want to serve God and their Ukrainian people, and not just masked it as Pharisees, a variety of meaningless justifications "Russian measure", - said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-epifanij"></a>.</p>
<p>He also noted that the return of the shrines, such as Pochaiv Lavra, the Kiev Lavra depends on the determination of the authorities.</p>

However, they are still preferable to use those who really do not like this people. Because our language and culture does not like to know and does not want to know our true historium and in unison with the Kremlin does Our right to state and ecclesiastical independence. When and how and how these people cease to parasite on our shrines, depends on the Ukrainian authorities and its determination in this really important issue of the state, "he said.</p>

<p>“The movement of Ukraine to the European Union is not only ambitions, but also specific results. We have a successful sectoral integration into the EU. Now we are making an important route to combine our power systems, ”Shmigal added.</p>
<p>“The total cost of the project was UAH 350 million. In addition, low -pass equipment was provided free of charge by our Polish partners, ” - said in <a href="https://t.me/Ukrenergo/2066"></a>NEC "Ukrenergo".</p>
<p>It is noted that the total length of the line reaches almost 400 km, with more than 70% of them passing the territory of Ukraine. The line is connected to the main energy network through an open distribution device on one of the Ukrainian energy objects.</p>
<p>“The bulk of the work was performed in this node so that the electricity produced by the Ukrainian energy system could be converted to European voltage of 400 kV and transferred to Europe. 125 experts worked on the construction of the site on the side of Ukraine for five months during the war, ”Ukrenergo added.</p>

<p>According to her, the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights over the last half of the year has monitoring about 300 such objects.</p>
<p>"There is a problem of lack of personal space. We see that we have people in some places in gyms, sports complexes, some live in one room of 10-15 people. These are adults, children, citizens of different sexes," she said.</p>

In particular, this concerns the access of children to education.</p>
<p>Also, a representative of the commissioner pointed to improper sanitary and hygienic specifications in the MKP: there is not water everywhere and the opportunity to make appropriate repairs.</p>
<p>Altunina stated that the problem of molding is a problem, apparently, 90 percent of all places of compact settlement.</p>
<p>"Another issue is the notability of the ICP to the needs of people with disabilities. The next problem is failure to comply with fire safety requirements, in particular, almost everywhere non -exgrade, etc.," she said.</p>
<p>According to the Ombudsman Office, they came to a disappointing conclusion that the state, calling on people to leave their place of residence, left them from the temporarily occupied territories and from the territories where the active fighting was underway, left them on its own with the problem of placement in the ICP.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://www.ucab.ua/ua/pres_sluzhba/novosti/za_kviten_misyats_eksport_ukrainskoi_agroproduktsii_skorotivsya_na_tretinu"></a>It is noted that the indicator of Ukrainian agroexport in April is the worst last 8 months.</p>
<p>The Association added that last month the problems with the implementation of export release were observed on almost all channels. In particular, the greatest damage was caused by: sabotage of full work of the "grain corridor" by the Russian stage, the prohibition of import of all agricultural products and a temporary prohibition of transitpolsha, as well as the prohibition of import of certain types of agro -industrial products by Housing, Bulgaria and Slovakia.</p>
<p>At the same time, not all the products shipped in April have managed to physically transform the border and a considerable amount of transport is still in queues.</p>
<p>It is reported that in April 2023, the fall in the volume of exported renovated all groups of agricultural products except vegetable oils. The greatest fall in exports was observed in the export of oilseeds.</p>
<p>According to UKAB, last month Ukraine exported 3.9 million tonnes of grain(Corn proportion - 59%, wheat - 36%, barley - 5%)- This is 31% less than the loose. Exports of oilseeds fell by 68% - up to 216.6 thousand tons(Soybean share –77%, sunflower seeds - 18% and rapeseed - 4%).</p>
<p>У квітні Україна <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-eksport"> </a>564.2 thousand rope oils(Product of sunflower oil - 96%, soybean - 4%). Експорт олійминулого місяці зріс на 1%. Експорт макухи після вилучення рослинних олійскоротився на 42% – до 262,5 тис. т (Sunflower proportion - 89%, soybean - 11%).</p>
<p>В асоціації вважають, що вирішення питання з відновленням експортних поставоку сусідні дружні країни дає підстави сподіватися, що наступного місяцяпоказники будуть кращі. Ще більше покращити ситуацію може налагодженняповноцінної роботи «зернового коридору». Це може бути досягнуто або за рахунокнормальної роботи російською стороною, або відновлення вільного судноплавства.</p>
<p>Як повідомляв Укрінформ, у квітні 2023 року Польща, Угорщина, Словаччина таБолгарія запровадили тимчасову заборону на імпорт зерна та інших видівсільськогосподарської продукції з України.</p>

<p>The event was also attended by the Deputy Head of OP Igor Zhovkva, reports Ukrinform with reference to <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/mi-hochemo-otrimati-politichnij-signal-yakij-uzhe-sogodni-ch-82597"></a>.</p>
<p>The key topic was to discuss strategic security issues, such as working with international partners of Ukraine's accession to NATO, intermediate security guarantees, military-technical and humanitarian support for our states, etc.</p>
<p>According to Yermak, Ukraine expects a clear signal from NATO to support her own members at the Vilnius Summit. At the same time, he noted the importance of providing effective security guarantees for the entire period, which precedes the full integration into the Alliance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-02T23-52-00-03-00/1683060645-425.jpeg" />“We see the opportunity to make these guarantees real, and they have to work Ukraine's output in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>. We also want to maintain a political signal that will clearly consolidate Ukraine's future today, and there will be no return journey. There will be only a matter of time, ”the OPE said.</p>
<p>He added that Ukraine is making every effort, working individually, and finding appropriate arguments to dispel any non-alternative journal of our country's accession to the Alliance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-02T23-52-00-03-00/1683060645-818.jpeg" />As it is noted, an important topic of conversation was also a further increase of economic pressure on Russia. The recently presented McFola-Ermakasancial Plan 2.0 group provides a set of measures that will be able to have an impact on the aggressor country and reduce its military potential. In this context, it is primarily about attracting G7 countries.</p>
<p>The head of the Presidential Office also expressed his hope for the continuation of the dialogue from the global South and their involvement in the implementation of the Ukrainian formular, proposed by President Vladimir Zelensky.</p>

Such creative cooperation demonstrates the unity of the army and the people for the sake of a unique method - victory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ukrainians have survived the grueling year of armed aggression of the Russian Federation, and in social traces of moral decline. That is why we decided to discharge the atmospheric that we know the best - organized a concert. Our nation is not in vain recognized as a specialist, and as for me, the song helps in the most difficult moments,-said the head of the orchestra of a separate artillery brigade named after the General Houseoleksiya Diamond Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Vitaliy Matsyuk Major.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T54-00-00-04-00/maczyuk.jpg" />The basis of the repertoire of the concert program were Ukrainian pop songs. The care of concert programs was the performance of songs that became a kind of symbols of the struggle of the Ukrainian people against the rashist invasion: "Oh, Luzichervon Kalina ..", "This dream, this dream", "Russian ship, go ... Hey, gay".</p>
<ul>

<p>The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov believes that due to defeat on the Bourf field, another "goodwill gesture" can be voiced under the pretext of man -made catastrophe in the territory of his country.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/907512.html">told</a>In an interview with the Interfax-Ukraine agency, the Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine, in the Kremlin, the search for possible scenarios, how the next success of the Ukrainian army can be justified within its socialization.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you already observe a number of public statements on Russian resources, you can see that the phrases are already heard, saying: Alexei Reznikov emphasizes. "In the event of another success of the Ukrainian army, which is absolutely expected and for them, you need to understand how to" sell "inside, how to give it to the people?" They were overheated by expectations: Kiev for three days and "their" in three weeks. And although propaganda in the Russian Federation works perfectly, but every time everything is more difficult. "</li>
</ul>
<p>The head of the defense department also suggested that there would be a "gesture of goodwill" by the evidence of some cataclysm.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not my forecast, but reasoning, but still I am not surprised if they appear in the script of a problem, a serious catastrophic species, man -made, in Russia. For example, something will happen to a power plant, a hydroelectric power plant, NPPs, there will be risks to the population, and this requires the number of government attention, the accumulation of resources, including soldiers. And so they will seem to explain to people why active fighting in Ukraine. That is, they have to voice the "goodwill gesture" under the guise of some cataclysm of the Russian scent, - said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/golovna-5.jpg" />- The first creation of our Sirko UAV enterprise is a tactical reconnaissance type with a fixed wing. He can collect reconnaissance information, providing a permanent video with the operator at a distance of up to 30 kilometers, the Vafline mode-up to 50 km,-says Skyssist, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Skyssist Scientific and Production Company LLC.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/1-12.jpg" />According to manufacturers, SIRKO UAVs are made of cast housing, that is, this feature allows to organize the process of assembling the apparatus on the conveyor to provide its mass production.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can collect up to 1 thousand UAVs a month. At the same time, with proper financing, we can scale our production facilities, as the stamping technology allows you to make about 200 sides a day. The cost of a non -station without a station is $ 3,000. With the ground station, depending on the completion - up to $ 9,000, - says Krynichko.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sirko has a size of 93 centimeters in wings, it is considered super -light because it will only lead 1.37 kilograms. The battery charge is enough to overcome the distance to 130-140 kilometers at an altitude of about 1 thousand meters. In the air, this fabric is up to one and a half hours depending on the weather - for example, the spinning wind is decreasing.</p>

With a sustainable connection, the drone proves the video on board the operator in an online mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, the operator can instantly make a decision on further actions on line Front or transmits information to the relevant units, - the head of the Supervisory Board shares the subtlets of the drone.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-4.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/5-4-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

<p>According to the designers, the aircraft itself is made of polymer material, which is completely radio transparent - in the mode of radio silence the means of electronic struggle of the enemy is not seen or perceived as a bird.</p>
<p>It distinguishes Sirko from the rest of the famous UAV brands and the fact that its operators can get it from shelter, for example, a dugout, placing the antenna and the mast from the human location.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-02T77-00-00-04-00/7-4.jpg" />- For example, known to all UAV MAVIC is only manually controlled. And its pultication emit radio waves, which the enemy can fix. That is, the safety assembly to stay on the terrain can be a very short time, the UAV flight will also be short -lived. The structure of our complex extends the work of the operator, and can save his life in the event that the rebuper records the work of the station and opens the fire in its direction, - explains Krynichko.</p>
<p>According to manufacturers, you can master the control of SIRKO UAV for two to three weeks. The school of operators is directly in production.</p>
<p>According to Igor Krynichko, the enterprise is currently at the stage of signature of the state agreement for the supply of these complexes, in particular the change in defense.</p>
<p>In addition, the SIRKO UAV developers announced the presentation of his youngest brother - a new shock drone of Ukrainian production.</p>

<li>It is clear. The number one task is to fight. In addition, new challenges have emerged and solutions for which they are looking for right now, because earlier this experience has not been made. Here, in fact, the standard procedure - to appoint a wounded after treatment, which he is able to occupy, during the war, became for combat commanders. Because the full -scale war dictates its conditions. The wounded who cannot complete the combat missions and are brought to the commanders of the commanders to other positions!- said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacancies in the Armed Forces are ten times more than the wounded in the appointment.</p>
<p>The problem is known with it already worked with the working group of the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The corresponding order of the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces is being prepared - and this should be the issue of those who are now waiting for the appointment. Changes in nature are also prepared for the order of 402 of the Ministry of Defense and the legislation.</p>

<ul>
<li>In general, the numbers about losses on both sides are different. If we talk about the Russians, such data in their reports publishes daily the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is important to realize that those who make such counting in this figure are invested in this figure. Do they mean only dead or injured too? After all, the wounded language also belongs to losses, because they then either return to the system or return there after a long time after treatment, - said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, in the conditions of conducting active fighting actions, it is difficult to calculate the losses, so to speak, in meaning. And such difficulty, in particular, is that the commander that should do it during the battle perform other tasks. And can only be done after the battle is over.</p>
<p>-But again, the accuracy of calculation depends on many factors. In particular, from whether the bodies are found, can they be identified and what category do they belong to - the dead or missing? In addition, there are cases where the technique where personnel could be located. But under such conditions, the count is still approximate, because we know conditional that there are so many people in the same tank,-said Anna Malyar.</p>

<p>According to her, the system was built earlier in this direction no longer Moglav to be such a heavy load and it was necessary to put into operation the corresponding corresponding changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier, even in 2014–2015, this system could still work with existing ones and with appropriate paper document management. But post -wide -scale Russian invasion was impossible and it became obvious that it is necessary to change the very approaches to the organization of work of the VLK. In order for you to understand-the military-medical commissions pass not only soldiers who were injured and visited by those who have been opened by criminal proceedings against whom the unauthorized leaving of combat positions,-the Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anna Malyar also said that, on behalf of the head of the domestic defense department Alexei Reznikov, she was together with the commander of the medical forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine this weekend personally made a trip along the Line Front and on the spot checked the work created there by the military hospital.</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere I did not see the queue, somewhere there were queues. Talking to the servicemen, we came to the conclusion that some problematic issues about the work of the VLK can be resolved organizationally. Other problems require the law at the legislative level. In this sense, it can be noted that today the People's Deputies of Ukraine in the second reading voted changes in the additions of important laws that simplify paper document circulation and generally self -proceeding of the VLK. Therefore, a huge step towards improving the robotic and medical commissions has already been taken,-said Anna Malyar.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, according to the Deputy Head of the domestic defense department, the VLK commissions were also created at the basic institutions of health care. And the Ministry of Defense together with the Ministry of Health Taminista, they work in the direction of digitalization and gradual implementation of electronic document management in the work of VLK.</p>

<p>According to Anna Malyar, in this way, the invaders try, so to speak, to blur our ethnic composition.</p>
<ul>
<li>So in the 21st century it sounds very wild. But, as the Soviet Kermanich Stalin, Russia is going to mix Ukrainians with certain ethnic groups. For this purpose, they force people from different regions of the aggressor and displace them in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, ”the Deputy Minister of Defense said.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Anna Malyar, people of the same ethnic composition who have fallen victims of armed aggression are always prone to unification and resistance. And to prevent this, to share them, the enemy and mixes Ukrainians with representatives of their ethnic groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier, we heard about such methods only from the history and stories of our grandmothers Tadidus who lived in Stalin's times. It was perceived by us tragic, but we did not remember what it could happen today.

<p>The number of casualties among civilians is estimated by about 4 million people.</p>
<ul>
<li>In total, demographic losses - 13 million 850 thousand people without taking into account Zakarpattya and Crimea. To reach pre -war population(41 million), Ukraine had to recover 19 years, - the scientist emphasized.</li>

Thus, in Kyiv, 200 thousand, from 900 thousand, in Odessa - from the pre -war 600 thousand people - about 200 thousands, in Dnipropetrovsk - from half a million - 100 thousand inhabitants.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is also worth adding post -war losses, which are undoubtedly a consequence of the war of Stalin's policies in the war, - Lyudmila Rybchenko emphasized. —To, not so long ago, they began to explore the famine of 1946-1947, scale.

It is for the development of such a permanent representative of the President of Ukraine to Tamil Tashevasi with representatives of the public and public sector. Tabolagi friends gathered at one table to discuss in detail the future youth policy on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tamila.tasheva/posts/pfbid02r26oTAAGBxXp5PppuLLxMPJZyZFmaCzeTbJvsJLAQz3HXZamcNxTVNPdPQoFDeYHl">reports</a>Permanent representative of the President of Ukraine to Tamil Tashev.</p>
<p>“Our meeting lasted more than two hours, for which we managed to outline the future work: attracting investments in the development of youth centers, organization of students' exchange programs - both internal and in -the -world mobility of young people - training not only future specialists, advice, preparation of future teaching. For the sake of restoring the activities of educational institutions, ”she stressed.</p>
<p>Marina Papapenko - Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine - shared the interest that youth policy should be involved in youthful people of representatives of indigenous peoples of Ukraine, as it will be able to satisfy the unique request of Crimea.</p>
<p>We also discussed those messages that we already have to actively communicate both the average Ukrainians from the controlled territories of Ukraine, as well as among those citizens of our state, who had to survive all these years of occupation. This is an important question, which is as a civil society - we must achieve synergy.</p>
<p>“They have decided with colleagues that the representation will prepare Brif as a result of the discussion, provide for reading and submitting proposals and planning the next one for further work on the vision of youth policy in deookupowtokrime.</p>
<p>I feel that this is the impetus that will eventually lead to future decisions, but also a politician that we will direct to the reintegration of our Ukrainian half, ”Tamila Tasheva said.</p>
<p>We continue to work for the main goal - the de -occupation of Crimea and its reintegration!</p>
