Currently, several thousand citizens of Ukraine are expecting prostheses that are easy to prepare and serve domestic specialists. According to current law, all prosthetics in Ukraine are free of charge. And this is very important to those citizens who doubt today whether a prosthesis is worth establishing. Here the answer should be unambiguous - worth it.
—The ballow of prostheses requires serious reform, because it has been released to the background, several important conditions of Ukraine were closed: Kyiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Cherkasy. The current state has planned more budgetary funds for 2023, because several citizens of Ukraine, especially servicemen, are expected to be prosthetized - noted The first deputy chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Social Policy of Protection of Veterans Rights Mykhailo Tsymbalyuk.
This year in the state budget for prosthetics there are more than UAH 356 million(Last year - less than UAH 24 million). Загалом у 2023 на реабілітаціювійськових заплановано понад 2,5 млрд грн. Окрім протезів, кошти підуть напротезно-ортопедичні вироби, спеціальні засоби для самообслуговування тазасоби для пересування. 
Михайло Цимбалюк наголосив на необхідності розвитку саме вітчизняної галузіпротезування, зокрема, що нам потрібні добре підготовлені лікарі та бригадиреабілітологів, здатні місяцями працювати над відновленням людини післявстановлення протеза.
— Коли ми звертаємося по допомогу до міжнародних партнерів, громадяни Українимають кілька місяців перебувати за кордоном з метою протезування. Ба більше, умайбутньому протези потребують обслуговування, а якщо протез встановлений закордоном, то громадянину доведеться виїжджати туди, витрачати кошти і час, —пояснив він.
Однозначно більш доцільно встановлювати протез, освоювати його та проходитиреабілітаційний курс у вітчизняних центрах протезування, вважає МихайлоЦимбалюк. В Україні працюють як державні, так і приватні реабілітаційніцентри, тож можна проаналізувати пропозиції і обрати — послуги з протезуваннябезкоштовні.
One of the problems of prosthetics is bureaucratized in communication between those who need prosthetics and government agencies.
We will remind, a serviceman who has a certificate of injury(Even if it is not yet issued a disability), is entitled to free receipt of the prosthesis regardless of the number of amputations.
The state prosthetics procedure is currently quite complicated, it provides for series. According to her now, the action algorithm is as follows:
First, the injured person must choose a prosthetic enterprise on his own, and it is difficult to use if you have never encountered it: not just evaluate the technical possible, providing appropriate personnel and honesty of the enterprise, giving prosthetics services.
Secondly, after the choice of the contractor, a contract with a prosthetic enterprise is signed, and it, for its part, concludes an agreement on the Ministry of Social Policy.
Among the existing problems, the most common is prosthetics delay. Usually, it may be due to the fact that businesses do not start work until the budget is received. On the other hand, if the enterprise does not have sufficient production capabilities, then the term of production of the prosthesis can also be delayed. Therefore, you should not delay and seek the prosthetics as soon as possible.

 Ukraine's accession to NATO - in the interests of the Alliance itself, arguments against it are the imprisonment of false judgments, which have long lost their relevance.
This is stated in the post on Facebook of the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Oleg Nikolenko in response to the Natural Science of the German Press Agency(DPA).
Він нагадав, що у контексті підготовки до саміту In Vilnius, German journalists, referring to unnamed interlocutors, claim that the steps to Vnato's membership can be distracted from "much more important support for Ukraine". In addition to DPA, new obligations to NATO can push Russia to do the aggressive war. Further, the agency concludes that progress is likely to be possible only after Ukraine has achieved success in combating Russian aggression.
"These arguments are a set of false judgments that have long lost its relevance," Nikolenko said.
He stated that the battles are really important, but Ukraine has already achieved success in defense against Russian aggression.
“In February 2022, skeptics gave Ukraine 72 hours, and optimists - a week.The heroism of Ukrainian defenders and defenders, as well as international support, Ukraine not only stood a blow, but also conducts successful operations of discharge of occupied territories. It will not be an exaggeration to call the Ukrainian army the strongest army of Europe. Ukrainians are now making the greatest contribution of Vevro -Atlantic security, ”the Foreign Ministry spokesman.
In addition, he noted, earlier we have already heard arguments about the need to maintain steps that could "provoke" Russia for new provocation. In this context, Nikolenko quoted the Minister of Out -of -Kulebu, who emphasized that "the only thing that provokes Russia is ceniferation." Instead, promoting on the path to Ukraine's accession to Natov will quench its aggression, predicted a foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
He also believed that the current international support of Ukraine in the protidium by the Russian invaders does not contradict, but on the contrary complements the process of acquiring the acquisition in NATO.
“The future of Euro -Atlantic security is resolved on the battlefield in Ukraine, and the introductory state to NATO will guarantee the strategic security of all the Alliance. Ukraine is not a problem, but an advantage for NATO. Therefore, in response to the calculation of anonymous sources, we emphasize that Ukraine's accession to NATO -Winteresa of the Alliance itself and urge partners to show leadership, ”Nikolenko emphasized.He added that Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is clearly defined Ukrainian expectations: at a summit in Vilnius, Ukraine expects to obtain a commitment from allies, which will determine the path to our NATO accession.
"The time for such a step has long been raised," the Foreign Ministry spokesman summed up.
As reported, the German press agency(DPA)With reference to the NATO, NATO members such as the United States and Germany have recently made it clear that they did not want to take any extent that would go beyond NATO Declaration from 2008.

 - The first creation of our Sirko UAV enterprise is a tactical reconnaissance type with a fixed wing. He can collect reconnaissance information, providing a permanent video with the operator at a distance of up to 30 kilometers, the Vafline mode-up to 50 km,-says Skyssist, the chairman of the supervisory board of the Skyssist Scientific and Production Company LLC.
 According to manufacturers, SIRKO UAVs are made of cast housing, that is, this feature allows to organize the process of assembling the apparatus on the conveyor to provide its mass production.
Sirko has a size of 93 centimeters in wings, it is considered super -light because it will only lead 1.37 kilograms. The battery charge is enough to overcome the distance to 130-140 kilometers at an altitude of about 1 thousand meters. In the air, this fabric is up to one and a half hours depending on the weather - for example, the spinning wind is decreasing.

According to the designers, the aircraft itself is made of polymer material, which is completely radio transparent - in the mode of radio silence the means of electronic struggle of the enemy is not seen or perceived as a bird.
It distinguishes Sirko from the rest of the famous UAV brands and the fact that its operators can get it from shelter, for example, a dugout, placing the antenna and the mast from the human location.
 - For example, known to all UAV MAVIC is only manually controlled. And its pultication emit radio waves, which the enemy can fix. That is, the safety assembly to stay on the terrain can be a very short time, the UAV flight will also be short -lived. The structure of our complex extends the work of the operator, and can save his life in the event that the rebuper records the work of the station and opens the fire in its direction, - explains Krynichko.
According to manufacturers, you can master the control of SIRKO UAV for two to three weeks. The school of operators is directly in production.
According to Igor Krynichko, the enterprise is currently at the stage of signature of the state agreement for the supply of these complexes, in particular the change in defense.
In addition, the SIRKO UAV developers announced the presentation of his youngest brother - a new shock drone of Ukrainian production.

In addition, there are cases where the technique where personnel could be located. But under such conditions, the count is still approximate, because we know conditional that there are so many people in the same tank,-said Anna Malyar.

 Good government policies need good, meaningful plans. It is for the development of such a permanent representative of the President of Ukraine to Tamil Tashevasi with representatives of the public and public sector. Tabolagi friends gathered at one table to discuss in detail the future youth policy on the Crimean Peninsula.
About it reports Permanent representative of the President of Ukraine to Tamil Tashev.
“Our meeting lasted more than two hours, for which we managed to outline the future work: attracting investments in the development of youth centers, organization of students' exchange programs - both internal and in -the -world mobility of young people - training not only future specialists, advice, preparation of future teaching. For the sake of restoring the activities of educational institutions, ”she stressed.
Marina Papapenko - Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports of Ukraine - shared the interest that youth policy should be involved in youthful people of representatives of indigenous peoples of Ukraine, as it will be able to satisfy the unique request of Crimea.
We also discussed those messages that we already have to actively communicate both the average Ukrainians from the controlled territories of Ukraine, as well as among those citizens of our state, who had to survive all these years of occupation. This is an important question, which is as a civil society - we must achieve synergy.
“They have decided with colleagues that the representation will prepare Brif as a result of the discussion, provide for reading and submitting proposals and planning the next one for further work on the vision of youth policy in deookupowtokrime.
I feel that this is the impetus that will eventually lead to future decisions, but also a politician that we will direct to the reintegration of our Ukrainian half, ”Tamila Tasheva said.
We continue to work for the main goal - the de -occupation of Crimea and its reintegration!
