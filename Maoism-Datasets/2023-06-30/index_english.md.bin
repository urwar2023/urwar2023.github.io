He stated this by presenting the benchmarks of the future document with the Polyar Session of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of the Constitution Day of Ukraine. About it [reports](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/volodimir-zelenskij-zaproponuvav-osnovni-napryami-transforma-83905)The official website of the President of Ukraine.

"We have to go during this time such a path that other peoples have overcome for decades. Ukraine will have special attention, special trust in the world, and every manifestation of attention and trust should be focused on the development of Ukraine and all aspects in our country," the president stressed.

The first specific purpose for Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the GDP's achievement in a trillion dollars, and the potential of our country is able to suggest.

The second point is the rejection of the idea, as if the cheap work of Ukrainians is a competitive advantage.

"We aim to reach such a level of remuneration that could be brought to the formula" neighbors in the European Union plus 30%. " This is a fair goal, a war of war. Ukraine of victory will be a bet on qualified work. Aotge, for education, ‚Äùthe Head of State said.

The President also emphasized the need to spread English, because it is a language of global cooperation, business, and science of taglobal communication.

The third crucial task, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, identified the return of the home of a large number of our citizens who went beyond the state. It is necessary to create as many jobs as possible.

"The transformation of every sector of the economy, any social practice and all spheres of public administration should answer the question: how many new workplace will give Ukraine a specific decision, a specific initiative," he said.

The President also advocated the formation of a new policy of support of paternity. According to the head of state, the second and third child in the family should be happiness, not restriction of opportunities.

To help families, a special application "Dream" will be created, which will support everything concerning parents and children: services that are needed for children, the child for development, education, security, contact with the state, etc. The digital transformation team of Ukraine will present the application in the fall, Vladimir Zelensky reported.‚ÄúEveryone who creates new jobs in Ukraine creates the basis for economic leadership of Ukraine. Ukraine of victory will protect every person's ability to work as much and as a person desires. We need to summarize the labor legislation, ‚Äùhe said.

The seventh point of transformation of the state, according to the President, has a stalkin rational tax agreement between the state and society and the real -alienation of property.

‚ÄúI am a supporter of tax reductions. But now, during such a war and the obvious dependence of Ukraine on cooperation with financial donors, we cannot allow ourselves to reduce taxes. But when Ukraine of victory itself becomes a member for the world, our level of opportunity will be higher. Reduced taxes have to determine the increased tax honesty, ‚Äùsaid Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

He noted that digitalization gives enormous opportunities to simplify the relation of taxes, customs and other industries, where there is a meeting or any contact between a citizen and an official, a businessman and an official. Therefore, we need to seek automatic digital procedures in these areas.

There will be a reconstruction of Ukraine within the transformation, so after the victory, the country will become the largest construction site in Europe.

‚ÄúWe need to rebuild hundreds of cities and villages, thousands of infrastructure, hundreds of thousands of houses. This will give your impetus to the economy. We have to forget about our own exporter of raw materials. Victory Ukraine is a country of high cost goods. It is a country in which regulations are allowed to develop any business innovators in their fields, in their directions, and in which it is protected by intellectual property. Ukraine Victory is a country that exports security, services, experiences, culture and in general the results of intellectual activity, technological products more than any raw material, ‚Äùthe President said.

Our state will also develop cooperation and economic relations with all maklobal players, including India, Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, with China, and Ukraine's energy potential allows you to be one of Europe's energy security guarantors, in particular through the development President.

In addition, Ukraine's victory should become a country that has implemented a pension reform so that anyone who works today has decent support in the future. In this context, Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the MPs with a job to implement steps to ensure this reform.‚ÄúNow the cultural sphere requires at least a percentage of GDP a year - as a basic level for survival. But it is clear that the industry must and should be more ambitious. Ukrainian courage really awakened the enormous interest of people of the various countries in us, to us, to Ukrainians, to our cities and villages. Every such interest is opportunities, ‚Äùhe said.

According to the Head of State, Ukrainian society also requires a new policy of public space protection in cities and communities, a new museum tamemorial policy, a new policy of books and book publishers, writing, translations, translations for Ukraine foreign books and dissemination in the world of Ukrainian, Ukrainian books, and Ukrainian books. digital subscriptions, rethinking of our libraries and more.

In addition, Ukraine needs a new movie policy and film support, asvates should make films about Ukraine and Ukraine.

The Head of State also drew attention to the need for a new policy of the territories for the closest from the Russian occupation of the region. It must be its own, descended and at the same time a coherent, visionary transformation policy.

The President emphasized the internal security.

‚ÄúRussian aggression has shown what security standards are needed for life. The accessibility of shelters is maximum. School - with shelter. Hospital - with shelter. Business - with shelter. Ukrainians will trust specific things that give specific security, ‚Äùhe stressed.

In this context, there is a need to regulate the issue of weapons that will and people, demining and providing needs for its conduct, the issue of daily safety of the population, etc.

The final landmark Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the neighborhood policy.

"Strong neighborhood is always the result of very different, very deep things. Phactically successful neighborhood we can summarize any other successes of the countryside, in our region and in global relations. Economy such culture. Defense and safety. Transport and communication. Education and attitude of prehistory. Interaction between states and interaction between us, between people ... All it determines the quality of the neighborhood. Determines whether there is an understanding between neighbors, ‚Äùthe Glava of State summarized.

* The statements of Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov that during the attempt to rebellion, the whole people and the power block were with a Russian dictator, is a manipulation, as well as words that the rebellion stopped the military of the Russian Federation.

The purpose of such statements is to show the population that their leader has everything under control, and the regime is able to resolve such complex issues.

Also, such narratives are moving to strengthen the power of the President of the Russian Federation and his dictatorial regime.

It is noted that "Prozorro.Sales" will become the main site for selling Russian assets. This is an extremely important area of development of reform privatization.

This is evidenced by the interns of business to online auctions at "Prozorro.Sanes". Only during the full -scale war, Ukraine earned UAH 22.8 billion from the sale of small privatization objects.

In total, in five years, budgets of different levels have been supplemented by UAH 14 billion. Nearly five thousand state and public utilities have left the hammer. In their place, entrepreneurs have opened with novaches, such as hotels, cafes, production, and created jobs and taxes.

Sviridenko also reported that one of the first Russian assets that will be launched through "Prozorro. Soldering" can be a well -known Ocean Plaza shopping center in Kiev. Two -thirds of his shares until recently belonged to the Russian moligar, including Arcadia Rothenberg and his son Igor. In early June, the government transferred them to the State Property Fund.The State Property Fund has already re -registered corporate rights to the state. Now experts carry out inventory and actualize the statutory documents.

But in Ukraine, every chance of taking the best world experience in this direction and realized.

This was emphasized during the press conference by the Deputy Head of the Office of Economic Affairs Rostislav Shurma, reports correspondent.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, there was a very large manipulation and speculation of this fact. But what happened says that the question is probably very relevant. What was said in London? We analyze the experience and transition scenario [Economics](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy)And the entire system of CASHLESS. Now about the reaction. I can say for sure that the reaction in the hall, disinfecting a huge number of business, representatives of international politicians, was extremely positive. At the same time, I see some fears that were around this topic in our society, although it is not a solution, ‚Äùhe said.

_Video: Presidential Office_

In the belief of screws, there are several main factors that affect the fears of citizens in the introduction of such a system. The first is related to tax payments: approximately up to 60-70% of people working in the non-state sector, they are not fully paid in full.

** Read also: ** [IMF explained which reforms expected from Ukraine for the selection of tranted tranches](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3729557-mvf-poasniv-akih-reform-ocikue-vid-ukraini-dla-vidilenna-nastupnih-transiv.html)‚ÄúThis is elementary statistics. Therefore, of course, every citizen is experiencing a brow. But it is not possible to introduce Cashless sharply, at one point. This is a rather systematic comprehensive approach that will relate to dozens of reforms in other areas, including tax. Without it in the editorial we started to discuss, with a lashing reduction of tax rates,(Work - ed.)impossible. Citizens' income will fall, the economy can become uncompetitive, ‚Äù - explained the head of the head of the OP.

The second factor, according to Shurma, concerns undeclared accumulations of nopolary about their legalization: ‚ÄúCashless cannot be introduced without a complete and -capital amnesty. If we go, people who have accumulation(not important how they got them), it is necessary to give the opportunity to legalize. That is, this should be paired with tax reform. "‚ÄúWe are preparing a project with Ukrposhta, the main purpose of which will be 100% covering of Ukraine with digital banking services, as well as 100% covering of all possible selling points with modern terminals, including those who operate offline. That is, there should be full availability of all infrastructure for each citizen in all conditions, ‚Äùhe said.

At the heart of the fourth factor is directly corruption, says Shurma. The most belief, it is false that bribes have passed the sabotive form, for example, bitcoins: 99.9% of them are carried out in the form.

‚Äú99.9% of bribes, unfortunately, are still in cash. This is a fact. To the great way, we all say that we want to get rid of corruption, but when it is in charge of each of us, very often it turns out that too many citizens, business, authorities, authorities are involved in the process of undue benefit. The transition to Cashless does not give 100% guarantee I100% of elimination of corruption, but this always leaves traces, ‚ÄùShurma said.

There is currently no country that has switched to a 100% non -cash mechanism, but the successful examples that have practically done. One of them is Sweden, who went this path in about 10 years, told a representative of OP. He is aware that, given the rapid digitalization process, Ukraine has all the sakes to do so much faster and more efficiently.

‚ÄúWe can go this way not in 10 years, but at times faster. Of course, it's not one day when everything has changed. It will be a long process with systematic training, training. I think this is the following example, where we can truly take the best experience in the world, apply it in Ukraine and truly change the quality of processes within our country.

About it reports Ukrinform with reference to the national broadcaster [Err.](https://rus.err.ee/1609022024/svodka-sil-oborony-vozmozhno-nachalo-mjatezha-stalo-rezultatom-proscheta-prigozhina)According to Estonian intelligence, on June 24 towards Moscow, approximately pellet group. In doing so [Wagner's fighters]](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-pvk-vagnera)They kept various military objects: the headquarters of the Southern Military District and aerodromes in the Rostov area. The Vagnets maintained a high rate of promotion so that the defenders had at least time to prepare defense.

The beginning of the rebellion may have been the result of the calculation of the leader of the group. He could rely on the support of some warlords and the fact that the access to Moscow would be joined by parts of the regular army. The Wagner group faced weak resistance, but no one went to the side of the rebels.

For his part, Oleksandr Lukashenko offered acceptable security guarantees. The given intelligence center, Lukashenko could only be a mediator of the reverses, but long -term friendly relations between him and Prigogin had an important impact on the development of events. Lukashenko was interested in finding the solution of confidence, since his regime depends directly on the stability of the Russian Federation.

Today it is known about the trip of Prigogine to Belarus, however, as far as we know, Wagner fighters are on their bases in the occupied territories of the Ulugansk region. Probably, in the near future some "Wagner" will still move to the RB. The presence of Wagner's mercenaries in Belarus allows Lukashenkayvikosyvikosite them as instructors of special purpose units. The protective contingent can destabilize the situation in the country.

According to the final evaluation of Estonian intelligence, in the near future the actions of the "Wagnerians" will not have a significant impact on the course of war in Ukraine.

As reported by Ukrinform, the leader of the Wagner PEC [Yevgeny Prigogin, on June 23, he painted Demarsh against the Russian military leadership](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-other_news/3727120-zakolot-prigozina-vse-so-vidomo-na-cej-moment.html), in particular, against the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergiy Shoig.

On Tuesday, Lukashenko confirmed Prigogine's arrival in Belarus. Putin has stated that the Wagnerians could sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense or go to Belarus.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that the contingent of Wagner PEC will be insignificant, since more than 20,000 "Wagnerists" have already been destroyed by Ukrainian defense forces.

He told about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.

"We set up and showed a good result on team jumps. It is more difficult to jump, because you focus on yourself. Although the team is also difficult, because you think for the team. We were prevented by the weather a little, in my opinion. It is important to choose a cutting suit. Its weight is a kilogram of plus minus. This plays a very important role, because if you do not choose a good suit, then you will not be able to perform normally. It is more difficult to jump in the summer, because you are just a rhythm. In winter, you have cut a certain number of times and you have a certain definition, ‚Äùhe said.

Marusyak also noted that the quality of the jump depends on the nature of the wind. The most opinion was also influenced by the fact that athletes only take the form for the season.

The NSDC Secretary said this on the air [Radio Liberty](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-zaes-terakt-danilov-pidhotovka/32484147.html), reports Ukrinform.

‚ÄúWe have our protocols, our plans, how we have to act.

He noted that it is difficult to say about the possible consequences of extraordinary confidence at the ZPP.

‚ÄúThe very fact that these terrorists carry out such a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility will consider all civilized countries that this is the use of nuclear weapons to protect civilians. Therefore, we will watch very carefully - if it is not daibog it will happen - what will be the reaction of the world to these events. Unfortunately, what happened recently in the blasting of the dam, the world's response did not correspond to the terrorist attack that Ukraine suffered. We are doing everything possible now that this does not happen, but the station is now in the hands of terrorists, ‚Äùthe NSDC secretary said.

Commenting on the likelihood of committing a terrorist attack at the ZPP, the Secretary of the National Security Service has become difficult to say now, since "these people are not predictable, they act outside any rules and rules of the world community."

About it [reported](https://www.facebook.com/office.ombudsman.ua/posts/pfbid0R5RmyWhbKP1zQobYR8MjfAf9qMLDR4S1QdfLkhE3TAPusXHcJ6iYWTZMGHY6jjsXl)Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets.

‚ÄúWe strongly recommend - not to interact with representatives of the Russian Federation, not to inform the personal data of Ukrainian citizens and not to violate the Law of Ukraine‚Äú Personal data ‚Äù. It is quite obvious that after their collection, Russia can spread another manipulation and harm those who are now the users, ‚Äùthe message reads.

Dmitry Lubinets stressed that according to the Geneva Convention that the Vorozhivza should not be captured/hostage to civilians, but the Russian Federation had already destroyed this rule.

Currently, in order to return civilian Ukrainians, the state is developing mechanisms, involves international representatives and organizations, and tests a variety of options for verification and return of our citizens.

‚ÄúThe only obstacle to their return remains the Russian Federation. However, everything will not change and every Ukrainian will return home, ‚Äùthe presentation reads.

With honor, we remember our soldiers, who lay down on the snake - next to the ruins of the temple legendary Achilles, the place of bloody battles, the island of stone power of the willpower.

Glory to Ukraine!

He urged to increase cooperation in the investigation and judicial prosecution of Russian crimes against the environment at the international level. He also stressed that it was necessary to make the aggressor pay for the tremendous damage caused to these.

The report also stated that about 30% of the territory of Ukraine - 174 km km - is polluted by explosive objects. More than 2.4 million hectares of forests have been damaged. The recent attack on the Kakhovskaya HPP dam has led to the largest environmental catastrophe in Ukraine since Chornobyl. And this list is not final, because intense fighting is ongoing.

‚ÄúThe attitude towards the" Wagnerians "on the Ukrainian Front has changed radically.

"However, the Kremlin regime received the strongest blow to the Suppilla, which became the first practical stage of dismantling the Putin system," the institution was recalled.

As it was reported, the leader of the Wagner PEC Yevgeny Prigogin announced Demarsh against the Russian military leadership, in particular against the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergey Shoig.

** _ When will Putin come before a criminal court for his crimes? Questions as many in Ukraine and the world ._ **

-This is a matter of political and legal ... The first-I believe in it. Moreover, I am genuine that as a result of the joint work of our military, our partners, politicians, lawyers, representatives of the public, it will still be observed on the basic principles of criminal law - the principle of inevitability of punishment.

Another thing, how to provide it? Will the International Criminal Court help us here(MKS)? As it will be possible to realize that presidential warrant for the arrest of the President of the RFPutin.

The International Criminal Court was created by signing the Roman Status to ensure that military criminals are held accountable.

Indeed, on March 14, the ISS issued such a warrant. Before that, a certain procedure was carried out: initially the prosecutor initiated this investigation in accordance with the Drimean Statute. Then, in literally for several days, 41 countries have displayed his appeal, and it was also an independent basis for investigation, - says in an interview [Armyinform](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/)Director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Scientific and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Doctoral Sciences, Professor Alexei Kot.

In 2013-2014, Ukraine allowed the ISS investigation into its metrics of military crimes and crimes against humanity that could occur during the revolution of dignity, annexation of Crimea and the resolution of war in the Donbass. However, the problem is that in accordance with the Rome Statute, in the Abbodia - that is, in absentia criminal proceedings is not allowed.Putin has the so -called presidential immunity. The UN International Court of Justice clearly consumed that national courts have no jurisdiction over higher officials of foreign states. The head of state, the head of government and the Minister of Foreign Patients shall make the so -called "three", which is endowed with personal immunity of Ratiopersonae.

How can it be bypassing? Through the creation of international special tribunals. There are several varieties of these tribunals and some practitioners have already been developed.

‚ÄúThe attitude towards the Wagnets on the Ukrainian Front has changed radically. The congratulations of Western intelligence, with Prigogin to Belarus, have left no more than a thousand Wagnerians, while others are forced to enter into contracts with the Ministry of Defense. The physical elimination of the "Wagnets" began to the occupied territories of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya regions from June 25. From them, they create individual assault detachments of "suicide bombers" and send the positions repelled by the Russians. Even if the assaults were successful, these positions are "covered" from the artillery of the Russian army. According to preliminary data, only the loss of the loss from this "approach" exceeded 50 people, " - the testimony reads.

According to the CPD, the "stripping" of the internal support of Wagner is accompanied by the Kremlin's novels under the control of the "Prigogine Empire" in Africa and the Close East.

The department states: ‚ÄúOf course, Russia cannot give up such a lever in Africa as Wagner PEC. Therefore, the only way out for the Kremlin is the company with the appointment of new heads. Representatives of the Russian MZS have already warned the leaders of African countries that the Wagner PEC will continue their activity, but under new leadership. And one of the Deputy Ministers of the Russian Federation personally informed Syria President B. Asad that the PVC units will no longer operate on their own. Moreover, in the presence of information, the Russian military police detained the head of the Wagner PEC in Es-Suvide, in the south of Syria, and three high-ranking commanders of PEC Naviabaz Khmeimim.
