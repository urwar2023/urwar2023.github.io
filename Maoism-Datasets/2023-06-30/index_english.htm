He stated this by presenting the benchmarks of the future document with the Polyar Session of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of the Constitution Day of Ukraine. About it <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/volodimir-zelenskij-zaproponuvav-osnovni-napryami-transforma-83905">reports</a>The official website of the President of Ukraine.</p>
<p>"We have to go during this time such a path that other peoples have overcome for decades. Ukraine will have special attention, special trust in the world, and every manifestation of attention and trust should be focused on the development of Ukraine and all aspects in our country," the president stressed.</p>
<p>The first specific purpose for Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the GDP's achievement in a trillion dollars, and the potential of our country is able to suggest.</p>
<p>The second point is the rejection of the idea, as if the cheap work of Ukrainians is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>"We aim to reach such a level of remuneration that could be brought to the formula" neighbors in the European Union plus 30%. " This is a fair goal, a war of war. Ukraine of victory will be a bet on qualified work. Aotge, for education, ”the Head of State said.</p>
<p>The President also emphasized the need to spread English, because it is a language of global cooperation, business, and science of taglobal communication.</p>
<p>The third crucial task, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, identified the return of the home of a large number of our citizens who went beyond the state. It is necessary to create as many jobs as possible.</p>
<p>"The transformation of every sector of the economy, any social practice and all spheres of public administration should answer the question: how many new workplace will give Ukraine a specific decision, a specific initiative," he said.</p>
<p>The President also advocated the formation of a new policy of support of paternity. According to the head of state, the second and third child in the family should be happiness, not restriction of opportunities.</p>
<p>To help families, a special application "Dream" will be created, which will support everything concerning parents and children: services that are needed for children, the child for development, education, security, contact with the state, etc. The digital transformation team of Ukraine will present the application in the fall, Vladimir Zelensky reported.“Everyone who creates new jobs in Ukraine creates the basis for economic leadership of Ukraine. Ukraine of victory will protect every person's ability to work as much and as a person desires. We need to summarize the labor legislation, ”he said.</p>
<p>The seventh point of transformation of the state, according to the President, has a stalkin rational tax agreement between the state and society and the real -alienation of property.</p>
<p>“I am a supporter of tax reductions. But now, during such a war and the obvious dependence of Ukraine on cooperation with financial donors, we cannot allow ourselves to reduce taxes. But when Ukraine of victory itself becomes a member for the world, our level of opportunity will be higher. Reduced taxes have to determine the increased tax honesty, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>He noted that digitalization gives enormous opportunities to simplify the relation of taxes, customs and other industries, where there is a meeting or any contact between a citizen and an official, a businessman and an official. Therefore, we need to seek automatic digital procedures in these areas.</p>
<p>There will be a reconstruction of Ukraine within the transformation, so after the victory, the country will become the largest construction site in Europe.</p>
<p>“We need to rebuild hundreds of cities and villages, thousands of infrastructure, hundreds of thousands of houses. This will give your impetus to the economy. We have to forget about our own exporter of raw materials. Victory Ukraine is a country of high cost goods. It is a country in which regulations are allowed to develop any business innovators in their fields, in their directions, and in which it is protected by intellectual property. Ukraine Victory is a country that exports security, services, experiences, culture and in general the results of intellectual activity, technological products more than any raw material, ”the President said.</p>
<p>Our state will also develop cooperation and economic relations with all maklobal players, including India, Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, with China, and Ukraine's energy potential allows you to be one of Europe's energy security guarantors, in particular through the development President.</p>
<p>In addition, Ukraine's victory should become a country that has implemented a pension reform so that anyone who works today has decent support in the future.

<p>Як свідчать матеріали слідства, екскерівник Миколаївської окружної прокуратуриспівпрацював із представниками силових структур рф. Для цього використовувавпосередника, щоб «відвести сліди від себе».</p>
<p>За наявними даними, він передавав інформацію про:</p>
<ul>
<li>оперативну обстановку у Миколаєві та області;  * загиблих військових і цивільних осіб, полонених, місця їх утримання;  * результати обстрілів Миколаєва;  * добові паролі на блокпости на території області тощо.</li>
</ul>
<p>Щоб задокументувати зрадника, СБУ провела спецоперацію, в тому числі зімітації злочину. Через підставну особу українська спецслужба передалафігуранту імітовані списки загиблих військовослужбовців ЗСУ. Через декількаднів ці списки уже було зафіксовано у представника РФ, за яким також стежилаСБУ.</p>
<p>У результаті обшуків у фігуранта вилучено мобільний телефон, комп’ютернутехніку та флеш-носії, які містять докази його протиправної діяльності.</p>
<p>Наразі суд призначив йому покарання — довічне позбавлення волі з конфіскацієюмайна.</p>

<p>This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at a press conference according to the results(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz)In Brussels, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“It's terribly difficult. No one knows what and how to do. We gave the European Commission to break our heads and inform us after they have any results, ”the chancellor said.</p>
<p>He noted that there is no "mature" proposal on how to change the current framework, many questions are open, there are a large number of "legal and actual" challenges that need to be carefully studied the path that is not easy and may take a long time. The partners are at the beginning of the debate on the mobilization of financial resources, the politician added.</p>

<p>Німецький канцлер загалом запевнив, що партнери «європейсько ітрансатлантично» міцно стоять на боці України. Єдність буде засвідчена такожпід час саміту НАТО в липні, додав він.</p>

But in Ukraine, every chance of taking the best world experience in this direction and realized.</p>
<p>This was emphasized during the press conference by the Deputy Head of the Office of Economic Affairs Rostislav Shurma, reports correspondent.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there was a very large manipulation and speculation of this fact. But what happened says that the question is probably very relevant. What was said in London? We analyze the experience and transition scenario <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy">Economics</a>And the entire system of CASHLESS. Now about the reaction. I can say for sure that the reaction in the hall, disinfecting a huge number of business, representatives of international politicians, was extremely positive. At the same time, I see some fears that were around this topic in our society, although it is not a solution, ”he said.</p>
<p><em>Video: Presidential Office</em></p>
<p>In the belief of screws, there are several main factors that affect the fears of citizens in the introduction of such a system. The first is related to tax payments: approximately up to 60-70% of people working in the non-state sector, they are not fully paid in full.</p>
<p><strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3729557-mvf-poasniv-akih-reform-ocikue-vid-ukraini-dla-vidilenna-nastupnih-transiv.html">IMF explained which reforms expected from Ukraine for the selection of tranted tranches</a>“This is elementary statistics. Therefore, of course, every citizen is experiencing a brow. But it is not possible to introduce Cashless sharply, at one point. This is a rather systematic comprehensive approach that will relate to dozens of reforms in other areas, including tax. Without it in the editorial we started to discuss, with a lashing reduction of tax rates,(Work - ed.)impossible. Citizens' income will fall, the economy can become uncompetitive, ” - explained the head of the head of the OP.</p>
<p>The second factor, according to Shurma, concerns undeclared accumulations of nopolary about their legalization: “Cashless cannot be introduced without a complete and -capital amnesty. If we go, people who have accumulation(not important how they got them), it is necessary to give the opportunity to legalize. That is, this should be paired with tax reform. "“We are preparing a project with Ukrposhta, the main purpose of which will be 100% covering of Ukraine with digital banking services, as well as 100% covering of all possible selling points with modern terminals, including those who operate offline. That is, there should be full availability of all infrastructure for each citizen in all conditions, ”he said.</p>
<p>At the heart of the fourth factor is directly corruption, says Shurma. The most belief, it is false that bribes have passed the sabotive form, for example, bitcoins: 99.9% of them are carried out in the form.</p>
<p>“99.9% of bribes, unfortunately, are still in cash. This is a fact. To the great way, we all say that we want to get rid of corruption, but when it is in charge of each of us, very often it turns out that too many citizens, business, authorities, authorities are involved in the process of undue benefit. The transition to Cashless does not give 100% guarantee I100% of elimination of corruption, but this always leaves traces, ”Shurma said.</p>
<p>There is currently no country that has switched to a 100% non -cash mechanism, but the successful examples that have practically done. One of them is Sweden, who went this path in about 10 years, told a representative of OP. He is aware that, given the rapid digitalization process, Ukraine has all the sakes to do so much faster and more efficiently.</p>
<p>“We can go this way not in 10 years, but at times faster. Of course, it's not one day when everything has changed. It will be a long process with systematic training, training. I think this is the following example, where we can truly take the best experience in the world, apply it in Ukraine and truly change the quality of processes within our country.</p>

<p>About it reports Ukrinform with reference to the national broadcaster <a href="https://rus.err.ee/1609022024/svodka-sil-oborony-vozmozhno-nachalo-mjatezha-stalo-rezultatom-proscheta-prigozhina">Err.</a>According to Estonian intelligence, on June 24 towards Moscow, approximately pellet group. In doing so [Wagner's fighters]](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-pvk-vagnera)They kept various military objects: the headquarters of the Southern Military District and aerodromes in the Rostov area. The Vagnets maintained a high rate of promotion so that the defenders had at least time to prepare defense.</p>
<p>The beginning of the rebellion may have been the result of the calculation of the leader of the group. He could rely on the support of some warlords and the fact that the access to Moscow would be joined by parts of the regular army. The Wagner group faced weak resistance, but no one went to the side of the rebels.</p>
<p>For his part, Oleksandr Lukashenko offered acceptable security guarantees. The given intelligence center, Lukashenko could only be a mediator of the reverses, but long -term friendly relations between him and Prigogin had an important impact on the development of events. Lukashenko was interested in finding the solution of confidence, since his regime depends directly on the stability of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Today it is known about the trip of Prigogine to Belarus, however, as far as we know, Wagner fighters are on their bases in the occupied territories of the Ulugansk region. Probably, in the near future some "Wagner" will still move to the RB. The presence of Wagner's mercenaries in Belarus allows Lukashenkayvikosyvikosite them as instructors of special purpose units. The protective contingent can destabilize the situation in the country.</p>

<p>According to the final evaluation of Estonian intelligence, in the near future the actions of the "Wagnerians" will not have a significant impact on the course of war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, the leader of the Wagner PEC <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-other_news/3727120-zakolot-prigozina-vse-so-vidomo-na-cej-moment.html">Yevgeny Prigogin, on June 23, he painted Demarsh against the Russian military leadership</a>, in particular, against the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergiy Shoig.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lukashenko confirmed Prigogine's arrival in Belarus. Putin has stated that the Wagnerians could sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense or go to Belarus.</p>
<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced that the contingent of Wagner PEC will be insignificant, since more than 20,000 "Wagnerists" have already been destroyed by Ukrainian defense forces.</p>

<p>This opinion was expressed in a comment by Ukrinform on Friday, June 30.</p>
<p>"There will be no changes in politics from Kadin, as long as Putin.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Chechnya's head will never go to betray <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin">Putin</a>, and the pause during the attempt by the rebellious Prishozhin was caused by the fact that Kadyrov did not know how to act, because he did not receive a "Kremlin".</p>
<p>"He was not involved in this special operation(Wagner PVC - Ed.), so I waited. Sometimes him(Head of Rosgvardia - ed.)Zolotov gave a "dash", he rejected and said he was sending his units("In the area of tension" -ed.). Він виключно сателіт, піхотинець Путіна, і ніякого іншого "даху" внього немає", - зазначив Закаєв.</p>

<p>"No, absolutely!He doesn't need anything. He knows that he has, he has Chechnya. As soon as he finds himself outside Chechnya, he is no one, and there he is king Ibog. Therefore, he is satisfied with this territory," he says Prime Minister of the Government of the Republic of Ichkeria.</p>

<p>Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov, June 24, stated that the actions of the "Wagner" leader Eugene Prigogine is "betrayal", "knife in the back" and "real military rebellion". He added that his militants had already left "in the tension zones" and ready to assist the Ministry of Defense To suppress Prigogine's rebellion.On Tuesday, June 27, Lukashenko confirmed the arrival of Prigogine in Belarus. Lukashenko already stated that he wanted the Wagner PVC militants to pass on their fighting experience to the Belarusian army.</p>

<p>He told about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>"We set up and showed a good result on team jumps. It is more difficult to jump, because you focus on yourself. Although the team is also difficult, because you think for the team. We were prevented by the weather a little, in my opinion. It is important to choose a cutting suit. Its weight is a kilogram of plus minus. This plays a very important role, because if you do not choose a good suit, then you will not be able to perform normally. It is more difficult to jump in the summer, because you are just a rhythm. In winter, you have cut a certain number of times and you have a certain definition, ”he said.</p>
<p>Marusyak also noted that the quality of the jump depends on the nature of the wind. The most opinion was also influenced by the fact that athletes only take the form for the season.</p>

<p>According to Krasovitsky, Ukrainians began to read less <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kniga">books</a>from psychology, medical and educational literature. In Ukraine, he added, now there are very few writers of mass literature that Ukrainians also need.</p>
<p>"We have the writers of the mass genre on the fingers of one -handed ... , science fiction. Units, and many of them have been working as Naproian publishers, because Ukrainian publishers could not promote, " - said.</p>

<p><strong> _ When will Putin come before a criminal court for his crimes? Questions as many in Ukraine and the world ._ </strong></p>
<p>-This is a matter of political and legal ... The first-I believe in it. Moreover, I am genuine that as a result of the joint work of our military, our partners, politicians, lawyers, representatives of the public, it will still be observed on the basic principles of criminal law - the principle of inevitability of punishment.</p>
<p>Another thing, how to provide it? Will the International Criminal Court help us here(MKS)? As it will be possible to realize that presidential warrant for the arrest of the President of the RFPutin.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court was created by signing the Roman Status to ensure that military criminals are held accountable.</p>
<p>Indeed, on March 14, the ISS issued such a warrant. Before that, a certain procedure was carried out: initially the prosecutor initiated this investigation in accordance with the Drimean Statute. Then, in literally for several days, 41 countries have displayed his appeal, and it was also an independent basis for investigation, - says in an interview <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/">Armyinform</a>Director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Scientific and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Doctoral Sciences, Professor Alexei Kot.</p>
<p>In 2013-2014, Ukraine allowed the ISS investigation into its metrics of military crimes and crimes against humanity that could occur during the revolution of dignity, annexation of Crimea and the resolution of war in the Donbass. However, the problem is that in accordance with the Rome Statute, in the Abbodia - that is, in absentia criminal proceedings is not allowed.Putin has the so -called presidential immunity. The UN International Court of Justice clearly consumed that national courts have no jurisdiction over higher officials of foreign states. The head of state, the head of government and the Minister of Foreign Patients shall make the so -called "three", which is endowed with personal immunity of Ratiopersonae.</p>
<p>How can it be bypassing? Through the creation of international special tribunals. There are several varieties of these tribunals and some practitioners have already been developed.</p>

<p>“The attitude towards the Wagnets on the Ukrainian Front has changed radically. The congratulations of Western intelligence, with Prigogin to Belarus, have left no more than a thousand Wagnerians, while others are forced to enter into contracts with the Ministry of Defense. The physical elimination of the "Wagnets" began to the occupied territories of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya regions from June 25. From them, they create individual assault detachments of "suicide bombers" and send the positions repelled by the Russians. Even if the assaults were successful, these positions are "covered" from the artillery of the Russian army. According to preliminary data, only the loss of the loss from this "approach" exceeded 50 people, " - the testimony reads.</p>
<p>According to the CPD, the "stripping" of the internal support of Wagner is accompanied by the Kremlin's novels under the control of the "Prigogine Empire" in Africa and the Close East.</p>
<p>The department states: “Of course, Russia cannot give up such a lever in Africa as Wagner PEC. Therefore, the only way out for the Kremlin is the company with the appointment of new heads. Representatives of the Russian MZS have already warned the leaders of African countries that the Wagner PEC will continue their activity, but under new leadership. And one of the Deputy Ministers of the Russian Federation personally informed Syria President B. Asad that the PVC units will no longer operate on their own. Moreover, in the presence of information, the Russian military police detained the head of the Wagner PEC in Es-Suvide, in the south of Syria, and three high-ranking commanders of PEC Naviabaz Khmeimim.</p>
