 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the opening of the IV Summit of the Radiyepa in Reykjavik.
Ukrinform provides the full text of the presidential speech, published Office of the Head of State.
_ Thank you very much! _
Ms. Prime Minister Jacobsdottir, dear Katrin, thank you for inviting the participation at the Summit of our Council of Europe and for your sincere desire to help Ukraine.
Dear leaders of Europe! 
Today, Ukraine has passed because of a very complicated challenge - an intense Russian -currency attack. It is in such challenges that we are all now forced to pay attention.
At three o'clock in the morning our people woke up from the explosions. 18 Russian rocket launchers were in our sky, including ballistic missiles, which the terrorist state boasted. Like, they are guaranteed to bear death because they are allegedly knocked down.
Russia applied at the same time balistics, winged rockets, drones ... Especially it was especially difficult for the other defenders of the sky to protect people's lives. But all the lives were protected - all rockets were knocked down, including ballistic. One hundred percent. This is a historical result. Thank you all!
Russia is very trying to improve its ability to kill. We are very trying to improve the protection of our people. I thank all the countries and leaders that work out for us to improve our air defense!We all show that Takenashi with you one hundred percent, what is the power of the free world.
And, of course, I thank each of our soldiers who do this work in our land and on our land, and especially I thank everyone who trains our warriors of cross -out training missions, which are all similar in one - in success. Thank you all!Thank you all!
A year ago, we could not knock down most terrorists, and specialty. And I ask: if we were able to do it, then there is something we can't when we are united and tuned to protect life? Answer: We are one hundred percent in any field, when the goal is to protect our people of Nasha Europe.
Of course, there is a lot to do. The territory of Ukraine is significant, and that such a result of air defense, like this night, be a rule throughout the territory, requires specialty air defense systems and missiles. Modern fighters are also needed, without which the air defense system will not be perfect. I'm sure we'll come to this.
One hundred percent should be a benchmark for us. We have zero percent to leave the aggressor!One hundred percent of the success of sanctions - it is guaranteed by honesty in the policy of each state. Thank you to everyone who treats the fight against terror - honestly!
One hundred percent of the success of our peace formula - it is guaranteed by diplomacy. Thank you who helps us to unite the world to implement the formula of peace - the only realistic peace plan!
But, of course, one hundred percent of justice - there is no reliable peace of rationality.
Thank you to the Council of Europe - each of you personally!- for the decision on the register of losses caused by Russia's aggression. This brings the creation of a full -fledged compensation mechanism that will show the world that aggression does not even think of thinking.
There should also be a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, so that the terror is answered in whose heads this terror is born. I am sure that we will give this result for one hundred percent.
Europe expected such a time - a time when leaders for the sake of protecting Europe, for the sake of our common values with you, would have been in one hundred percent unity and ascetic percent results.
That's what we achieve!Ukraine and all of Europe. Everyone and everyone who is now this summit and who helps us.
We are Europeans, and therefore we are free. We are Europeans, and therefore we value peace. We are Europeans, and therefore, we act on one hundred percent of our forces when you need to protect your lifestyle. Let it be the rules for our continent forever!
Thank you for your support! 
Glory to Ukraine! 
_ Glory to all of Europe!_

I am very grateful for our unity in protecting peace and in promotion of ideocracy. This is the reason from which the Council of Europe was formed, Isama has gathered us today. While Russia continues its war on democracy itself, Europe is the only one and it stands for Ukraine. This is a duty, ”the President of the European Commission emphasized.
She recalled the words of the Sakharov Prize laureate Alexandra Matviychuk, who was lying to Ukraine not because he was afraid of NATO, but in order to suppress the movement of Ukraine to democracy. That is why this war, which Russia has solved against Ukraine, is a war of values. Therefore, Europe has to take on the responsibility of the slavery of democracy.
“It is very true that the people of Ukraine requires responsibility for Russian crimes: for shelling of civilian homes, for cold -blooded executions, the suspension of children. More than 19,000 children were stolen and removed from their own years. This is exactly what this summit in Iceland should focus on, ”Ursula Der Lyen said.

This is our joint struggle, and we will stand on their Botthat for a long time. Glory to Ukraine!, Let Europe live!”, The President of the European Commission has written her speech.

More than 19,000 children were stolen and removed from their own years. This is exactly what this summit in Iceland should focus on, ”Ursula Der Lyen said.

This is our joint struggle, and we will stand on their Botthat for a long time. Glory to Ukraine!, Let Europe live!”, The President of the European Commission has written her speech.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the opening of the IV Summit of the Council of Europe Urakyavik.
Ukrinform provides the full text of the presidential speech, published Office of the Head of State.
_ Thank you very much! _
Ms. Prime Minister Jacobsdottir, dear Katrin, thank you for inviting the participation at the Summit of our Council of Europe and for your sincere desire to help Ukraine.
Dear leaders of Europe! 
Today, Ukraine has passed because of a very complicated challenge - an intense Russian -currency attack. It is in such challenges that we are all now forced to pay attention.
At three o'clock in the morning our people woke up from the explosions. 18 Russian rocket launchers were in our sky, including ballistic missiles, which the terrorist state boasted. Like, they are guaranteed to bear death because they are allegedly knocked down.
Russia applied at the same time balistics, winged rockets, drones ... Especially it was especially difficult for the other defenders of the sky to protect people's lives. But all the lives were protected - all rockets were knocked down, including ballistic. One hundred percent. This is a historical result. Thank you all!
Russia is very trying to improve its ability to kill. We are very trying to improve the protection of our people. I thank all the countries and leaders that work out for us to improve our air defense!We all show that Takenashi with you one hundred percent, what is the power of the free world.
And, of course, I thank each of our soldiers who do this work in our land and on our land, and especially I thank everyone who trains our warriors of cross -out training missions, which are all similar in one - in success. Thank you all!Thank you all!
A year ago, we could not knock down most terrorists, and specialty. And I ask: if we were able to do it, then there is something we can't when we are united and tuned to protect life? Answer: We are one hundred percent in any field, when the goal is to protect our people of Nasha Europe.
Of course, there is a lot to do. The territory of Ukraine is significant, and that such a result of air defense, like this night, be a rule throughout the territory, requires specialty air defense systems and missiles. Modern fighters are also needed, without which the air defense system will not be perfect. I'm sure we'll come to this.
One hundred percent should be a benchmark for us. We have zero percent to leave the aggressor!One hundred percent of the success of sanctions - it is guaranteed by honesty in the policy of each state. Thank you to everyone who treats the fight against terror - honestly!
One hundred percent of the success of our peace formula - it is guaranteed by diplomacy. Thank you who helps us to unite the world to implement the formula of peace - the only realistic peace plan!
But, of course, one hundred percent of justice - there is no reliable peace of rationality.
Thank you to the Council of Europe - each of you personally!- for the decision on the register of losses caused by Russia's aggression. This brings the creation of a full -fledged compensation mechanism that will show the world that aggression does not even think of thinking.
There should also be a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, so that the terror is answered in whose heads this terror is born. I am sure that we will give this result for one hundred percent.
Europe expected such a time - a time when leaders for the sake of protecting Europe, for the sake of our common values with you, would have been in one hundred percent unity and ascetic percent results.
That's what we achieve!Ukraine and all of Europe. Everyone and everyone who is now this summit and who helps us.
We are Europeans, and therefore we are free. We are Europeans, and therefore we value peace. We are Europeans, and therefore, we act on one hundred percent of our forces when you need to protect your lifestyle. Let it be the rules for our continent forever!
Thank you for your support! 
Glory to Ukraine! 
_ Glory to all of Europe!_

"If someone believes that Russia should stay in the same form in which it is a Blado of War, after our victory, then the question of activation of Russian swinging, imperialism," said Alexei Danilov, adding that then RFProtrotag will succeed in aggression about aggression another country.

 The aggressor state of Russia forcibly exports civilian population from the occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, including the staff of the captured AAP in Energodar.
“It is about people who either deliberately worked on the aggressor or were forced to do. They are told that hostilities will soon begin, that this territory will be fired and bombed, so they will convince and work with the Russians, ”said Andrey Chernyak, a representative of the RBC-Ukraine.
According to a representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the so-called evacuation of the packed territories of southern Ukraine, Russians use as a screen to carry counterintelligence and filtration measures: “They, first, are bad that the population can observe their preparation for battles-that is, certain counterintelligence measures. It is also filtration, because, first of all, there is a forced export of the pro -Ukrainian population. And thirdly, the Russians are afraid of holding in these territories of some guerrilla movement and internal resistance, ”Andrey Chernyak said.
At the same time a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the removal of Russian combat units from Zaporizhzhya, or from the Kherson regions, is not being recorded. In the occupied territories of these two regions, there are now approximately 152 thousand personnel of enemy troops, and all their actions indicate that they are preparing a pre -defense.

The rules of work and staying on the facility or not less for the employees are becoming more tougher.
“After a recently entered ban on using even a button phone, Russian terrorists are introduced to personnel by more restrictions for personnel.
Before the working change, the guards are carefully and carefully inspected the staff at the entrance, allowing them to pass to the workplaces exclusively by the trestle.
Under the harsh taboo and any movement of the territory of the ZPP, except those that were clearly defined by "local police". To go beyond the station is strictly forbidden.
While at work, employees now have the right to look only directly by the front. To turn your head and even just look away - it is strictly forbidden, ”the message goes.
