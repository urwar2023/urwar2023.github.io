About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/SZRUkraine/posts/pfbid0YcMM33NjWTADpNDtAnAH812q75yYhvmSKaBpEtXdGf5BSAsLkn6LQraLvFjXBduXl)External Intelligence Service of Ukraine.

“According to the BEROC Academic Research Center, the proportion of savings of Belarusians has decreased to 11.5 %. The main reason is the understanding of people that the situation in the economy is not too good. In order to stimulate the money to give money to banks for a long period, it is necessary to significantly positive in real expressing rates that are not even in rubles. Situation in foreign currency deposits is even worse, the rates behind it are even lower than dollar inflation. Last year, a study on the orderbank's order showed that, depending on the region, 20-30 % of people have accumulations for no more than one month, ”the message reads.

It is significant that according to Belstat, in April 2023, the prices of more than 30.55 %increased the largest, 28.59 %for cigarettes, and 27.35 %for the services of international torture.

“During the meeting in Paris, on May 14, 2023, the Presidents of Ukraine of the Tarhntzu Republic made such a statement.

Presidents of Ukraine and France once again declared their unambiguous condemnation of continued military aggression of Russia against Ukraine. Ukraine demonstrates the extraordinary determination in exercising its inalienable right to self -defense of a discontinuous and unjustified attack.

Protecting the safety of the European continent, France, Ukraine and other partners also protect the international order based on the rules.In addition to military assistance, the French Republic provided a civilian assistance to Ukraine, including financial, humanitarian and emergency support.

Ukraine and France are set to fight impunity and emphasize their confinement to hold persons responsible for military and other cruel crimes committed in connection with military aggression against Ukraine. France is involved in current international efforts with Ukraine to ensure responsibility through the creation of a corresponding mechanism for investigating the crime of aggression. Wide international support is key in this respect because it provides maximum international legitimacy, while providing the judicial persecution of political leadership. Therefore, by participating in the main group of achieving the responsibility of aggression against Ukraine, France encourages other countries to join and increase international support for the creation of an AD hoctbuon.

_**Thank you very much!** _

Ms. Prime Minister Jacobsdottir, dear Katrin, thank you for inviting the participation at the Summit of our Council of Europe and for your sincere desire to help Ukraine.

_Dear leaders of Europe!_

Today, Ukraine has passed because of a very complicated challenge - an intense Russian -currency attack. It is in such challenges that we are all now forced to pay attention.

At three o'clock in the morning our people woke up from the explosions. 18 Russian rocket launchers were in our sky, including ballistic missiles, which the terrorist state boasted. Like, they are guaranteed to bear death because they are allegedly knocked down.

Russia applied at the same time balistics, winged rockets, drones ... Especially it was especially difficult for the other defenders of the sky to protect people's lives. But all the lives were protected - all rockets were knocked down, including ballistic. One hundred percent. This is a historical result. Thank you all!

Russia is very trying to improve its ability to kill. We are very trying to improve the protection of our people. I thank all the countries and leaders that work out for us to improve our air defense!We all show that Takenashi with you one hundred percent, what is the power of the free world.

And, of course, I thank each of our soldiers who do this work in our land and on our land, and especially I thank everyone who trains our warriors of cross -out training missions, which are all similar in one - in success. Thank you all!Thank you all!

A year ago, we could not knock down most terrorists, and specialty. And I ask: if we were able to do it, then there is something we can't when we are united and tuned to protect life? Answer: We are one hundred percent in any field, when the goal is to protect our people of Nasha Europe.

Of course, there is a lot to do. The territory of Ukraine is significant, and that such a result of air defense, like this night, be a rule throughout the territory, requires specialty air defense systems and missiles. Modern fighters are also needed, without which the air defense system will not be perfect. I'm sure we'll come to this.

One hundred percent should be a benchmark for us. We have zero percent to leave the aggressor!One hundred percent of the success of sanctions - it is guaranteed by honesty in the policy of each state. Thank you to everyone who treats the fight against terror - honestly!

One hundred percent of the success of our peace formula - it is guaranteed by diplomacy. Thank you who helps us to unite the world to implement the formula of peace - the only realistic peace plan!

But, of course, one hundred percent of justice - there is no reliable peace of rationality.

Thank you to the Council of Europe - each of you personally!- for the decision on the register of losses caused by Russia's aggression. This brings the creation of a full -fledged compensation mechanism that will show the world that aggression does not even think of thinking.

There should also be a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, so that the terror is answered in whose heads this terror is born. I am sure that we will give this result for one hundred percent.

Europe expected such a time - a time when leaders for the sake of protecting Europe, for the sake of our common values with you, would have been in one hundred percent unity and ascetic percent results.

That's what we achieve!Ukraine and all of Europe. Everyone and everyone who is now this summit and who helps us.

We are Europeans, and therefore we are free. We are Europeans, and therefore we value peace. We are Europeans, and therefore, we act on one hundred percent of our forces when you need to protect your lifestyle. Let it be the rules for our continent forever!

**_Thank you for your support!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

** _ Glory to all of Europe!_ **

This was announced today during a speech at the Council of Europe Summit in the capital of Iceland, Reykjavik, President of the European Commission Ursula von Der Lyen said, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Today the war has returned to [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evropa)… .Ukraine is fighting for the values that we believe in both we are and which are so exterminated for us. I am very grateful for our unity in protecting peace and in promotion of ideocracy. This is the reason from which the Council of Europe was formed, Isama has gathered us today. While Russia continues its war on democracy itself, Europe is the only one and it stands for Ukraine. This is a duty, ”the President of the European Commission emphasized.

She recalled the words of the Sakharov Prize laureate Alexandra Matviychuk, who was lying to Ukraine not because he was afraid of NATO, but in order to suppress the movement of Ukraine to democracy. That is why this war, which Russia has solved against Ukraine, is a war of values. Therefore, Europe has to take on the responsibility of the slavery of democracy.

“It is very true that the people of Ukraine requires responsibility for Russian crimes: for shelling of civilian homes, for cold -blooded executions, the suspension of children. More than 19,000 children were stolen and removed from their own years. This is exactly what this summit in Iceland should focus on, ”Ursula Der Lyen said.

She noted that such attention is important for Ukrainians, since the prospective reversal responsibility can now keep Russian soldiers the export of new military crimes. But it is also important for the future. Therefore, only justice can be the basis for a long peace in Ukraine, just peace.

The President of the European Commission emphasized - since the creation of the Council of Europe, the continent has been heading for democracy. Europeans rebuilt not only their cities, they resumed the moral foundations of Europe, placed freedom, equality of tasolidarity in the heart of European society.** Read also: ** [** SHOLC **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3710186-solc-vijna-z-rosieu-ne-zaversitsa-peremogou-putinskogo-imperializmu.html)She noted that today Europe again confirms loyalty to its values.

“We will do our best to win peace, just peace. We will do nothing for Ukraine without Ukraine. That is why we strongly support the Ukrainian formula of peace, which is the basis of the path to peace. I call us at this summit to support this peace formula. The test is coming. It is very important that we combine forces. Ukrainians are struggling with suicide and for freedom. This is our joint struggle, and we will stand on their Botthat for a long time. Glory to Ukraine!, Let Europe live!”, The President of the European Commission has written her speech.

As it was reported, the Sumith of the Council of Europe is taking place today in Reykjavik, whose participants consider the most important global problems and issues of international relations, including the consequences of Russia's military aggression anti -Ukraine and the search for ways to just peace.

This belief was expressed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz in his speech on the Samotirad of Europe in Reykjavik, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“One day Russian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna)It will end. One thing is that it will not end with the victory of Putin's imperialism. We will support Ukraine until the justice is reached, ”Scholt said.

One of the main lessons that Europe has to take out of Russian aggression of an anti -European peaceful order is "the need to support Ukraine on its democratic European path: in protecting from Russian aggression, strengthening legal institutions, in reconstruction," the chancellor said.

He noted that the CE was important for bringing the occupiers, Russian military workers and the establishment of a mechanism for recovering compensation for incredible damage caused by the Russian Federation, launching a register of losses. These issues are one of the central tasks of the current summit. Scholz also emphasized the role that the Council of Europe can play, in particular, expert opinions of the Venice Commission, in the acquisition of Ukraine and other countries that are candidates in the EU.

When the Council of Europe was organized in 1949, the memories of the Second World, Nazi Germany, were still fresh, and the peoples of the European were already behind, the cult of violence was already behind, Chancellor said. According to him, the founders of this body sought to prevent the repetition of such violence of tasses, to ensure equality of all rights and obligations.

The German leader noted that his homeland, the national socialist authorities caused unbearable suffering of Europe to Tasvit, but the war was possible because they had tried to destroy democracy, human rights to ignite hatred in Germany.

Immediately after that, Scholz moved to Ukraine on February 24, to capture its territory and move borders with force on February 24.This is the first CE summit for 18 years. Its main topic is Ukraine. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has ended with video binding participants.

“The information of some media that the wrongful benefit could have been received by the public in the interests of the entrepreneur is completely false. Zhevago never gave and could not give such instructions. He persistently asks to change unconfirmed information, not to become an instrument of manipulation and not to unconfigure him in cases, to which he has nothing to do, ” - said.

The department denied the connection of this case with the decision of the Great Pallatile Court of April 19, 2023 in the case of recognition of the legality of the acquisition in 2002 of the shares of the Poltava Mining and Processing Computer Ferrexpo, one of which is Zhevago.

It is noted that most economies that have come out of the armed conflict are anividing the long -lasting calm period for 25 years after it, neither recovered to the pre -war level of income per capita, even in the urban perspective. But, according to the report, 29 percent of the economy reaches the pre -war GDP per capita for five years. This is a study combined common features during the war.

The main feature, which is common to periods of persistent extremely high economic growth, is the high ratio of investment to GDP.

Before the war, moderate investments in Ukraine were mainly funded by extent innovative savings. The inflow of capital was only 3 percent of GDP per year in 2010-21. And foreign direct investment, as a rule, falls significantly post -conflict and require a lot of time to recover.

This was stated on Tuesday during the hearing on the Committee on Foreign Patients 10th US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, reports his own correspondent.

“The first and most important thing, Russia under the leadership of Putin is an irreconcilable opponent of the United States. [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin)He believes that Russia is fighting with us in the collision of "civilizations", they have declared it in the new formulation of their foreign policy, "- said the former high diplomat.

"Secondly, we need to work on creating an architecture of security within the framework of NATO, as well as with the help of intense bilateral and multilateral diplomatia to protect not only Ukraine but also Europe and the rest of the world of red-Russian aggression," Sullivan said.

Third, he said "there can be no confidence in the Russian government." In this connection, he recalled how in 2022 the Kremlin repeatedly stated that he did not plan to attack Ukraine. "Why should someone trust this power?" The exhibition said.

“There can be no confidence(to the Russian Federation - ed.), only a verification of the establishment of justice for Ukraine and victims of Russian military rays in Ukraine, ”the former ambassador said.

Sullivan acknowledged that it is difficult to implement diplomacy in such circumstances, but Shan should refuse to completely refuse when the national interests of America require.

“But our interests do not require the Russians to ask for dialogue, whether it is a controlling assembly or a war in Ukraine. And they want it. And it will only bring to new failures in politics, ”he said.Sullivan noted that during his stay as a US Ambassador to Moscow, he vinked the best advice: never to ask the Russians. "We must approach any of the proposed interaction or negotiations from the standpoint of Sylite confidence," the exdiplomat emphasized.

Finally, he noted that between Russia and the United States still remains the permanence of parity in the issue of diplomatic presence.

“We have an embassy in Moscow and there are no consulates. They have an embassy Vvashington and two consulates in Gouston and New York. In addition, they have more diplomats intended for a bilateral mission in the United States than we are in Russia. We need to insist on reciprocity, ”Sullivan emphasized.

“I am convinced that the summit(Council of Europe)Rejuvik occurs in a very correct time. First of all, its major theme will be the responsibility of Russia's aggression, which it constantly carries out, continuing the war against Ukraine. I am very satisfied with the fact that we will have a register of loss(caused by Russia in Ukraine - ed.), which is important for the establishment of justice, which is one in the first place for a fair peace, ”the president said [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrokomisia).

She noted that this register of damage caused is also a very important effort to rebuild Ukraine and in the administration of justice in relation to the victims of Russian aggression.

“As for peace - we have a very clear position. We strongly support the formula of President Zelensky's peace, which is presented as a basis that we will work around. This will be further discussed, but it is obvious that we will be able to follow the principle of "nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine". Ukraine is the victim of the aggressor, and it is it that should lay the foundations for the formula of peace, ”said the Liaien Founder.

She reminded that she met with President Zelensky last week, who is "very open" to discuss the formula of peace for Ukraine and its implementation.

The President of the European Commission noted that since the beginning of the war, the EU has provided Ukraine with a total amount of EUR 68 billion. Another measured European support for Ukraine is military assistance, which is the pre-competence of Member States, which are decisively tuned to provide Ukraine with self-defense, she said.

“We know that Ukrainians are fighting very bravely for their sovereignty and interest in their territory. They are fighting for the principles of international law of Thahatia of the UN. So they fight for us. Thus, for us, it is an honorary task to stand near Ukraine and maintain it for as long as it is a budget, ”Von Der Lyen emphasized.

This belief was expressed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz in his speech on the Samotirad of Europe in Reykjavik, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“One day Russian [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna)It will end. One thing is that it will not end with the victory of Putin's imperialism. We will support Ukraine until the justice is reached, ”Scholt said.

One of the main lessons that Europe has to take out of Russian aggression of an anti -European peaceful order is "the need to support Ukraine on its democratic European path: in protecting from Russian aggression, strengthening legal institutions, in reconstruction," the chancellor said.

He noted that the CE was important for bringing the occupiers, Russian military workers and the establishment of a mechanism for recovering compensation for incredible damage caused by the Russian Federation, launching a register of losses. These issues are one of the central tasks of the current summit. Scholz also emphasized the role that the Council of Europe can play, in particular, expert opinions of the Venice Commission, in the acquisition of Ukraine and other countries that are candidates in the EU.

When the Council of Europe was organized in 1949, the memories of the Second World, Nazi Germany, were still fresh, and the peoples of the European were already behind, the cult of violence was already behind, Chancellor said. According to him, the founders of this body sought to prevent the repetition of such violence of tasses, to ensure equality of all rights and obligations.

The German leader noted that his homeland, the national socialist authorities caused unbearable suffering of Europe to Tasvit, but the war was possible because they had tried to destroy democracy, human rights to ignite hatred in Germany.

Immediately after that, Scholz moved to Ukraine on February 24, to capture its territory and move borders with force on February 24.This is the first CE summit for 18 years. Its main topic is Ukraine. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has ended with video binding participants.

“Today the war has returned to [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evropa)… .Ukraine is fighting for the values that we believe in both we are and which are so exterminated for us. I am very grateful for our unity in protecting peace and in promotion of ideocracy. This is the reason from which the Council of Europe was formed, Isama has gathered us today. While Russia continues its war on democracy itself, Europe is the only one and it stands for Ukraine. This is a duty, ”the President of the European Commission emphasized.

She recalled the words of the Sakharov Prize laureate Alexandra Matviychuk, who was lying to Ukraine not because he was afraid of NATO, but in order to suppress the movement of Ukraine to democracy. That is why this war, which Russia has solved against Ukraine, is a war of values. Therefore, Europe has to take on the responsibility of the slavery of democracy.

“It is very true that the people of Ukraine requires responsibility for Russian crimes: for shelling of civilian homes, for cold -blooded executions, the suspension of children. More than 19,000 children were stolen and removed from their own years. This is exactly what this summit in Iceland should focus on, ”Ursula Der Lyen said.

She noted that such attention is important for Ukrainians, since the prospective reversal responsibility can now keep Russian soldiers the export of new military crimes. But it is also important for the future. Therefore, only justice can be the basis for a long peace in Ukraine, just peace.

The President of the European Commission emphasized - since the creation of the Council of Europe, the continent has been heading for democracy.

“We will do our best to win peace, just peace. We will do nothing for Ukraine without Ukraine. That is why we strongly support the Ukrainian formula of peace, which is the basis of the path to peace. I call us at this summit to support this peace formula. The test is coming. It is very important that we combine forces. Ukrainians are struggling with suicide and for freedom. This is our joint struggle, and we will stand on their Botthat for a long time. Glory to Ukraine!, Let Europe live!”, The President of the European Commission has written her speech.

_**Thank you very much!** _

Ms. Prime Minister Jacobsdottir, dear Katrin, thank you for inviting the participation at the Summit of our Council of Europe and for your sincere desire to help Ukraine.

_Dear leaders of Europe!_

Today, Ukraine has passed because of a very complicated challenge - an intense Russian -currency attack. It is in such challenges that we are all now forced to pay attention.

At three o'clock in the morning our people woke up from the explosions. 18 Russian rocket launchers were in our sky, including ballistic missiles, which the terrorist state boasted. Like, they are guaranteed to bear death because they are allegedly knocked down.

Russia applied at the same time balistics, winged rockets, drones ... Especially it was especially difficult for the other defenders of the sky to protect people's lives. But all the lives were protected - all rockets were knocked down, including ballistic. One hundred percent. This is a historical result. Thank you all!

Russia is very trying to improve its ability to kill. We are very trying to improve the protection of our people. I thank all the countries and leaders that work out for us to improve our air defense!We all show that Takenashi with you one hundred percent, what is the power of the free world.

And, of course, I thank each of our soldiers who do this work in our land and on our land, and especially I thank everyone who trains our warriors of cross -out training missions, which are all similar in one - in success. Thank you all!Thank you all!

A year ago, we could not knock down most terrorists, and specialty. And I ask: if we were able to do it, then there is something we can't when we are united and tuned to protect life? Answer: We are one hundred percent in any field, when the goal is to protect our people of Nasha Europe.

Of course, there is a lot to do. The territory of Ukraine is significant, and that such a result of air defense, like this night, be a rule throughout the territory, requires specialty air defense systems and missiles. Modern fighters are also needed, without which the air defense system will not be perfect. I'm sure we'll come to this.

One hundred percent should be a benchmark for us. We have zero percent to leave the aggressor!One hundred percent of the success of sanctions - it is guaranteed by honesty in the policy of each state. Thank you to everyone who treats the fight against terror - honestly!

One hundred percent of the success of our peace formula - it is guaranteed by diplomacy. Thank you who helps us to unite the world to implement the formula of peace - the only realistic peace plan!

But, of course, one hundred percent of justice - there is no reliable peace of rationality.

Thank you to the Council of Europe - each of you personally!- for the decision on the register of losses caused by Russia's aggression. This brings the creation of a full -fledged compensation mechanism that will show the world that aggression does not even think of thinking.

There should also be a special tribunal for the crime of aggression, so that the terror is answered in whose heads this terror is born. I am sure that we will give this result for one hundred percent.

Europe expected such a time - a time when leaders for the sake of protecting Europe, for the sake of our common values with you, would have been in one hundred percent unity and ascetic percent results.

That's what we achieve!Ukraine and all of Europe. Everyone and everyone who is now this summit and who helps us.

We are Europeans, and therefore we are free. We are Europeans, and therefore we value peace. We are Europeans, and therefore, we act on one hundred percent of our forces when you need to protect your lifestyle. Let it be the rules for our continent forever!

**_Thank you for your support!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

** _ Glory to all of Europe!_ **

This was emphasized by the Secretaries of National Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexey Danilov in an interview for the Facts of the Week on ICTV on Monday, May 15, 2023.

“Chechnya is occupied by the Russian Federation today. In 2008, Putin committed an act of aggression on a non -volatile Georgia. In the summer of 2014, the Russian Military SPRK BUK destroyed aircraft. In 2014, the Russians invaded our country ... ” - reminded Vavdanilov.

Unfortunately, the NSDC secretary noted, the civilized world then "worried, worried, but did not make any decisions regarding the aggressor country."

To date, he emphasized, "there is no decision on the future of Russia after war" because it "is a hostage of illusions about Russia's power through nuclear potential."

"If someone believes that Russia should stay in the same form in which it is a Blado of War, after our victory, then the question of activation of Russian swinging, imperialism," said Alexei Danilov, adding that then RFProtrotag will succeed in aggression about aggression another country. "They will calm down if they exist within the limits in which they exist," he saved.

“It is about people who either deliberately worked on the aggressor or were forced to do. They are told that hostilities will soon begin, that this territory will be fired and bombed, so they will convince and work with the Russians, ”said Andrey Chernyak, a representative of the RBC-Ukraine.

According to a representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the so-called evacuation of the packed territories of southern Ukraine, Russians use as a screen to carry counterintelligence and filtration measures: “They, first, are bad that the population can observe their preparation for battles-that is, certain counterintelligence measures. It is also filtration, because, first of all, there is a forced export of the pro -Ukrainian population. And thirdly, the Russians are afraid of holding in these territories of some guerrilla movement and internal resistance, ”Andrey Chernyak said.

At the same time a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine [reported](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/zhest-dobroyi-voli-chi-pochali-rosiyani-tikati-1684096645.html)that the removal of Russian combat units from Zaporizhzhya, or from the Kherson regions, is not being recorded. In the occupied territories of these two regions, there are now approximately 152 thousand personnel of enemy troops, and all their actions indicate that they are preparing a pre -defense.

Almost all former Ukrainian prisoners of war were tortured.

“In the vast majority of our prisoners of war, they are tortured both during the" reception "and in the pre -trial detention center of the Russian Federation or in temporarily occupied territories. According to the reviews of the last liberated, in our occupied territories, they have improved somewhat, they may already feel that they will respond for making them. To their torture, they add element psychological pressure, try to influence the worldview. Now they give lectures on the topic of Ukrainian history - they prove that it has never been existed. And for such indoctrination, candidates of sciences are invited. The purpose is to change our citizens' consciousness, consciousness and social behavior.

However, I must say that our servicemen are very stable and are not influential in Russian propaganda. It is indicated that they were captured by media diversity - they could get information from different sources. "

Among the means of psychological pressure, the representative of the Research Central Central Affairs of the Armed Forces called the forcing our combatants to sing gymnasiums and songs of the communist time:

“We already have a whole list of songs that are forced by the racists to study and sing with the content of imprisonment. It is "Victory Day", "Katyusha", other songs of the Soviet kid - everything that is connected with imperial scraps. "

At the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Russian invaders intensified the control of the supervisors, so it is forbidden to communicate with each other. In this way, the invaders are trying to mask their own fire positions of Tavian equipment in the station.

About it [reports](https://t.me/energoatom_ua/13098)Energoatom.

The rules of work and staying on the facility or not less for the employees are becoming more tougher.

“After a recently entered ban on using even a button phone, Russian terrorists are introduced to personnel by more restrictions for personnel.

Before the working change, the guards are carefully and carefully inspected the staff at the entrance, allowing them to pass to the workplaces exclusively by the trestle.

Under the harsh taboo and any movement of the territory of the ZPP, except those that were clearly defined by "local police". To go beyond the station is strictly forbidden.

While at work, employees now have the right to look only directly by the front. To turn your head and even just look away - it is strictly forbidden, ”the message goes.

Energoatom notes that the reason for such prohibitions is the efforts of Russia to assemble their own firing positions and a large number of military equipment of the stations.

Currently, about 2.5 thousand atomics remain on the ZPP.

“By the way, this is a constant question that is asked by our captives on that side. So -based pressure agrees to improve the conditions of their maintenance. But the 111st Article of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is "State Council", the third paragraph of which proceeds from criminal prosecution if the person has informed the afternoon by our authorities about attempting to recruit it.

In Russia, our captives are said - "you will come - you will be tortured, imprisoned," they are scared by the fact that they will not "get off" by the SBU.

We had such exchanges that the Russians came from wheelbarrows like tourists. They had the opportunity to work, earn money, buy something »...

Representative of the Research Center of Humanitarian Problems of the Armed Forces says that it is a worthy of Russian prisoners of war, most of them, when they return to Russia, commenting on them that they have been bullied, pressed and repeated all the rashist narratives about the Nazis, Western mercenaries ...
