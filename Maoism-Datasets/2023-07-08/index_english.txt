 Ukrainian has been playing in the fourth circle of Wimbledon.
Ukrainian tennis player Lesya Tsurenko in comment Btu.org spoke about its release to the 1/8 finals of Wimbledon, Ukrinform reports.
“I had a headache since the morning. Perhaps because of the heat today is comparable to past days. This is one of the reasons why I couldn't focus so well as I can do it. And the headache was so pulsating, especially the drawing was delayed. I think this is the main reason for the great number of mistakes because it was very difficult to keep attention.
The cramps began in the whole body: in the second set - in the hands, and in the third - even hands and legs. Therefore, some draws, unfortunately, were not very qualitatively possible because of the fact that the whole body was completely reduced. After the match, the porch could not get up and normalize my hand, because I had a nullified man. At some point, I was just afraid to get up so that I was not brought. But after the match, fortunately, it was possible to avoid the continuation of this condition, because it happens that another 40 minutes can continue. I ate very promptly everything I could. Therefore, the most important thing I managed to avoid the court after the match, ” - said Azurenko.
Lesya Tsurenko won Ana Bogdan from Romania in the third Colivimbledon - 4: 6, 6: 3, 7: 6(20-18).

The expert noted that three ports in the Ukrainian territory of the Danube-Izmail, Renite Ust-Danube-are now very active. "That is, as much as they do now, they have not overloaded almost never, except for the Soviet times, because they are one way of export not only grain products. Therefore, we now see the" Renaissance of the Danube "and an increase in the interest of investors and shippers in these ports," the Wolf said.
He noted that there are now 12 new terminals on the Danube. But he will be able to become a full replacement of the Black Sea port, the wolf stated.

"Questions in money. First, send large ship parties is much more advantageous. Second, the railway tariff for the Danube was more expensive than to Portosta, and now the cost of transshipment on the Danube is very high for many," the expert.
According to him, the main problem of the Danube is depths that do not allow to work with large ship parties. Therefore, it is very important to get a consent side for dredging work, as well as to disregard a number of other technological moments, including the possibility of using the raid transshipment to Romania without the involvement of its fleet."In particular, there is a Convention of Espo, which regulates the dredging of the mouth and has blocked such capabilities.

“I had a headache since the morning. Perhaps because of the heat today is comparable to past days. This is one of the reasons why I couldn't focus so well as I can do it. And the headache was so pulsating, especially the drawing was delayed. I think this is the main reason for the great number of mistakes because it was very difficult to keep attention.

Therefore, some draws, unfortunately, were not very qualitatively possible because of the fact that the whole body was completely reduced. After the match, the porch could not get up and normalize my hand, because I had a nullified man. At some point, I was just afraid to get up so that I was not brought. But after the match, fortunately, it was possible to avoid the continuation of this condition, because it happens that another 40 minutes can continue. I ate very promptly everything I could.

 The history of cassette ammunition is exactly the same story when, in the case of an important weapon for us, they begin to talk about political restrictions, while simply solved technical details.
This opinion was expressed by the expert, the Defense Express enlightenment, Ivan Kirichevsky, commenting on Ukrainian radio US decisions on the transfer of cassette ammunition to Ukraine.
"Even in the case of M777 howls, which were passed in April, we have a story that the Americans have told that" it is a red line and do not even dream ", they just had a problem with how these howitzers to repair and then to be renovated. And it turns out that they covered their technical problems with stories of propolitical moments. As well as with cassette shells, "Kirichevsky said.
Read also: Germany reacted restrained to the US decision to convey to Ukraine casset no ammunition At the same time, he stressed that it is a weapon, which can increase several times, not the number of disposed of Russian invaders.
DPICM shells were manufactured in the 70's-90s. Accordingly, the issues of level technical serviceability really arise, the expert added. And it turns out that the abandoned by the information confrontation in the United States generated white noise that "these shells will not give, there are technical restrictions that the cassette shells are used only with the level so that there are no more than 2%of ammunition They work ", the US military actually at this time was literally released by DPICM shells that lay 20 years of lass(what should be transferred for disposal and what can be given to the Armed Forces).
І виходить рішення щодо передачі касетних снарядів Україні визріло рівно в тоймомент, коли був сформований пакет, скільки саме снарядів можна віддати,вважає експерт. Виявилось, що декілька сотень тисяч. Тож якщо союзникипочинають розповідати про ймовірні політичні обмеження, варто бути готовими дотого, що ця зброя просто приводиться до технічного стану, щоб бути переданоюЗСУ. І щойно ця зброя буде відремонтована, тоді всі розповіді будуть обійденікрасивими риторичними фразами, наголосив Киричевський.
"If you mention the phrases that the Pentagon or White House representatives were declared yesterday, we see that they are not concerned about how cassette ammunition, at which level, is there in the US legislation. , the toys of our population will suffer first and foremost from the Russian invaders. Iv is that all political motifs were "compressed" into this phrase. This once again shows that the question of cassette shells was technical and concerned the condition of the shells, not the topic of political limits, " The expert believes.
As reported by Ukrinform, the US Department of Defense officially announced the separation of a new military aid package with a total of $ 800 million, which includes cassette ammunition.
US Deputy Defense Minister Colin Calus said it was a DPICM cafeter for 155 mm howitzers. They will have a coefficient of unbearable -sulfur not more than 2.5%, - said US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan.

 Ukraine stands firmly and steadfastly, Ukrainian society believes in the Armed Forces, which is liberated temporarily occupied territories, and international support for Ukrainians and unconditional support. Instead, Russia not only did not reach any of the assaults, but also critically undermined its military and economic potential, has finally turned into a label state in the international arena of the Tavista Dictatorship, whose regime has recently demonstrated the world.
These are the main results as of 500 days of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine. There were millions of examples of the courage of icheroism so that not only the world would not only believe in Ukraine, but above all, the Ukrainians themselves were convinced of their own strength and stability. The bloody war finally lifted the Poland of Russian propaganda, as arrogant as it is a misconception, not only the world, but also the Russians themselves.
 It turned out that modest and unimaginable, at first glance, Ukraine is a full-fledged state, able to withstand and withstand the most extreme crash test from all possible-the test of the Great War. Despite all the extraordinary difficulties, the Ukrainian state has proven that it is vital due to the fact that it is relieved by a drink of mature and responsible civil society, ready -made statin protection of the country as the most valuable of its property and the key to respect for human rights.
Whereas the acquired Russia, with its arrogance and high self -esteem, with a cordial superficial position in the international arena finally finally performed its rotten inside. At the end of the Sixteenth Monthly, it clearly proved not only the usual already human -hate policy, but also the helplessness of the Russian state apparatus and the army, which is incapable of resolving the obvious threat of a military rebellion.
 Deookupopovanka of the territory of Ukraine, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)
The Russian invaders of Ukraine are even greater on the eve of 500 days of the war. The heavy but unspo than the Ukrainian offensive continues, its inhabited indicators are not only new released territories, but the losses that have grown significantly during May - early July. Particular attention should be paid to the total extermination of enemy artsystems - practically a day Russian invaders lose several several or several dozen -artillery.
June 2023 became a hot moon, during which the enemy lost more than 650 artes. The hottest was the day from June 22 to June 23, when the Armed Forces destroyed 44 units of enemy artillery. If you also add losses here for the end of April - grass, as well as in the first days of July, you can see that more than a quarter of the beginning from the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russian artillery is more than two months. This testifies to the high efficiency of the Counter -battering of the Armed Forces and gradually changes the artillery potential in favor of the Ukrainian army. Where the Russians take exclusively the number, Ukrainian artillerymen are significantly benefit from quality, the accuracy of fire damage.
Equally important are the losses of enemy auto -engineering and air defense. Authorities with hostile losses of living power, tanks, combat armored machinery in May - the beginning of July 2023, this testifies to the success of the Ukrainian offensive. It has already been manifested in the form of a large territory and a number of settlements, with the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was possible to liberate the area of Ukrainian land, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In general, the area of the de -cupovated as of 500 daytreads was practically equal to part of the Ukrainian territory, captured by the state of February 24, 2022.
 Controller(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)As of the 500th day of the war, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a strategic initiative and confidently occur, causing the enemy of critical losses. Instead, as a result of the loss for the Russian army of war and domesticity, the very existence of the Putin regime was threatened.
Let's keep the line!

 Today, on the 500th day of the Great War - a large -scale attack of Russian federation on the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine, the 50 years of the head of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnaya have turned. However, it is unlikely that it is to really look for signs in random coincidences and numerological calculations. Moreover, it does not miss other signs much more vivid.
The first of them is timeliness. In times of disasters and difficult trials, the Ukrainian international has always found among their sons and daughters of people worthy and capable of responsibility for the future and to defend the country. Millions of people, each of whom work for a common Ukrainian victory.
So the second sign is a unique typicality. Valery Zaluzhny is one of millions of Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who stood up for their land. Everyone and everyone can be said that their daily heroism is both typical, and widespread and unique, because always individual, personal.
 Another feature is staying in its place. General Zaluzhny is one of the cohorts of Ukrainian officers, each of whom serves the Ukrainian people where it was most necessary and timely. Remember how many times from the momentary -scale invasion Russian aggressors have changed the commander of the Russian troops invasion of Ukraine. The commander -in -chief shifts unchanged. This is not about his irreplaceability(In the armed forces of Ukraine enough professional and talented officers), and the lack of disabilities to change the one who performs his work in the sophisticated conditional war.
Finally, another noticeable distinction of Valery Zaluzhny, inherent in the Ukrainian military, is a combination of calm restrained strength and humanity. This is especially noticeable against the backdrop of Russian officers, not like living people, but of ending dubs - Urfin's soldiers from a fairy tale. An illustrative example is Suregie Surovika, unable to tie two -word even reading from the telesufler.
 
It is because of these qualities that they are respected and loved, they are trusted and believed in them. The weapons of Ukraine believe that the Ukrainian military is such a self -part of the Ukrainian people that the Cossacks once were. It seems that the brownies are such as modern Ukrainian fighters - brave and fun, resourceful and kind, honest and frank.
 The best Ukrainian military goes to the image of a fairy -tale Kotygoroshko - a strong at the same time a just and generous, ready to admire the enemy in the event that he seems and behave politely, but also able to destroy the subtle enemy when he tries to use the kindness.
That is why Kotygoroshka Koval burns the strongest mace as the strongest weapon in the face of the snake. That is why he finds the faithful brothers and assistants to the Vernigora, Vernidub and Krutivus. That is why he helps in the struggle of lunality everything that is good in this world - birds and beasts, Tudrev flowers, sun, wind and rain… Because when you are on the side of good, then the good is the same.
From dew and water, Valery Fedorovich. Many summer. Victory and Peace to Ukraine.

 The history of cassette ammunition is exactly the same story when, in the case of an important weapon for us, they begin to talk about political restrictions, while simply solved technical details.
This opinion was expressed by the expert, the Defense Express enlightenment, Ivan Kirichevsky, commenting on Ukrainian radio US decisions on the transfer of cassette ammunition to Ukraine.
"Even in the case of M777 howls, which were passed in April, we have a story that the Americans have told that" it is a red line and do not even dream ", they just had a problem with how these howitzers to repair and then to be renovated. And it turns out that they covered their technical problems with stories of propolitical moments. As well as with cassette shells, "Kirichevsky said.
Read also: Germany reacted restrained to the US decision to convey to Ukraine casset no ammunition At the same time, he stressed that it is a weapon, which can increase several times, not the number of disposed of Russian invaders.
DPICM shells were manufactured in the 70's-90s. Accordingly, the issues of level technical serviceability really arise, the expert added. And it turns out that the abandoned by the information confrontation in the United States generated white noise that "these shells will not give, there are technical restrictions that the cassette shells are used only with the level so that there are no more than 2%of ammunition They work ", the US military actually at this time was literally released by DPICM shells that lay 20 years of lass(what should be transferred for disposal and what can be given to the Armed Forces).
І виходить рішення щодо передачі касетних снарядів Україні визріло рівно в тоймомент, коли був сформований пакет, скільки саме снарядів можна віддати,вважає експерт. Виявилось, що декілька сотень тисяч. Тож якщо союзникипочинають розповідати про ймовірні політичні обмеження, варто бути готовими дотого, що ця зброя просто приводиться до технічного стану, щоб бути переданоюЗСУ. І щойно ця зброя буде відремонтована, тоді всі розповіді будуть обійденікрасивими риторичними фразами, наголосив Киричевський.
"If you mention the phrases that the Pentagon or White House representatives were declared yesterday, we see that they are not concerned about how cassette ammunition, at which level, is there in the US legislation. , the toys of our population will suffer first and foremost from the Russian invaders. Iv is that all political motifs were "compressed" into this phrase. This once again shows that the question of cassette shells was technical and concerned the condition of the shells, not the topic of political limits, " The expert believes.
As reported by Ukrinform, the US Department of Defense officially announced the separation of a new military aid package with a total of $ 800 million, which includes cassette ammunition.
US Deputy Defense Minister Colin Calus said it was a DPICM cafeter for 155 mm howitzers. They will have a coefficient of unbearable -sulfur not more than 2.5%, - said US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan.

 The task of protecting the sky over Kiev from Russian missiles is almost solved, now the military is working on protecting against missile strikes in Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporozhye and Odessa.
About it the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov reported у мережі Facebook.
«Я не вірив, що росіяни почнуть обстрілювати ракетами мирні міста. Бо цеочевидно суперечило їхній меті. Тому надійний захист нашого неба сприймаю якособистий виклик. У Києві ми майже вирішили це завдання. У Львові, Харкові,Дніпрі, Запоріжжі, Одесі — ще ні, але працюємо», — заявив він.
Як підкреслив міністр, він не міг уявити, що населення такої великої країни,як рф може тотально втратити мораль, деградувати до тваринного стану. «Проявими бачимо не тільки у страшних злочинах, ми це чуємо у спілкуванні дітей збатьками, чоловіків із дружинами в росії. Вони самі себе розлюднили», — додавглава оборонного відомства України.
Вперше, за словами Олексія Резнікова, його це вразило, коли на перемовинах убілорусі в березні минулого року він пропонував російський стороні забратитисяч тіл їхніх знищених солдатів, розкиданих по українських лісах і полях.
Він зауважив, що росіяни не просто відмовилися від своїх — вони брехали одинодному, що цих втрат немає.
На думку очільника Міноборони, щоб виправити цю моральну деградацію,знадобляться десятиліття.
Тому ми повинні не просто звільнити від них нашу землю — ми повинні зробититак, щоб це зло дуже довго не могло оговтатися і кілька поколінь не булоздатне на агресію», — заявив міністр.
За словами Резнікова, 500 днів тому ніхто б не повірив, що Україна опиниться уточці, де перебуває зараз. «Кожного дня ми просуваємося. Саме тому так багатоохочих штовхнути на хибний шлях», — додав він.
«Після війни це буде нова Україна. Або не буде ніякої», — додав він.
Олексій Резніков попередив, що Україну найближчим часом може очікувати багатопотрясінь, адже українці не тільки б’ються з жорстоким ворогом, вони виборюютьсвоє місце у світі і своє бачення перемоги. «Великий світ — це конкуренція», —підкреслив він.
«Далі буде дуже важко. Буде тиск, будуть втрати і руйнування. Будерозчарування і зневіра. Це нормально, адже випробування насправді великі. Мирухаємось вгору. Будьте певні — ми все здолаємо, у нас все вийде. У нас єсправжні друзі, це багато важить», — заявив міністр оборони.
