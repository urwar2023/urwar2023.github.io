Ukrainian tennis player Lesya Tsurenko in [comment](https://btu.org.ua/ua/golovne/45743-lesya-curenko-u-deyakih-momentah-matchiv-koli-vzhe-sil-zovsim-nemaye-ya-sobi-nagaduyu-sho-ya-z-ukrayini.html)Btu.org spoke about its release to the 1/8 finals of Wimbledon, Ukrinform reports.

“I had a headache since the morning. Perhaps because of the heat today is comparable to past days. This is one of the reasons why I couldn't focus so well as I can do it. And the headache was so pulsating, especially the drawing was delayed. I think this is the main reason for the great number of mistakes because it was very difficult to keep attention.

The cramps began in the whole body: in the second set - in the hands, and in the third - even hands and legs. Therefore, some draws, unfortunately, were not very qualitatively possible because of the fact that the whole body was completely reduced. After the match, the porch could not get up and normalize my hand, because I had a nullified man. At some point, I was just afraid to get up so that I was not brought. But after the match, fortunately, it was possible to avoid the continuation of this condition, because it happens that another 40 minutes can continue. I ate very promptly everything I could. Therefore, the most important thing I managed to avoid the court after the match, ” - said Azurenko.

Lesya Tsurenko won Ana Bogdan from Romania in the third Colivimbledon - 4: 6, 6: 3, 7: 6(20-18).

This was said in a comment [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101804)Director of the Transportation Center Sergey Vovk, Ukrinform reports.

The expert noted that three ports in the Ukrainian territory of the Danube-Izmail, Renite Ust-Danube-are now very active. "That is, as much as they do now, they have not overloaded almost never, except for the Soviet times, because they are one way of export not only grain products. Therefore, we now see the" Renaissance of the Danube "and an increase in the interest of investors and shippers in these ports," the Wolf said.

He noted that there are now 12 new terminals on the Danube. But he will be able to become a full replacement of the Black Sea port, the wolf stated.

If you talk on grain, 50% went through the ports of Odessa within the grain initiative, 25% through the Danube and another 25% through Western border crossings. About 20 million tons, ” - said the director of the Center for Transport Strategies.

According to him, [Danube](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-dunaj)He has received a second one in order to be a transport artery and to help the Ukrainian economy, it is important that after the ports of Greater Odessa have been opened, it remained a priority area of development and export logistics.

"Questions in money. First, send large ship parties is much more advantageous. Second, the railway tariff for the Danube was more expensive than to Portosta, and now the cost of transshipment on the Danube is very high for many," the expert.

According to him, the main problem of the Danube is depths that do not allow to work with large ship parties. Therefore, it is very important to get a consent side for dredging work, as well as to disregard a number of other technological moments, including the possibility of using the raid transshipment to Romania without the involvement of its fleet."In particular, there is a Convention of Espo, which regulates the dredging of the mouth and has blocked such capabilities. In Sulina, it is loaded on Ukrainian ports and flows through the Ukrainian part into the sea with loads, "Vovk said.

He added that the delegation of the Ministry of Infrastructure and restoration is constantly working with the Romanian side.

As it was reported, PJSC "Ukrainian Danube Shipping" discusses the mastery of contracting contracts with world grain traders on transportation of agro -production of the Middle Danube.

Because it was obviously contrary to their purpose. Therefore, the reliable protection of our sky is perceived by the most common challenge. In Kiev, we almost solved this task. In Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporozhye, Odessa - we are not, but we work, ”he said.

As the minister emphasized, he could not imagine that the population of such a great country as [RF](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)It can totally lose morality, degrade to animal condition. “We see manifestations not only in the terrible rays, we hear it in communicating children with parents, men with the wives of uredia.

"Therefore, we must not only release our land from them - we must make this evil not recover for a very long time and a few generations have not been able to aggression," the minister said.

According to Reznikov, the continuation of the battle is not a war for abstract normative law, it is a battle for the right to live freely, happily on its beautiful land and to determine the future.

“After the war it will be a new Ukraine. Or there will be no, ”he added.

Reznikov warned that Ukraine can expect multiple in the near future, because Ukrainians not only fight with a cruel enemy, they choose a kind of place in the world and their victory. "The great world is competition," he said.“It will be very difficult. There will be pressure, there will be losses and destruction. There will be frustration and despair. This is normal, because the test is actually large. We peace up. Be sure - we will overcome everything, we will succeed. We have true friends, it weighs a lot, ”the Minister of Defense said.

According to Reznikov, 500 days ago, no one would believe that Ukraine would be the point where it is now. “We move every day. That is why it is so much to push for the wrong way, ”he added.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-08T18-42-51-03-00/630_360_1681376742-155.jpg)France is against the opening of NATO's office in Japan. The President of the country believes that the alias should be "geographically limited" by Northern Atlantic.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-block-nato-outpost-japan-china-complaints/)With reference to informed sources.

Within a few months, NATO officials have discussed plans to open a communication office in Japan, which would become the first outpost of allies in Asia.

Progress in this regard should happen at the annual summit [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato), which will take place in Lithuania next week.

However, French President Emmanuel Macron denies the expediency of such a geographical expansion of the Alliance, insisting that it will lead to the "risk" of NATO's powers "too far" from its initial novo -Atlantic orientation, Politico notes.

“We are fundamentally not“ for ”(The idea of NATO expansion - ed.). Що стосується офісу,японська влада сама сказала нам, що не дуже прихильна до його створення», –заявив Макрон у п’ятницю.

На переконання французького президента, НАТО має бути географічно обмеженеПівнічною Атлантикою. Він додав, що статті 5 і 6, які складають основуПівнічноатлантичного договору, є «географічними».

У виданні зазначають, що план НАТО щодо відкриття першого азійського офісуз’явився на тлі підвищеної стурбованості агресивною морською та повітряноюповедінкою Китаю щодо Тайваню, а також військ США в регіоні.

Проти ідеї відкриття офісу Альянсу в Японії окрім Франції виступає такожКитай.

As reported by Ukrinform, NATO's next summit will take place in Vilnius on 11-12. Among the main topics of discussion will be the continuation of assistance for Ukraine to fight against Russian aggression.

Ukrainian tennis player Lesya Tsurenko in [comment](https://btu.org.ua/ua/golovne/45743-lesya-curenko-u-deyakih-momentah-matchiv-koli-vzhe-sil-zovsim-nemaye-ya-sobi-nagaduyu-sho-ya-z-ukrayini.html)Btu.org spoke about its release to the 1/8 finals of Wimbledon, Ukrinform reports.

“I had a headache since the morning. Perhaps because of the heat today is comparable to past days. This is one of the reasons why I couldn't focus so well as I can do it. And the headache was so pulsating, especially the drawing was delayed. I think this is the main reason for the great number of mistakes because it was very difficult to keep attention.

The cramps began in the whole body: in the second set - in the hands, and in the third - even hands and legs. Therefore, some draws, unfortunately, were not very qualitatively possible because of the fact that the whole body was completely reduced. After the match, the porch could not get up and normalize my hand, because I had a nullified man. At some point, I was just afraid to get up so that I was not brought. But after the match, fortunately, it was possible to avoid the continuation of this condition, because it happens that another 40 minutes can continue. I ate very promptly everything I could. Therefore, the most important thing I managed to avoid the court after the match, ” - said Azurenko.

Lesya Tsurenko won Ana Bogdan from Romania in the third Colivimbledon - 4: 6, 6: 3, 7: 6(20-18).

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-08T22-19-00-03-00/630_360_1688842643-946.jpg)The history of cassette ammunition is exactly the same story when, in the case of an important weapon for us, they begin to talk about political restrictions, while simply solved technical details.

This opinion was expressed by the expert, the Defense Express enlightenment, Ivan Kirichevsky, commenting on [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101809)US decisions on the transfer of cassette ammunition to Ukraine.

"Even in the case of M777 howls, which were passed in April, we have a story that the Americans have told that" it is a red line and do not even dream ", they just had a problem with how these howitzers to repair and then to be renovated. And it turns out that they covered their technical problems with stories of propolitical moments. As well as with cassette shells, "Kirichevsky said.

DPICM shells were manufactured in the 70's-90s. Accordingly, the issues of level technical serviceability really arise, the expert added. And it turns out that the abandoned by the information confrontation in the United States generated white noise that "these shells will not give, there are technical restrictions that the cassette shells are used only with the level so that there are no more than 2%of ammunition They work ", the US military actually at this time was literally released by DPICM shells that lay 20 years of lass(what should be transferred for disposal and what can be given to the Armed Forces).

І виходить рішення щодо передачі касетних снарядів Україні визріло рівно в тоймомент, коли був сформований пакет, скільки саме снарядів можна віддати,вважає експерт. Виявилось, що декілька сотень тисяч. Тож якщо союзникипочинають розповідати про ймовірні політичні обмеження, варто бути готовими дотого, що ця зброя просто приводиться до технічного стану, щоб бути переданоюЗСУ. І щойно ця зброя буде відремонтована, тоді всі розповіді будуть обійденікрасивими риторичними фразами, наголосив Киричевський.

"If you mention the phrases that the Pentagon or White House representatives were declared yesterday, we see that they are not concerned about how cassette ammunition, at which level, is there in the US legislation. , the toys of our population will suffer first and foremost from the Russian invaders. Iv is that all political motifs were "compressed" into this phrase. This once again shows that the question of cassette shells was technical and concerned the condition of the shells, not the topic of political limits, " The expert believes.

As reported by Ukrinform, the US Department of Defense officially announced the separation of a new military aid package with a total of $ 800 million, which includes cassette ammunition.

US Deputy Defense Minister Colin Calus said it was a DPICM cafeter for 155 mm howitzers. They will have a coefficient of unbearable -sulfur not more than 2.5%, - said US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan.

The analogic opinion was also expressed in the Ministry of Defense of Spain.

Germany opposes the use of cassette ammunition in general, but Ukraine is about protecting its territory and civilian population, said a spokesman for the Federal Government of Germany Steffen Gebestrytit.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T44-00-00-04-00/golovna-.jpeg)Ukraine stands firmly and steadfastly, Ukrainian society believes in the Armed Forces, which is liberated temporarily occupied territories, and international support for Ukrainians and unconditional support. Instead, Russia not only did not reach any of the assaults, but also critically undermined its military and economic potential, has finally turned into a label state in the international arena of the Tavista Dictatorship, whose regime has recently demonstrated the world.

These are the main results as of 500 days of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine. There were millions of examples of the courage of icheroism so that not only the world would not only believe in Ukraine, but above all, the Ukrainians themselves were convinced of their own strength and stability. The bloody war finally lifted the Poland of Russian propaganda, as arrogant as it is a misconception, not only the world, but also the Russians themselves.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T44-00-00-04-00/vtraty-rf-100-scaled.jpg)It turned out that modest and unimaginable, at first glance, Ukraine is a full-fledged state, able to withstand and withstand the most extreme crash test from all possible-the test of the Great War. Despite all the extraordinary difficulties, the Ukrainian state has proven that it is vital due to the fact that it is relieved by a drink of mature and responsible civil society, ready -made statin protection of the country as the most valuable of its property and the key to respect for human rights.

Whereas the acquired Russia, with its arrogance and high self -esteem, with a cordial superficial position in the international arena finally finally performed its rotten inside. At the end of the Sixteenth Monthly, it clearly proved not only the usual already human -hate policy, but also the helplessness of the Russian state apparatus and the army, which is incapable of resolving the obvious threat of a military rebellion.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T44-00-00-04-00/03-5.jpg)Deookupopovanka of the territory of Ukraine, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)

The Russian invaders of Ukraine are even greater on the eve of 500 days of the war. The heavy but unspo than the Ukrainian offensive continues, its inhabited indicators are not only new released territories, but the losses that have grown significantly during May - early July. Particular attention should be paid to the total extermination of enemy artsystems - practically a day Russian invaders lose several several or several dozen -artillery.

June 2023 became a hot moon, during which the enemy lost more than 650 artes. The hottest was the day from June 22 to June 23, when the Armed Forces destroyed 44 units of enemy artillery. If you also add losses here for the end of April - grass, as well as in the first days of July, you can see that more than a quarter of the beginning from the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russian artillery is more than two months. This testifies to the high efficiency of the Counter -battering of the Armed Forces and gradually changes the artillery potential in favor of the Ukrainian army. Where the Russians take exclusively the number, Ukrainian artillerymen are significantly benefit from quality, the accuracy of fire damage.

Equally important are the losses of enemy auto -engineering and air defense. Authorities with hostile losses of living power, tanks, combat armored machinery in May - the beginning of July 2023, this testifies to the success of the Ukrainian offensive. It has already been manifested in the form of a large territory and a number of settlements, with the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was possible to liberate the area of Ukrainian land, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In general, the area of the de -cupovated as of 500 daytreads was practically equal to part of the Ukrainian territory, captured by the state of February 24, 2022.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T44-00-00-04-00/05-2.jpg)Controller(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)As of the 500th day of the war, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a strategic initiative and confidently occur, causing the enemy of critical losses. Instead, as a result of the loss for the Russian army of war and domesticity, the very existence of the Putin regime was threatened.

Let's keep the line!

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T52-00-00-04-00/01_golovna-1.jpg)Today, on the 500th day of the Great War - a large -scale attack of Russian federation on the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine, the 50 years of the head of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnaya have turned. However, it is unlikely that it is to really look for signs in random coincidences and numerological calculations. Moreover, it does not miss other signs much more vivid.

The first of them is timeliness. In times of disasters and difficult trials, the Ukrainian international has always found among their sons and daughters of people worthy and capable of responsibility for the future and to defend the country. Millions of people, each of whom work for a common Ukrainian victory.

So the second sign is a unique typicality. Valery Zaluzhny is one of millions of Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who stood up for their land. Everyone and everyone can be said that their daily heroism is both typical, and widespread and unique, because always individual, personal.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T52-00-00-04-00/02-4.jpeg)Another feature is staying in its place. General Zaluzhny is one of the cohorts of Ukrainian officers, each of whom serves the Ukrainian people where it was most necessary and timely. Remember how many times from the momentary -scale invasion Russian aggressors have changed the commander of the Russian troops invasion of Ukraine. The commander -in -chief shifts unchanged. This is not about his irreplaceability(In the armed forces of Ukraine enough professional and talented officers), and the lack of disabilities to change the one who performs his work in the sophisticated conditional war.

Finally, another noticeable distinction of Valery Zaluzhny, inherent in the Ukrainian military, is a combination of calm restrained strength and humanity. This is especially noticeable against the backdrop of Russian officers, not like living people, but of ending dubs - Urfin's soldiers from a fairy tale. An illustrative example is Suregie Surovika, unable to tie two -word even reading from the telesufler.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T52-00-00-04-00/03-7.jpg)

It is because of these qualities that they are respected and loved, they are trusted and believed in them. The weapons of Ukraine believe that the Ukrainian military is such a self -part of the Ukrainian people that the Cossacks once were. It seems that the brownies are such as modern Ukrainian fighters - brave and fun, resourceful and kind, honest and frank.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T52-00-00-04-00/04-5.jpg)The best Ukrainian military goes to the image of a fairy -tale Kotygoroshko - a strong at the same time a just and generous, ready to admire the enemy in the event that he seems and behave politely, but also able to destroy the subtle enemy when he tries to use the kindness.

That is why Kotygoroshka Koval burns the strongest mace as the strongest weapon in the face of the snake. That is why he finds the faithful brothers and assistants to the Vernigora, Vernidub and Krutivus. That is why he helps in the struggle of lunality everything that is good in this world - birds and beasts, Tudrev flowers, sun, wind and rain… Because when you are on the side of good, then the good is the same.

From dew and water, Valery Fedorovich. Many summer. Victory and Peace to Ukraine.

Like the results of previous polls, the vast majority of respondent people consider NATO important for their country's future security(73%), and 70%would vote in a referendum for their country to remain a member of NATO.

Supporting at the current level or increasing defensive expenditures increased 73% of respondents.

Most respondents share the idea that their country must protect the other NATO member in the event of an attack(64%), and 62% of respondents believe that thanks to the external attack on their country, the Alliance is less likely.

Negatively perceive Russia two -thirds of respondents(66%). Цей показникзбігається з тенденціями, виявленими за підсумками минулорічного опитування.

Подібно до опитування громадської думки, що проводилося напередодні самітуНАТО у 2022 році, одним із параметрів було сприйняття вторгнення росії вУкраїну.

Майже дві третини респондентів в державах–членах Альянсу вважають, щовторгнення росії в Україну позначилося на безпеці і спокої їхньої країни(64%). Підтримка респондентами продовження надання їхніми країнами допомогиУкраїні залишається високою і становить 65%.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-08T6-19-00-03-00/630_360_1688842643-946.jpg)The history of cassette ammunition is exactly the same story when, in the case of an important weapon for us, they begin to talk about political restrictions, while simply solved technical details.

This opinion was expressed by the expert, the Defense Express enlightenment, Ivan Kirichevsky, commenting on [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101809)US decisions on the transfer of cassette ammunition to Ukraine.

"Even in the case of M777 howls, which were passed in April, we have a story that the Americans have told that" it is a red line and do not even dream ", they just had a problem with how these howitzers to repair and then to be renovated. And it turns out that they covered their technical problems with stories of propolitical moments. As well as with cassette shells, "Kirichevsky said.

** Read also: ** [Germany reacted restrained to the US decision to convey to Ukraine ** casset ** no ammunition](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3733309-nimeccina-strimano-vidreaguvala-na-risenna-ssa-peredati-ukraini-kasetni-boepripasi.html)At the same time, he stressed that it is a weapon, which can increase several times, not the number of disposed of Russian invaders.

DPICM shells were manufactured in the 70's-90s. Accordingly, the issues of level technical serviceability really arise, the expert added. And it turns out that the abandoned by the information confrontation in the United States generated white noise that "these shells will not give, there are technical restrictions that the cassette shells are used only with the level so that there are no more than 2%of ammunition They work ", the US military actually at this time was literally released by DPICM shells that lay 20 years of lass(what should be transferred for disposal and what can be given to the Armed Forces).

І виходить рішення щодо передачі касетних снарядів Україні визріло рівно в тоймомент, коли був сформований пакет, скільки саме снарядів можна віддати,вважає експерт. Виявилось, що декілька сотень тисяч. Тож якщо союзникипочинають розповідати про ймовірні політичні обмеження, варто бути готовими дотого, що ця зброя просто приводиться до технічного стану, щоб бути переданоюЗСУ. І щойно ця зброя буде відремонтована, тоді всі розповіді будуть обійденікрасивими риторичними фразами, наголосив Киричевський.

"If you mention the phrases that the Pentagon or White House representatives were declared yesterday, we see that they are not concerned about how cassette ammunition, at which level, is there in the US legislation. , the toys of our population will suffer first and foremost from the Russian invaders. Iv is that all political motifs were "compressed" into this phrase. This once again shows that the question of cassette shells was technical and concerned the condition of the shells, not the topic of political limits, " The expert believes.

As reported by Ukrinform, the US Department of Defense officially announced the separation of a new military aid package with a total of $ 800 million, which includes cassette ammunition.

US Deputy Defense Minister Colin Calus said it was a DPICM cafeter for 155 mm howitzers. They will have a coefficient of unbearable -sulfur not more than 2.5%, - said US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan.

The analogic opinion was also expressed in the Ministry of Defense of Spain.

Germany opposes the use of cassette ammunition in general, but Ukraine is about protecting its territory and civilian population, said a spokesman for the Federal Government of Germany Steffen Gebestrytit.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T85-00-00-04-00/petriot.jpg)The task of protecting the sky over Kiev from Russian missiles is almost solved, now the military is working on protecting against missile strikes in Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporozhye and Odessa.

About it the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov [reported](https://www.facebook.com/reznikovoleksii/posts/pfbid02GpsdiFsKgbGbcnayoaHLsgwAYQyJQYhNd1pJ8V1ZE9ZsgCAZB2teruqXgojBxTeXl)у мережі Facebook.

«Я не вірив, що росіяни почнуть обстрілювати ракетами мирні міста. Бо цеочевидно суперечило їхній меті. Тому надійний захист нашого неба сприймаю якособистий виклик. У Києві ми майже вирішили це завдання. У Львові, Харкові,Дніпрі, Запоріжжі, Одесі — ще ні, але працюємо», — заявив він.

Як підкреслив міністр, він не міг уявити, що населення такої великої країни,як рф може тотально втратити мораль, деградувати до тваринного стану. «Проявими бачимо не тільки у страшних злочинах, ми це чуємо у спілкуванні дітей збатьками, чоловіків із дружинами в росії. Вони самі себе розлюднили», — додавглава оборонного відомства України.

Вперше, за словами Олексія Резнікова, його це вразило, коли на перемовинах убілорусі в березні минулого року він пропонував російський стороні забратитисяч тіл їхніх знищених солдатів, розкиданих по українських лісах і полях.

Він зауважив, що росіяни не просто відмовилися від своїх — вони брехали одинодному, що цих втрат немає.

На думку очільника Міноборони, щоб виправити цю моральну деградацію,знадобляться десятиліття.

Тому ми повинні не просто звільнити від них нашу землю — ми повинні зробититак, щоб це зло дуже довго не могло оговтатися і кілька поколінь не булоздатне на агресію», — заявив міністр.

За словами Резнікова, 500 днів тому ніхто б не повірив, що Україна опиниться уточці, де перебуває зараз. «Кожного дня ми просуваємося. Саме тому так багатоохочих штовхнути на хибний шлях», — додав він.

«Після війни це буде нова Україна. Або не буде ніякої», — додав він.

Олексій Резніков попередив, що Україну найближчим часом може очікувати багатопотрясінь, адже українці не тільки б’ються з жорстоким ворогом, вони виборюютьсвоє місце у світі і своє бачення перемоги. «Великий світ — це конкуренція», —підкреслив він.

«Далі буде дуже важко. Буде тиск, будуть втрати і руйнування. Будерозчарування і зневіра. Це нормально, адже випробування насправді великі. Мирухаємось вгору. Будьте певні — ми все здолаємо, у нас все вийде. У нас єсправжні друзі, це багато важить», — заявив міністр оборони.

This opinion was expressed by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov in the Eviritolevahorphone "Unified News". He also hopes for the "goodwill" of the Russians in the near future.

- They began to delay their command and logistics points away from the area of the same HIMARS or long -range artillery, but today we have a means such as Storm Shadow and analogues from partners. This war is teaching, not only the Armed Forces of Russia or the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine, it teaches our partners too. This war will then be the subject of serious research: academic, technical, psychological, political, military, medical areas. It seems to me that the enemy is already accustomed to understanding that they are not the second army of the world. Because the goal of the "special military operation" is unattended, Kiev has not fallen in three days, Ukraine has not fallen in three weeks. On the contrary, they learned to pour heels, - he said.

The necessary set of weapons systems from Western partners is almost inadvertent. Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov said this on the air of the only news. In particular, according to him, Ukraine is still awaiting the tanks of Abrams.

- The necessary set of systems almost happened, but not yet finally. The preparation of crews will be done, something else will come. For example, the same Abrams, it was honestly told by our American partners, which they would be in early autumn and end of summer. There are basic things, but the licarters began to check their warehouses, it turned out that what we were promised, it is also not in perfect technical condition. Many countries, special European countries, lived in the paradigm of peaceful, peaceful time that the war is not in the door. And so in many countries, on the contrary, there was a reduction in the arms, reducing stocks in warehouses and freezing orders for the manufacture of means of destruction for the needs of their armed forces. It seemed to everyone that the post -year of the World War, a full -scale, open -scale fighting theater in Europe could happen. But it happened and that is why they also reconstruct it. Now I see, I hear it, I feel, I communicate with the defense ministers, I am directly involved with manufacturers, powerful companies and they all have now got a squeeze to order. Therefore, we will expect that they will continue to be as many as needed, ”the minister said.

Alexei Reznikov also said that Western partners systematically supply guns of ammunition to Ukraine and finance their industry for the production of additional units, ammunition, ammunition, various types of weapons and spare parts of the Language equipment.

-For example, the European Union project for a million 155 mm shells is already in full on the march. The factories have received orders and accordingly the order has already received the allocated funding of our European partners, - the reporting department of the defense department.

This was stated by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov on the broadcasting of the Unified News. According to him, "the mobilization system, the reserve system, centrifugal, the former" military commissions "are all the" Soviet inheritance ", which must be changed.

- make a different approach, maximum digitalization. To put it bluntly, "military commodity" should become CNAP. That's when it will be clear to the population, they will not see them, stand in line, suffer in the wandering. We need to change the approach, we need to cancel the conscription, make a professional army, but to make a clear -scale register of a reserve in case of a full -scale war, in case of shutdown. This means that our main capital is people and we need to work with them, - said the Minister of Defense.
