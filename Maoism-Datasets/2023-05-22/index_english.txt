Це неможливо забезпечити за допомогою сторонніхінструкторів, які приїжджають на певний час. Кожна військова частина повиннамати власних інструкторів, які будуть здійснювати постійне, системнетренування. Серед усієї групи ми проводимо перший модуль навчання — це тридні, потім ми формуємо програму за якою займаються визначені нами старшігрупи, вони продовжують тренувати майбутніх інструкторів. Коли вони завершатьнавчання, то будуть здійснювати правильну підготовку своїх побратимів длянадання допомоги пораненим на полі бою».

 Mr. Kisido, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the invitation to visit the summit.
Dear colleagues!
During this war, Ukraine participated six times in meetings of the Seven Group, but online. Now - a moment for personal thanks.
We, together with you and all our allies and partners, have reached such a level of work that provides for democracy, international law, to freedom.
In the world, there were efforts to ignore and despise what we value. But now it is cenived. Now our power is growing. And anyone who can wish the anti -democratic country's aggression sees what the answer will be. And the more we will work with you, the less likely it is that someone in the world will go crazy. But is this enough?
Democracy needs more. I think we need the obvious global leadership of democracy. This is the main thing that we provide our cooperation.
 Here are some examples.
For many years, we have heard that Russia can attack any country with hypersonic missiles that have not been knocked down. Russia wanted to be afraid of some moment to betray our values. Well, it is over. The "Petriets" of the Ukrainians have shown what democracy was capable of.
We together proved that the question is not how many missiles are in our country enemy, but in how many air defense systems we have. "Petriots", "Iris-T", "Nams", "Classes", "Samp-T"-they protect life in our cities and rescue a global safety brand for democracy.
When such air defense systems in Ukraine are enough to protect all cities, the world will see which air shield is able to create democracy. We are moving what the safety of the sky will be, not our enemy.
I thank you, dear leaders who helped Ukraine with air defense!Together, we have saved Russian rockets for thousands and thousands of lives of Ukrainians.
I am also grateful for the decision to train our pilots on modern fighters.
The air shield can only be complete when ground systems are filled with modern aircraft in the air. Now we are going on the way to eliminate the breakdown.
When our pilots know the F-16 and when these machines appear in our sky, it is not only for Ukraine. It will be a historic moment for the entire security architecture in Europe and the world.
 Dear colleagues!Each decision for the protection of Ukraine and freedom guarantees the preservation of international rules based on the rules. As the house grows from the bricks, so the decision with you is growing freedom - we guarantee it. We, democracy.
And our answer is, in fact, the basis for the mandatory rules for preventing aggression.
Ukraine emphasizes the principle of preventive security. That is why our suggestions for the security package for Ukraine - when they work - will become a comprehensive factor. And not just for us.
There are "safety umbrellas" in the world. And they have to open when the sky is blackened. But how will it be the one at a time, while the "security umbrella" expands to a new ally?
Just as our actions with you have saved the international law of Tasvoboda during this war, our security guarantees will work to prevent the tragedy of war. They will work to stop the potential aggressor.
Ukraine would like our teams to place dots over "i" in the case of guaranteeing Vilnius - the summit for which the Euro -Atlantic is expected.
Thank you, Mr. President Biden, that you fill the content of global safety for democracy!Thank you for the leadership, for the weapons, for the decision to feed pilots. I believe that the wings of our common freedom will be more obvious in the world!Thank you to both parties of Congress and yours, Mr. President, a team and all a love -loving American hearts.
I thank you, Olafe, Mr. Chancellor, for your determination, which changes the history of democracy, for the long -term defensive and financial support of Ukraine, which gives stability to all our free Europe. I thank your colleagues in the government, thank the Bundestag and the whole people of Germany.
I thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your energy, which gives us more and more long-range opportunities. I believe that your leadership will help to give the obvious force of law when, together with our partners, a mom -tribunal on Russia's aggression. Thank you to your colleagues, the British Parliament and the whole British people.
I thank you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, for saving the values and that the support of France of Ukraine is a manifestation of respect for freedom people, for equality in international relations, for brotherhood between people.
I thank George Meloni for the power of her character gives us all. Thank you to the Government, Parliament and all Italians who support our people's protection.Thank you, Charles, thank you, Ursulo, for being more than institutions under your leadership of the Memorial Institution. It was once said that the EU is a Tsyburecracy. You prove that our association is not kept on bureaucracy, but of the durable values that give us a strong course!
Thank you, Fumio, Mr. Prime Minister, for the obvious leadership of Japan in Asia's fate of international law, thank you for comprehensive support from your country.
Dear colleagues!
We are united by another principle - rationality. We always act practically, protecting our values. And the obvious expression of rationality is the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank you for the support of our formula.
The day before I was at the Summit of the Arab States League, and we do everything to connect the whole world around the formula of peace - around a peaceful summit, which will give a push of a formula.
I would like to discuss the steps from the implementation of the formula and details of the organization of a peaceful summit within our meetings today.
Thank you.

 Mr. Prime Minister Kishido! 
Dear leaders! 
We all have a chance to become co -authors of peace. This peace will not be for one country, as well as this war is not only harmful to Ukraine. The UN Charter and the order based on the direction were destroyed.
Everyone in the world has felt the destructive consequences of Russian aggression. Someone has worked out of crazy jumps for food or energy. Someone will see that in the case of a catastrophe on the Russian nuclear power plant, the wind is precious pollution to its land. Someone knows that if Russia manages to collapse the stolen Ukrainian territory, then on its land a receiving neighbor.
Our world is big, but we all have in it together. And this is our common thing - peace.
At one time, until February 24, Ukraine spent more than 180 rounds with Russia - 183 - in various formats for termination of aggression. There were respectful international intermediaries in those interrogations, and they saw that Russia was not looking for peace.
The truce did not work. It lasted seven years, and during this time thousands of people were killed. Now nothing has changed, except that we, when we defended ourselves, weakened Russia. Now she is frankly looking for frosts of war. Not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of winning a little time, growing strength and hitting again.
The one who has embarked on the path of terror does not come from him.
That is why our formula of peace and international law are needed. Ukraine has proposed a formula of peace to the world. While the Russian invaders remain on our earth, no one will sit at the table of negotiations with Russia. The colonizer must go away. Alesvit has a power sufficient to make Russia to restore Russia step by step. We have proven that.
As an example, food safety. This is one of the points of our peace formula.
When Russia blocked our sea, we found a way out. We agreed with the UN Iturechyna to create a corridor for food exports so that no one in the world will be angry or food shortages.
Together we stabilized the markets. So we gave the world an element of peace. And by analogy, it can also work for each other point of the formula of peace, starting with radiation - which is very dangerous - and energy security and ending the restoration of the full force of the UN Charter and our territorial integrity, so that they have been violated by Russia.
We have developed a peace formula so that each of its points is supported by resolutions. So that everyone in the world can choose the point that can help realize.From Japan to Arab countries, from Europe to Latin America - we find support for the formula of peace. And we continue this work.
Soon - 500 days of a full -scale war, in July it will be. And this is a symbolic time of time, a good moon to collect the formula of peace - the world of world. The summit of anyone who respects honesty and wants to end this war. I am going to join together!
Even if we are divided by the distance, we are united by a common understanding: you were bruised, if your home had fallen into your home if the enemy came to your gate ideported your children, you would not seem to be colonialists, you would unite all world, you would fight like We fight.
Thank you!

“For example, we reduced our car exports in the Russian direction by 80 percent. At the same time, we increased the export of cars to some countries by almost 300 percent. Somewhat strange interest in European cars of Russian neighbors. And it is not a senseless idea to imagine that these cars were imported and then re -exported.

Our companies were obliged to execute decisions, but we cannot impose our will of India or Indian companies. If, thanks to our marginal limitation of prices for Russian Nafta, India can buy it cheaper - it is good, the Russians will get less monetary, ”Borrel said.

He stated this in Brussels during a press conference following the results of EU administrative administrations, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"Anyone who is really interested in peace cannot put aggressor and victim to a single level. I conveyed this message to all leaders in the world, especially who say that they are very interested in peace but continue to put the signs between the aggressor and his victim. The approach cannot bring peace that will be fair and cannot ensure that the Ukrainian people respect for its rights, "Borrel stressed.
According to him, everyone wants to end the war.
"The only one who wants to continue this war is Putin. And no one wants peaceful than Ukraine. That is why we support the initiative of the President of Zelensky's Just a Just Peace," the EU High Representative said.

In the first stage, the team projected the foundation of the future school, but subsequently the construction process was stopped due to massive missile shelling of Ukraine, lack of power supply unstable weather conditions. Therefore, only in May, the 3D-printer and the active phase of the work were brought.According to the concept of the project, which was created by the Kiev Balbek Bureau Workshop, it erects a single -storey building with a height of 3.5m and an area of 506 square meters. There will be classes, teaching, foyer, corridors and bathrooms. The total budget is $ 800.

 The Zhytomyr Polytechnic University is developing a generator -cold plasma that will be used for the treatment of wounds and sterilization of medical tools.
Roman Kolomiets, a teacher of the Faculty of Information and Computer Technologies, told the Ukrinform correspondent.
"The development of cold plasma generator for medical use is ongoing. We focus on medicine, although such generators are used, in particular, in the food industry. The principle of its work is that a tall voltage, approximately 20 thousand volts, the air is ionized, and ions - a ceno aggregate state of a substance - plasma. It is the ions kill bacteria. Advantage is that the bacterium does not produce immunity to it. When we are ossified antibiotics against bacteria, they do not destroy them by 100%, because bacteria produce immunity and mutate. As for viruses, the efficiency of cold plasma generator has not been proven, ”Kolomiets said.
 According to the scientist, this method began to develop in the world about 10 years. Cost of cold plasma generators in and the US is too high, and the development of Zhytomyr Polytechnic is focused on it to be lower and acceptable to the Ukrainian consumer.
Currently, the university has already created the third prototype of such a generator, which is planned to improve.

 MRC Typhon Missile Set. Photo: US Army.
At the beginning of 2023, the Lockheed Martin Concern officially handed over the US Army a prototype battery kit MRC Typhon. In this way, the lifted states took another step in the direction of deployment of missile system systems - those who were banned in 1987 by a medium and shorter -range pro -receptacle contract(Rcmd). З нього фактично вийшла росія(Having taken the winged rocket for the Iskander complex. - Ed.), respectively, and the US did not see the point in compliance with the provisions of this document. 
About the recent American rocket system of the Army Correspondent tells the investigator of weapons and military equipment, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professional Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sagaidachnya Andnyi Haruk. 
 Andriy Haruk. Photo from A. Haruk's personal archive
- Andriy Ivanovich, what became the prehistory of the creation of this type of weapon? 
-The RSMD contract prohibited the deployment of land base missiles with a range of 500-2500 km, but did not limit the same weapon of maritime base. The US, having destroyed the winged landscapes of the land base BGM-109G GLCM "Griffin", successfully developed a marine analogue-Tomahawk missiles. That is, for the deployment of non -name KR it was necessary to take only one step - to create an appropriate ground -free plant.
And the Americans went the easiest way: installed on the corresponding chassis of "half" the module of the ship's vertical start-up MK 41. In the shipbuilding, such a module contains eight rockets, and in terrestrial-only four. The predicted use(TPK)four types - MK 14 mod 2(For “tomatovs”), Mk 21 mod 3(For missiles SM-6 BLOCK I), MK 21MOD 4(For missiles SM-6 BLOCK IA)і Mk 29 mod 1(For SM-6 Block IB missiles). Стартвідбувається «гарячим» способом — з пуском двигуна ракети (start -up -wrapping)Inside TPK.
- Are there any features in the layout and application of these installations and in the chowons specifically? Start from Typhon, unlike the griffin, is carried out vertically, and not dedicated. Another difference is the presence of only one BKP on the battery. Griffin in the Griffin, the battery consisted of four PU and two BCPs divided by the subsoil sections. Theoretically, this provided greater flexibility of use, but no significance.

"Griffins" carried a constant combat duty in storage hangers(in Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Belgium)And in the case of anxiety, they had to make a starter from the base, immediately after leaving the hangars. They used only thermo -fusion warheads(W84 adjustable power - from 0.3 to 150 kW), the adity of the start reached 2500 km. But "typhoid" is not even seen as a carrier weapon.
*!
-MRC's abbreviation means MID-Range Capability-that is, "the ability of the average radius." Typhon should take a place between the promising missile systems ofPRSM and LRHW. The first one is ATCMS substitute, but twice as lighter, with a range of 500 km(And in the future - 650 and even 1000 km). Друга — це гіперзвуковаракета з дальністю пуску 2775 км.
Для «Тифона» дальність пуску окреслюється в 1000-1100 миль (Approximately 1,600-1800 km)ie he will compete with the OpFires system(range approximately 1000 miles). Загальна кількість «Тифонів», що буде придбана для армії, поки неоголошувалась. Вважається, що вона може сягнути 15 батарей (5 tribal dysons).

- Andriy Ivanovich, what can you tell about the missiles for this complex? With the second type of rockets is more difficult. The fact is that SM-6, it is RIM-174, is a cesuitous rocket, a representative of a very large family of "Standard" missiles. SM-6 Block Ia is currently relocated now(RIM-174A). Він використовуєкорпус і двигуни (Starting and marching)SM-2ER Block IV missiles(RIM-156A), Aleks a new guidance system at the final stage is an active radar, zanten, similar to the one used in the AIM-120C Amraam Air-Air Air missile.
US Navy officially do not serve SM-6 Block IA firing, and for SM-2rBlock IV outlines this parameter in a very wide range-100-200 nautical miles(185-370km). Для SM-6 Block IА «гуляє» цифра 460 км, але вона малоймовірна,враховуючи, що двигуни на цій ракеті аналогічні SM-2ER Block IV, а сама вонанавіть трохи важча (1497 kg instead of 1466). До того ж SM-6 Block IА шаленодорога — 14 млн доларів за одиницю (Only more expensive SM-3block IIA anti-fabal rocket-it costs more than 45 million!- avt. ). Для порівняння: ракети«Томагавк» Block V за грудневим контрактом купуються десь по 1,54 млн заштуку. Тобто SM-6 Block IА — це зброя, яка не може бути масовою.
 The use of such rockets for land firing is theoretically possible, but practically - meaningless. Yes, they have a small lid time in view of supersonic speed, but the mass of the combat unit - only 63.5 kg. In short, the inclusion of SM-6 in Typhon's ammunition raises more questions than answers.
- And are there any special requirements for the chassis on which the LRF complex is mounted?

_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
We have already started cooking this and in the coming weeks. We expect new meetings and intervals, as long as it is to visit us, to our country. There will be more weapons for our soldiers.
We add content to Ukraine weekly from the summit in Vilnius. We do our best to make the summit for us exactly the one that works. Let's see, but that is less, we are working on it.
By the way, today there is an important declaration from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Things are named by their names - a clear recognition of the genocide of Russia's crimes against our state, a clear condemnation of Rashist ideology. This is the right basis for other international organizations.
We are preparing for several intermediate security measures in the neighboring countries-those that support us most. There will be new appeals for the sake of understanding the world of Ukraine, for the sake of strengthening our connections with partners.
And such intense foreign policy, various non -standard formats, maximum useful attention of the world to Ukraine, to our defense - we will be all. Each time there are more results for Ukraine - air defense, artillery, armored vehicles, shells, training - all this is a must.
I want to thank all our soldiers today who protect the sky. About the evening until this morning, 25 "Shahmed" was shot down. 25 out of 25.Development. And every such confusion is the saved lives of people, it is an infrastructure. Thank you!
Some of the terrorists' missiles have also managed, but unfortunately, not all. Unfortunately, drilling.

In his opinion, the meeting in Japan became without exaggeration by a historical event. The G7 summit of the G7 summit took place, which was preceded by the large -scale official meetings of President Vladimir Zelensky at the Asian continent and in the so -called Arab world.
Assessing the results of communication of the Ukrainian delegation with the members of the international organization of the Great Seven countries, Fedor Venislavsky named the main acquisition of such meetings in Hiroshima called a joint decision on providing Ukraine aircraft-16 with the relevant preliminary training of Ukrainian military pilots. The supervision of a member of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, Taxation of G7 countries is a clear testimony that the Ukrainian state has to join the most powerful, developed countries in the world.
 - The training of Ukrainian pilots on these fighters is the long -lasting - the de -time of the months, and repeats the track that we watched in the case of a "tank coalition" when military specialists were initially studied, and then the equipment was transmitted. I am convinced that this year Ukraine will receive not only flyers!- said Fedor Venislavsky. -In addition to the F-16, the armed forces of Ukraine will be transferred to the rockets of high radius, the air defense system and, of course, what the Ukrainian pre-resident, military leadership, was repeatedly insisted on. These are ammunition and artillery systems of large range and more. Together, all this indicates that the generalized world, in particular, the most powerful economies of the world support the taboda to support Ukraine in the future, - said Fedor Venislavsky.Answering questions about the plans of Ukraine's participation in the NATO summit, which is planned for July this year in Vilnius, Fedor Venislavsky noted that the Ukrainian state for full membership in the Alliance is no longer necessarily to receive a MAP(NATO Membership Action Plan).
— Україна, її Збройні Сили вже виконали переважну більшість тих вимог, якізазвичай висуваються країнам-кандидатам. Після деокупації територій таостаточної перемоги над російським агресором Україна розраховує на швидкупроцедуру прийняття в родину НАТО, — заявив Федір Веніславський.

 Most people who have survived sexual violence by the invaders are told about this. Sexual violence remains a "hidden crime" that lends a deep injury that destroys the fate of people, families and whole communities. It is not easy to violence on sexual grounds, it is a conscious policy of hostile state directed to intimidation, demoralization, humiliation of the dignity of our civilian population. The GPU and the Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin have made this topics wide professional and public discussion. It is for this type of crime that it is important. After all, on our common position and attitude to victimsual violence, depends on whether they turn to the law enforcement agencies of those who are still hesitant or ashamed. We all have to protect them together for punishment not only of performers, but also those who form a chubin policy, ”Anna Malyar wrote.
