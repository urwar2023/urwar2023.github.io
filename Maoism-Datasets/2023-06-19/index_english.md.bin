About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/protydiyadezinformatsiyi.cpd/posts/pfbid0qJC3TuG7LnUzw9xWTSWoezh9V6eJZugRFGmmWLew7mQJyQ8UquLErrBMFQw8RBU1l)On its official Facebook page the Center for Combating Misinformation.

The plot shows the positions of the Russian military. They comment on ammunition and drones, as well as telling how these means of impressions are used against the Armed Forces.

The French report showed an unsuccessful example of "neutral journalism" as it is not in this war, where it is clearly clear who is the aggressor and the terrorist.

Thus, the TF1 TV channel deliberately promotes the narrative about the "power of Russian army" and discredits Ukraine, showing that it is possible to bypass the Ukrainian -law on the side of the enemy, - summarized in the CPD.

Про це повідомляє офіційний [ сайт ](https://uaf.ua/article/48572)Ukrainian Football Association(Waf), reports Ukrinform.

\- It is difficult to spend three games in 10 days. We knew that this meeting would be very weighted. As in the last match, they spent the second half more confidently. The main thing was to get three points and move on.

** \- everyone expected a more confident victory. This Ukraine has played worse, templag, did Malta deserve praise? **

\- It is very difficult for us to play with such teams, because they have a very compact defense. I realized that it would be so that in the second half we will play better than the stubborn. They spent a lot of strength, pressed a lot, so there was a much better game in the second half of the meeting. I expected it. We always play hard against such saturated defense. Many moments were crucified in the second half. Yes, they had to score more. I know that in Ukraine everyone is waiting for 5-0, 6-0, but now all teams can defend themselves.

** \- Why did you decide not to include in the application for the Kochergin and Rusyn match? **

\- because we have to have 23 players, someone has to stay out of application.

** \- Do you consider Matvienko's output in the starting liner? **

\- I don't know what mistakes are. I look at how ready the players are home to, how they play for their clubs, I analyze. As you can see, Mykolenko is not a grave time. This is his first two matches after the injury. I planned to release it in the second half. I think he has increased the level of our game in the attack.

** \- Maybe it was worth trying sable on the position of the left defender instead of mattresses? **

\- I love all the players, but I get away from statistics, I look who is better. We have competition at every position, so I choose who will play. This is normal.

** \- Of course, it is too early to demand something from the national team of Ukraine. How do you think why are so difficult to win over rivals like Malta? **** Read also: ** [The national team of Ukraine beat Malta in selection for Euro-2024](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-sports/3725020-zbirna-ukraini-obigrala-maltu-u-vidbori-na-evro2024.html)** \- Do you plan to attend youth Euro-2023 matches? **

\- Yes, I plan to come to Bucharest. Tomorrow, my assistants are Gomez and Gleb Platov. I will come for a second or third game. This is a very important tournament. I wish our team success so that we get to the Olympics. From the giving of the players, I talked to them, they want to play for the youth. No one said he wanted to relax on the eve of the euro. They have made the all. I am sure that these players will help our "youth".

** \- What should we expect from the September matches of the national team of Ukraine? **

\- We now met with Germany, showed a decent game. The next gaming will be official, we need to prepare seriously for any duels. We have always set a goal before - getting out of the group.

** \- How do you appreciate the Tsygankov game, which have already been appointed team leader? How did you determine who would beat the second penalty? **

\- Victor himself set himself as the leader of the team. No one appointed him. What he does in the last three matches is his merit. Before the game, we determined that Yarmolenko would beat the penalty. But after the unsuccessful performance of the former, I saw that he himself suggested that Tsygankov punch. I understood that Andrew was not psychologically ready for the second penalty. Therefore, I am grateful to Tsygankov for showing that he was ready for it.

This is evidenced by an anonymous survey of Ukrainians who have used the services of employment services for the second year, Ukrinform reports with reference [Delfi](https://www.delfi.lt/be/news/live/sluzhba-zanyatosti-34-ukrainskih-voennyh-bezhencev-v-buduschem-planiruyut-zhit-i-rabotat-v-litve.d?id=93698967).

The survey conducted in May showed that most of the refugees will be set by women aged 30-40 years(83,2%)of which more than half(52,5%)- with higher education. Most Ukrainians noted that the Lithuanians have taken them pure very well(97%). Цього року збільшилася кількість тих, хто не визначився зпланами на майбутнє, пов'язаними з життям у [ Литві](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-litva) (40%), минулого року таких було 32%.

Литовська Служба зайнятості сприяє інтеграції українців у ринок праці,компенсуючи частину заробітної плати працедавцям, які їх працевлаштували. Зпочатку цього року 1400 біженців з України почали брати участь у програмісубсидованого працевлаштування. За даними опитування, 89,1% опитаних українцівзадоволені наданими Службою зайнятості послугами (Compared to the last year data, this score improved by 3.4%).

53,5% респондентам, які брали участь в опитуванні, вдалося працевлаштуватися.Більшість стверджує, що умови праці їх задовольняють, хоча половина опитанихукраїнців хотіли б вищої зарплати. 89% респондентів зазначили, що спілкуванняу робочому середовищі відбувається добре чи дуже добре.

This was stated by a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov, reports Ukrinform with reference to [GUR.](http://gur.gov.ua/content/obraz-putina-iakyi-osobysto-rozpovidaie-pro-podii-v-ukrainy-naivazhchyi-narkotyk-dlia-rosiiskoi-propahandy.html)He noted that “most Russian applications are focused on the internal audience. In particular, the statement about "5 destroyed Patriot complexes".

“For Ukraine and our partners, it is an obvious lie because we are in comprehensive communication with allies. But for the average, there is no value, the Russian dictator "five" or "fifty" would say, - explained.

“This means that even the internal audience no longer perceives as the truth of the last instance of endless horses, nightingale and scabbies. That is, there is already a drug of the drug, ”Yusov said.

In his opinion, "Putin's image, who personally" runs "about events in Ukraine is the most important drug for Russian propaganda."

"And then there will be a break and a void," Yusov said.

He also hinted at what the chief of GUR Kirill Budanov was silent.

According to Yusov, “it is a matter of operations that are planned, implemented and devoured and brought to life. Some of them are happening now - literally this time. ”

"The results of these operations - they will see," the intelligence representative emphasized, adding that Budanov is in a "wonderful working mood and reacts with Naproian fakes about him with a characteristic branded laughter."

About it writes [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-howitzers-contracts.html)With reference to Ukrainian and Western officials, reports Ukrinform.

“We had occasions when we paid money but did not receive(weapons - ed.)»,- quotes the newspaper of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr Gavrilov.

According to him, the government analyzed the procurement during the past, and excluded problematic contractors from further work. Two people who participated in the execution of armed contracts for Ukraine reported that the shortage was subsequently delivered and in other cases brokers returned.

The publication calls the "crazy" volumes of western supplies [weapons](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zbroa)In Ukraine, it notes that problems are inevitable.

In particular, some of the platforms that went to Ukraine were unsuitable, although the documents indicated that weapons were ready for combat insurance. Some samples only agreed to spare parts for other systems. The editions, now about 30% of the Armed Forces, are renovated, which is a high indicator for a country that leads active contradiction.

One examples of problematic deliveries are the transfer of 33 self -propelled Goubitsyitalian government.

In Italy, it was confirmed that these machines needed major repairs, which was supported by the US contractor Ultra Defense Corporation. However, when the first batch of restored cars received the when they were "unusable for combat missions", the newspaper quoted the official document of the Ministry of Defense.

In Kiev, they complained about poor repair work, and from this drive the Pentagon opened an investigation.

"There were problems with the quality of some howitzers, but the Mipovin keep in mind that it was a gift," Gaavrilov said in this connection.** Read also: ** [on Kakhovskaya HPP could undermine underwater passage -investigation NYT](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3724222-na-kahovskij-ges-mogli-pidirvati-pidvodnij-prohid-rozsliduvanna-nyt.html)In a short time, contractors repaired transmission, replaced batteries, eliminated liquid leaks, broken lights, etc. and stated that all 29 machines are ready for references to Ukraine. However, when the cars reached Poland, it was found that 25 of them were rotten. It took almost a month to find sufficient tires for replacement, which "delayed the delivery of other equipment to Ukraine, it took considerable effort and time," the Pentagon's report said.

A similar situation happened with the howits of the M777, which should have been sent in Ukraine a few weeks after the start of a full -scale invasion. As it seemed, they "needed serious maintenance", and one was in such a bad condition that "killed someone" while using it.

In January, the Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom, Ben Volles announced the planned transmission of self-propelled howitzers AS-90, including those who were in "varying degrees of readiness". Twelve of them needed either recovery or use for spare parts, according to a statement by the British Defense Ministry.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-19T17-56-00-03-00/630_360_1668589929-696.jpg)NATO Secretary -General Jens Stoltenberg has named three priorities for the guarantee of Western democracies for the following decades, among which the first one is to continue assistance to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.

He stated this today during a speech to the German business at a conference on the occasion of the German Industry Day, Ukrinform reports.

“We are now experiencing a critical moment for our safety. In the future, the competition between the great world forces is growing. Our values and democracy are undergoing pressure, President Putin has returned the war to Europe again. After the Clothes War, we all hoped for peaceful relations with Russia. Gradually, the cards were dispelled as a result of an aggressive tendency in Presidential's behavior, ”said NATO leader.

He recalled that such a trend was manifested during the Russian invasion of a group, in the actions of the Russian army in Syrian Aleppo, in the Russian aggression of Broad and in the Donbass. A full-scale invasion of Ukraine has finally curtailed any illusions that could remain about the possibility of constructive work with Russia, the Secretary General emphasized.

What we do or do not do now will determine our safety for the next anniversary, ”Stoltenberg said.

He emphasized the three main purposes, which should concentrate the Western Democracies to respond to the challenges coming from the more dangerous world.

“The first. We must continue to support Ukraine. NATO has helped Ukraine since 2014 and provided unprecedented assistance during the past year. Germany has a significant contribution to this work, transferring Ukraine's air protection, combat tanks, artillery and ammunition. This assistance increases the ability of Ukraine to fight on the battlefield and return their territories, and they can return more. We must continue to give them everything to help them as a sovereign and independent state. This is our immediate task, ”the NATO Secretary General has announced.“Second, we must continue to strengthen our defense. After the Russian has exposed a full -scale invasion of Ukraine, it was much better understanding why it is necessary - not to provoke a conflict, anavpaki - to preserve peace. It costs money. Therefore, NATO leaders of the next month in Vilnius will determine 2 percent of GDP as a minimum level of defense costs, ”Stoltenberg said.

** Read also: ** [Cooleba - ** Stoltenberg ** U: It is important to make a free -to -NATO membership in NATO, eliminating VAT](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3723626-kuleba-stoltenbergu-vazlivo-zrobiti-u-vilnusi-krok-do-clenstva-ukraini-v-nato-usunuvsi-pdc.html)He congratulated Germany's intention to reach this defense budget at 2 percent of GDP as early as 2024 and put a separate emphasis on the need to strengthen the potential of the defense industry of the event.

“Our stocks(weapons and ammunition - ed.)Evaporated, so they must be filled, not only in Germany, but in many countries around NATO. Production is the key to continue assistance to Ukraine and to ensure our defense, ”said the Alliance head.

The third main direction of security, in his opinion, is the cesaosa -running of the excessive dependence of Western democracies on resources that come from totalitarian states.

“A few months ago, many believed that gas purchases from Russia were an adversative solution. We all found out, and in a difficult way that it is also amazing. … Germany and other European countries have carried out huge sakes for diversification of energy supply. We do not have to make the same mistake with other totalitarian regimes, ”Stoltenberg said.

He noted that this, in particular, concerns the avoidance of excessive dependence of raw materials and semiconductors from China, increasing the control of double -use European technologies, which can be used by the way against Europe and the West itself.

This was stated by Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau on Monday while opening the meeting of ambassadors in Warsaw, Ukrinform reports, citing [Polish Radio](https://www.polskieradio.pl/398/7856/Artykul/3192131,%D0%B7%D0%B1%D1%96%D2%91%D0%BD%D1%94%D0%B2-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%83-%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%96%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5).

Зокрема, глава МЗС зазначив, що від початку війни проти України Захід ставитьсобі, зокрема, питання про її кінець, про значення ядерного шантажу з бокупрезидента Росії. За словами Рау, “хоча ці питання залишаються без відповіді,слід підкреслити, що поки жодна стратегічна мета Кремля не досягнута, алевійна вплинула на безпрецедентну співпрацю між Україною та НАТО”.

The head of Kryvyi Rih City Military Administration Alexandervkul reported in [telegram](http://t.me/vilkul/3616), reports Ukrinform.

"Can we not save water? No. Otherwise, it will be guaranteed to end the week. Through strict savings, we have a chance to reach the implementation of waters," Vilkul said.

According to his [words](http://t.me/vilkul/3614)To compensate for the receipts lost due to Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power supplies, 11 million cubic meters per month is required(up to 380 thousand cubic meters per day - taking into account the consumption of a city, rural district and evaporation from the Southern "reservoir"). Післяруйнування Каховської ГЕС та обміління водосховища без дніпровської водизалишилося 2/3 Криворізької агломерації - приблизно 550 тисяч людей із 800тисяч жителів.

У транзитному Південному водосховищі води залишилося трохи більше ніж намісяць. Начальник МВА [ наголосив ](http://t.me/vilkul/3615)To take water can only from the Karachuny reservoir, and to transfer from other reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade, which is higher. Currently, four technical solutions for providing the city and nearby villages with water are being implemented. But it takes time, money, materials, so there is a risk that two -thirds of the city will remain water. The most critical period is September-October.

According to its words, this contributes to the maximum reduction of water supply to industrial enterprises, the ban on work of sinks, a ban on irrigation from hoses, a decrease in a living sector, the work of a water utility from 22.00 to 5.00 only in regimening.

With regard to the work of the car wash, the chief VS noted that the violators prohibited sanctions.

"Many businessmen have heard us and stopped the washing of cars. There are dishonest ones that have not been switched off and even disrupted the valves with the valves.As reported by Ukrinform, on the night of June 6, Russian troops undermined the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, causing the flooding of part of the Kherson Tamikolaiv regions and at the same time - a critical measuring of the Kakhovsky Dam.

“Opening of seaports of Ukraine for all types of goods is required for Ukrainian [economy](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ekonomika).

Kubrakov emphasized that now the work of the "grain initiative" is actually stopped - the Russians openly sabotage inspections of ships, the capacity of the corridor - less

This leads to significant losses not only from Ukraine: the world has not received at least 20 million tonnes of agricultural products because of a grain agreement.

As it was reported, in early June, Russia resumed registration of the incoming navy by violation of the sustainable algorithm of registration and inspection of ships. In particular, on June 4, the Russian side registered 2 incoming vessels, which were declared in the Grain Initiative on the same day. This is contrary to the accepted rules of inspection of ships, which provide that the first time the check is performed, who are waiting for the longest time.

\- It is difficult to spend three games in 10 days. We knew that this meeting would be very weighted. As in the last match, they spent the second half more confidently. The main thing was to get three points and move on.

** \- everyone expected a more confident victory. This Ukraine has played worse, templag, did Malta deserve praise? **

\- It is very difficult for us to play with such teams, because they have a very compact defense. I realized that it would be so that in the second half we will play better than the stubborn. They spent a lot of strength, pressed a lot, so there was a much better game in the second half of the meeting. I expected it. We always play hard against such saturated defense. Many moments were crucified in the second half. Yes, they had to score more. I know that in Ukraine everyone is waiting for 5-0, 6-0, but now all teams can defend themselves.

** \- Why did you decide not to include in the application for the Kochergin and Rusyn match? **

\- because we have to have 23 players, someone has to stay out of application.

** \- Do you consider Matvienko's output in the starting liner? **

\- I don't know what mistakes are. I look at how ready the players are home to, how they play for their clubs, I analyze. As you can see, Mykolenko is not a grave time. This is his first two matches after the injury. I planned to release it in the second half. I think he has increased the level of our game in the attack.

** \- Maybe it was worth trying sable on the position of the left defender instead of mattresses? **

\- I love all the players, but I get away from statistics, I look who is better. We have competition at every position, so I choose who will play. This is normal.

** \- Of course, it is too early to demand something from the national team of Ukraine. How do you think why are so difficult to win over rivals like Malta? **** Read also: ** [The national team of Ukraine beat Malta in selection for Euro-2024](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-sports/3725020-zbirna-ukraini-obigrala-maltu-u-vidbori-na-evro2024.html)** \- Do you plan to attend youth Euro-2023 matches? **

\- Yes, I plan to come to Bucharest. Tomorrow, my assistants are Gomez and Gleb Platov. I will come for a second or third game. This is a very important tournament. I wish our team success so that we get to the Olympics. From the giving of the players, I talked to them, they want to play for the youth. No one said he wanted to relax on the eve of the euro. They have made the all. I am sure that these players will help our "youth".

** \- What should we expect from the September matches of the national team of Ukraine? **

\- We now met with Germany, showed a decent game. The next gaming will be official, we need to prepare seriously for any duels. We have always set a goal before - getting out of the group.

** \- How do you appreciate the Tsygankov game, which have already been appointed team leader? How did you determine who would beat the second penalty? **

\- Victor himself set himself as the leader of the team. No one appointed him. What he does in the last three matches is his merit. Before the game, we determined that Yarmolenko would beat the penalty. But after the unsuccessful performance of the former, I saw that he himself suggested that Tsygankov punch. I understood that Andrew was not psychologically ready for the second penalty. Therefore, I am grateful to Tsygankov for showing that he was ready for it.

The main question in this context is spare parts. The second is the training of personnel. And yet-the work of organizing the repair of weapons and equipment in Ukraine or in the territory of adjacent Ukrainian partners. According to our plan, rapid ongoing repairs are done at our territory, complex repairs-at the production facilities of partner countries. But adjustments are made in time. When there is a lot of techniques and there is a constant need for repayment, repair of varying complexity, it is desirable that there is a maximum of usability in our territory. Because, given the active dynamic action, the time for the repair of equipment should be minimized as possible. The work on the repair of military equipment is organized, relatively speaking, with some lines. The first, second and third line is the performance of repair works of Ukrainian. The most difficult breakdowns or damage require evacuation to the capacity of the manufacturers abroad,-said Gavrilov.

** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!**

Report for this day.

Rate. Priority - advanced, specific issues of offensive. There were reporters and commanders directly from the directions of fighting. Also reporting Committee, Head of GUR.

Separately and in detail they considered the preparation and provision of new brigade Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time for combat actions.

In some directions, our warriors move forward, in some directions protect positions and oppose storms and increased attacks of the invaders. There will be lost positions. Only released. They have only losses. And in general-the pressure of pressure, our pressure, which allows you to pave the path of our flag. Syno-yellow colors will be throughout our south and throughout our east. Bommies are on their land, and it gives the greatest power.

I thank all our soldiers - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer of every general who is attracted to our active offensive and defensives now. I thank you for every liberated and for every protected position!

Today, in a conversation with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rice Sunak, defense needs as a time, thanked for the defense support. For example, the British "Sidewht" - long -range missiles - make a very useful and accurate business at the front. Like many other weapons. And this cooperation will be a significant continuation.

Of course, they discussed with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister, preparing a NATO Vilnius summit and a meaningful filling of this Alliance meeting.They discussed with Rishi and the preparation of the Conference on Reconstruction of Ukraine - the conference of Vlondon. These days, it will take place, and we expect from it consolidation of different international efforts, including big business, in support of our restoration. Recovery that must be demonstrated to the world, which is freedom.

Both the conference and financial cooperation and our movement in the EU have discussed Ursula Der Lyen with the presidential community. Already this week we are expecting an intermediate oral evaluation of our work on the recommendations of the European Commission. And discussed in detail, the 11th sanctional package against Russia for the war.

He also spoke with the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte Tapremier, Denmark, Matte Frederixen. As always, they paid attention to the forefront and our joint defense efforts, thanked for their support for the readiness to develop our cooperation for the sake of security.

He informed about negotiations with the leaders and representatives of the African states, which were in Ukraine and then visited the terrorist state. Every international step is only convinced that the world should be more active in the world with the formula of peace. Because only this formula is quite comprehensively reacting for the aspect of Russian madness.

And one more.

The World Bank. He spoke to the Bank President today. And not only about cooperation, but also about the post -war transformation of Ukraine. About those decisions and about the timber, about the new doctrine of the new Ukraine, Ukraine, which wins - steps that we will prepare and implement. All together. As together as we now overcome thisaggression.

Thank you all who are in battle now, in combat posts, in combat positions!

Especially today I will note the assault unit of GRU "Artan" and its commander Torkotyuk. Thank you!

And yet - our special operations. Victor, all the guys - thank you very much!

** Thank you all who are fighting and working for the sake of Ukraine!**

**Glory to Ukraine!**

Currently, Ukraine does not practice sending official requests to the Russian side of specific prisoners of war, because it "overestimates the price" of such prisoners.

About it [the one was talking](https://t.me/Koord_shtab/1270)During the meeting of the Hardware Headquarters on the Defense of Prisoners of Pursuing.

Native prisoners of war were interested in the process of confirming the stay of captivity not only with the help of ICRC representatives, but also the outfit requests of the Ukrainian side.

“We cannot do this, because it is, in simple words, to overestimate the price of such people. That is, the Russian side, having received a similar request, has understood the increased attention to one or another captive and requires special conditions for his liberation, ”the expert explained.

Relatives of prisoners and missing defenders were also interested in the issue of prisoners of prisoners from maintenance in Russia or temporary -corresponding territories. The headquarters representative reported that in the event that a terrorist condemns Ukrainian prisoners under a criminal article, such people are often moved between different colonies.

At the meeting, they paid attention to the practice of releasing mobile SIM-card with Ukrainian mobile operators due to prolonged non-use of a specific SIM card with a subscriber.

According to the relatives of the defenders, in the event that such cards belong to the missing or disadvantaged servicemen, their rewelr complicates the process of searching for persons.

It should be noted that in March 2022, FIL forbade Russia and Belarus to participate in tournaments under its auspices in response to a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.

When meeting with people returning from the front, it is important to show the care of tasseling instead of pathos through flowers, orchestras and applause. It will help you feel the sincerity of your feelings and experiences.

About it [reports](https://t.me/militarymediacenter/2281)Military Mediacenter.

** Respect those who have come back from the front. **

* You need to be prepared for the fact that a person who has gone to war can significantly change their life principles and views. It can also be expected that after the war it can change its attitude to material assets. * It is necessary to prepare the relatives of the military for the arrival of their loved ones from the front. Relatives should have information conversations in advance in order to know how to act in order not to cause injuries to soldiers in the family circle and how to support them in society during the adaptation period. * It is important to give the military time to deal with the issues of arriving from the front. If they are at rest, they will be able to resolve business issues and will not bring their weapons to home where there are children and will avoid conflicts with management in the future. This will allow them to relax after rotation. * It is important to learn how to critically perceive information when a native person is at the front. You should not trust the fighting information that comes from unverified sources, and you should not panic relatives at the front without evidence. * It is important to tell the fighters at the front that everything is well at home, as it is important for them to know that relatives have peace and peace.

** What don't need to do? **

* Avoid conflicts and negative emotions that can return the military to the past in the war. * Do not try to understand the reality in which warriors live. * Do not ask about the dead brothers if the military does not want to talk about it. * Do not download household chores. Limit the military from family household cases for several months - be independent in solving tricky issues. * Limit conversations about the war and are not interested in the course of the fighting and the place of stay of the fighters, as it can create additional stress for them.

** In order not to be confused and panic during evacuation, parents remember some simple rules: ** **

1. Hold the baby only by the hand. If your baby holds you by a sleeve or a bag, it can be very easy to get lost in the crowd. 2. Walking to the destination in the crowd, lead the children in front of you. 3. Always carry a picture of your baby with you(In particular, on the phone), preferably fresh. If the baby is lost, the picture of passers -by is easier to remember and help you find quickly.

** How to prepare for evacuation: **

1. Teach your child to know their own name, age, parents' names, home address, and, if possible, one parent contact number. 2. Sign her things. Indicate the contact person and phone number. 3. Additionally, put a business card with information about the contact person, copies of birth certificate and parents' passport data.

** How to act if you found a lost baby: **

1. Find out the name of the child and where she is. Ask when she saw her parents or other adult who was with her. 2. Take the baby to a safe place. 3. Call a line 102 immediately, it may be already looking for relatives.

“Most Russian applications are focused on an internal audience. In particular, the statement on "5 destroyed complexes" Patriot ". For Ukraine and our partners, it is a clear lie because we are in a dense communication with the allies. But for the average enlightened it is irrelevant, it would say [the Russian dictator] "five" or "fifty", - said Andrei Yusov.

The representative of Ukraine's military intelligence noted that the "Ukrainian counter -offensive" is increasingly commented on person or a person similar to Putin or Shoigu.

“This means that even the internal audience no longer perceives as the truth of the last instance of endless horses, nightingales and scabbies. That is, some drug is already highly. The image of Putin, who personally "bursts" the proceedings in Ukraine is the most difficult drug for Russian propaganda. And what further will be a break and a void, ”Andrey Yusov said.

Also, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence hinted at which the chief of the MO Kirill Budanov is silent:

“[It is about the operations that are planned, implemented and will soon be put to life. Some of them are happening right now - literally at this time. The results of these operations - they will see, ”Andrei Yusov said, adding that Shkirilo Budanov is in a wonderful working mood and reacts to Russian traffic about him with a characteristic branded laughter.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-19T92-00-00-04-00/malyar-1-960x540-1.jpg)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar on the broadcasting of the Teleterna "Unified News" was about the actions of the occupiers in different directions and the insidiousness of the Russian propaganda.

- It is difficult for our defenders to move forward. After all, the enemy is carefully prepared and resistance. If we talk about the South, then our armed forces are faced with a continuous mining. The invaders also use drones-Kamikadze Taptrk. Here you need to understand that the enemy will not be easy to give their positions. And it is not necessary to measure our performance only kilometers or number of settlements. The ongoing operation has several tasks, and our tasks are fulfilling these tasks. So the greatest results are ahead, ”Anna Malyar reported.

She also stopped on the plans of the Russians, which are viewed in their actions along the entire front of the front.

- The invaders do not leave their key purpose, which they have defined, and this is the river of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. At a time when they were unable to seize Kiev, they simply began to set goals gradually. Despite the fact that now the directions in the south continue the offensive of our armed forces, the Russians also have an extent of the offensive. Let's say in the east they were on four directions: Marinsky, Avdiivsky, Lymansky and Bakhmutsky. East, in fact, is the main direction of their offensive. They really charge their reserves in the number of shelling. Therefore, when we hear in the news that the intensity of hostilities is alleged, it should be understood that it is really hot, ”said Anna Malyar.

She added that in the Kupyansk and Liman directions of the Defense forces of Ukraine, the Ukraine was kept defense and did not give any meters of land.

- In some areas we are in the offensive, and in others - in defense. The enemy is very serious, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

It also stopped at the enemy's information attacks and the causes of nuclear themes in the rhetoric of Kremlin propagandists.

So, the enemy 555 times struck from different types of artillery. Twice tried to fade us. There were also 5 aircraft. During the reflection of the enemy attacle, 35 invaders were destroyed and 43 more were injured. We also destroyed the tank-62, one SAU and two cars. At the same time, the T-62 tank is long outdated specification, and this indicates a lack of armored vehicles,-said Sergiycheriev.

From the clarification that the Russians constantly have serious problems with the personnel. After all, our warriors quickly destroy enemies.

- Lack of living power is the main problem of Russians. Therefore, they use a mixed group, which includes motor -rifle units, hypersonant, and units of the military reserve, as well as territorial troops. It is worth saying that in this direction, they have been pulling the storm detachments "storm-Z", which consist of a prisoner. However, in Bakhmut, the Wagnerians were actually destroyed. The same is waiting for the Naprosian near the estuary and Kupyansk, - said the Armed Forces officer.

According to Colonel Sergei Cherevatov, in the Bakhmut direction there is a position.

- The number of combat clashes has decreased slightly. There were only three of them over the past 24 hours, and the enemy continues to be active in the artillery shelling near Bakhmut. The latter were 407 times. They also made 9 Avhalots. However, our artillery works very effectively on the enemy, which is not allowed to take rotational events. As a result, 85 invaders were destroyed, another 136 were injured, and we were captured by two. In addition, we have shot their Drontipe Zala and eliminated the Mur-P surveillance complex,-summed up the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/nemaye-u-derzhavi-zla-takih-fortifikacij-chi-rezerviv-yaki-z-83681)in your conversation.

"Rate. Priority - advanced, specific issues of offensive. There were reporters and commanders directly from the directions of fighting. Also reporting Committee, Head of GUR.

Separately and in detail they considered the preparation and provision of new brigade Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time for combat actions.

In some directions, our warriors move forward, in some directions protect positions and oppose storms and increased attacks of the invaders. There will be lost positions. Only released. They have only losses. And in general-the resolution of pressure, our pressure, which allows you to pave the path of our flag. Syno-yellow colors will be throughout our south and throughout our east. Bommy is on their land, and it gives the greatest power.

I thank all our soldiers - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer of every general who is attracted to our active offensive and defensives now. I thank you for every liberated and for every protected position!

Today, in a conversation with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rice Sunak, defense needs as a time, thanked for the defense support. For example, the British "Svedou" - long -range missiles - make a very useful and accurate business at the front. Like many other weapons. And this cooperation will be a significant continuation.

Of course, they discussed with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister, preparing a NATO Vilnius summit and a meaningful filling of this Alliance meeting.

Today, there is also a significant political decision of Britain on sanctions - to keep junctions against Russia, until the aggressor compensates for all the damage caused to our country, our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all persons associated with it are related to the system of domination built by the Kremlin territory . It will be fair, and I am grateful to the British who support us on the path of justice.Both the conference and financial cooperation and our movement in the EU have discussed Ursula Der Lyen with the presidential community. Already this week we are expecting an intermediate oral evaluation of our work on the recommendations of the European Commission. And discussed in detail, the 11th sanctional package against Russia for the war.

He also spoke with the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte Tapremier, Denmark, Matte Frederixen. As always, they paid attention to the forefront and our joint defense efforts, thanked for their support and readiness to develop our cooperation for the sake of safety, " - the message reads.

The President also informed about negotiations with the leaders and representatives of Africa, who were in Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that Svetuvarto is more active in working with the formula of peace. Because only this formula is sufficiently reacting to every aspect of Russian madness.

Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post -war transformation of Ukraine. About those decisions about those steps, about the new doctrine of the new Ukraine, which wins Ukraine, - the quotes that we prepare and implement. All together. Just as we now expose this aggression.

“Thank you all who are in battle now, in combat posts, in combat positions!

Especially today I will note the assault unit of GRU "Artan" and its commissarayor Torkotyuk. Thank you!

And yet - our special operations. Victor, all the guys - thank you very much!

Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!

Glory to Ukraine!" Said the President.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-20T98-00-00-04-00/site000327.png)The Government Response Team of Ukraine CERT-UA, which operates at the State Secretariat of Communications, warns of fraudulent activity against UKR.net users.

The attackers seem to be on behalf of technical support Ukr.net send electronic letters with the topic "noticed suspicious activity @ukr.net" and an additional form of the PDF file with the name "Safety Anti-Security"(Electronic addresse - [account.support.0@ukr.net)](mailto:account.support.0@ukr.net\)).

У PDF-документі користувачу погрожують блокуванням поштової скриньки тавимагають підтвердити доступ до поштового акаунту, перейшовши за посиланням.Насправді посилання спрямовує на шахрайський сайт, що імітує вебсторінкупоштового сервісу. У разі автентифікації на підробному вебсайті логін тапароль користувача будуть надіслані зловмисникам. Отже, сторонні особидістануть несанкціонований доступ до електронної поштової скриньки.

Фахівці CERT-UA вжили додаткових заходів з аналізу мережевої інфраструктури,що застосовується для здійснення аналогічних кібератак від 2021 року. Врезультаті виявили щонайменше 118 пов’язаних доменних імен, зареєстрованихкомпанією «Internet Domain Service BS Corp» (@Internet.bs, Bahamas).

Щоб мінімізувати вірогідність реалізації загроз щодо громадян України,ідентифіковані доменні імена додано до DNS RPZ зони, яка обслуговується CERT-UA. Також їх передано фахівцям CSIRT-NBU для внесення до DNS RPZ зони«шахрайство».

Активність відстежується за ідентифікатором UAC-0036 (The group is also known as Cold River, Callisto)and is carried out in the interests of the Special Service Federation.

CERT-UA experts recommend Ukr.net users:

* Do not move on suspicious links, * Set up multifactorial authentication * check what third -party devices / apps were accessed to the mailbox, and take other security enhancements.
