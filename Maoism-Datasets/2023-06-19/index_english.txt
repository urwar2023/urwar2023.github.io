 The TF-1 French TV channel showed a report filmed in the occupied Russian military territories of Ukraine. It does not say that Russia is the aggressor entered.
About it reports On its official Facebook page the Center for Combating Misinformation.
The plot shows the positions of the Russian military. They comment on ammunition and drones, as well as telling how these means of impressions are used against the Armed Forces.
The French report showed an unsuccessful example of "neutral journalism" as it is not in this war, where it is clearly clear who is the aggressor and the terrorist.
Thus, the TF1 TV channel deliberately promotes the narrative about the "power of Russian army" and discredits Ukraine, showing that it is possible to bypass the Ukrainian -law on the side of the enemy, - summarized in the CPD.

 The chief conductor of the national team of Ukraine in football Sergey Rebrov spoke zeurnalists after the match of the European Championships-2024 with the Monalt team(1:0).
Про це повідомляє офіційний сайт Ukrainian Football Association(Waf), reports Ukrinform.
- It is difficult to spend three games in 10 days. We knew that this meeting would be very weighted. As in the last match, they spent the second half more confidently. The main thing was to get three points and move on.
- everyone expected a more confident victory. This Ukraine has played worse, templag, did Malta deserve praise? 
- It is very difficult for us to play with such teams, because they have a very compact defense. I realized that it would be so that in the second half we will play better than the stubborn. They spent a lot of strength, pressed a lot, so there was a much better game in the second half of the meeting. I expected it. We always play hard against such saturated defense. Many moments were crucified in the second half. Yes, they had to score more. I know that in Ukraine everyone is waiting for 5-0, 6-0, but now all teams can defend themselves.
- Why did you decide not to include in the application for the Kochergin and Rusyn match? 
- because we have to have 23 players, someone has to stay out of application.
- Do you consider Matvienko's output in the starting liner? 
- I don't know what mistakes are. I look at how ready the players are home to, how they play for their clubs, I analyze. As you can see, Mykolenko is not a grave time. This is his first two matches after the injury. I planned to release it in the second half. I think he has increased the level of our game in the attack.
- Maybe it was worth trying sable on the position of the left defender instead of mattresses? 
- I love all the players, but I get away from statistics, I look who is better. We have competition at every position, so I choose who will play. This is normal.
- Of course, it is too early to demand something from the national team of Ukraine. How do you think why are so difficult to win over rivals like Malta? Read also: The national team of Ukraine beat Malta in selection for Euro-2024 - Do you plan to attend youth Euro-2023 matches? 
- Yes, I plan to come to Bucharest. Tomorrow, my assistants are Gomez and Gleb Platov. I will come for a second or third game. This is a very important tournament. I wish our team success so that we get to the Olympics. From the giving of the players, I talked to them, they want to play for the youth. No one said he wanted to relax on the eve of the euro. They have made the all. I am sure that these players will help our "youth".
- What should we expect from the September matches of the national team of Ukraine? 
- We now met with Germany, showed a decent game. The next gaming will be official, we need to prepare seriously for any duels. We have always set a goal before - getting out of the group.
- How do you appreciate the Tsygankov game, which have already been appointed team leader? How did you determine who would beat the second penalty? 
- Victor himself set himself as the leader of the team. No one appointed him. What he does in the last three matches is his merit. Before the game, we determined that Yarmolenko would beat the penalty. But after the unsuccessful performance of the former, I saw that he himself suggested that Tsygankov punch. I understood that Andrew was not psychologically ready for the second penalty. Therefore, I am grateful to Tsygankov for showing that he was ready for it.

“We had occasions when we paid money but did not receive(weapons - ed.)»,- quotes the newspaper of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr Gavrilov.
According to him, the government analyzed the procurement during the past, and excluded problematic contractors from further work. Two people who participated in the execution of armed contracts for Ukraine reported that the shortage was subsequently delivered and in other cases brokers returned.
The publication calls the "crazy" volumes of western supplies weapons In Ukraine, it notes that problems are inevitable.
In particular, some of the platforms that went to Ukraine were unsuitable, although the documents indicated that weapons were ready for combat insurance. Some samples only agreed to spare parts for other systems. The editions, now about 30% of the Armed Forces, are renovated, which is a high indicator for a country that leads active contradiction.
One examples of problematic deliveries are the transfer of 33 self -propelled Goubitsyitalian government.
In Italy, it was confirmed that these machines needed major repairs, which was supported by the US contractor Ultra Defense Corporation. However, when the first batch of restored cars received the when they were "unusable for combat missions", the newspaper quoted the official document of the Ministry of Defense.

It took almost a month to find sufficient tires for replacement, which "delayed the delivery of other equipment to Ukraine, it took considerable effort and time," the Pentagon's report said.
A similar situation happened with the howits of the M777, which should have been sent in Ukraine a few weeks after the start of a full -scale invasion. As it seemed, they "needed serious maintenance", and one was in such a bad condition that "killed someone" while using it.
In January, the Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom, Ben Volles announced the planned transmission of self-propelled howitzers AS-90, including those who were in "varying degrees of readiness". Twelve of them needed either recovery or use for spare parts, according to a statement by the British Defense Ministry.

 NATO Secretary -General Jens Stoltenberg has named three priorities for the guarantee of Western democracies for the following decades, among which the first one is to continue assistance to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
He stated this today during a speech to the German business at a conference on the occasion of the German Industry Day, Ukrinform reports.
“We are now experiencing a critical moment for our safety. In the future, the competition between the great world forces is growing. Our values and democracy are undergoing pressure, President Putin has returned the war to Europe again. After the Clothes War, we all hoped for peaceful relations with Russia. Gradually, the cards were dispelled as a result of an aggressive tendency in Presidential's behavior, ”said NATO leader.
He recalled that such a trend was manifested during the Russian invasion of a group, in the actions of the Russian army in Syrian Aleppo, in the Russian aggression of Broad and in the Donbass. A full-scale invasion of Ukraine has finally curtailed any illusions that could remain about the possibility of constructive work with Russia, the Secretary General emphasized.
Read also: freezing conflict in Ukraine will not bring peace - Stoltenberg “So now we are in the turning point of our history. What we do or do not do now will determine our safety for the next anniversary, ”Stoltenberg said.
He emphasized the three main purposes, which should concentrate the Western Democracies to respond to the challenges coming from the more dangerous world.
“The first. We must continue to support Ukraine. NATO has helped Ukraine since 2014 and provided unprecedented assistance during the past year. Germany has a significant contribution to this work, transferring Ukraine's air protection, combat tanks, artillery and ammunition. This assistance increases the ability of Ukraine to fight on the battlefield and return their territories, and they can return more. We must continue to give them everything to help them as a sovereign and independent state. This is our immediate task, ”the NATO Secretary General has announced.“Second, we must continue to strengthen our defense. After the Russian has exposed a full -scale invasion of Ukraine, it was much better understanding why it is necessary - not to provoke a conflict, anavpaki - to preserve peace. It costs money. Therefore, NATO leaders of the next month in Vilnius will determine 2 percent of GDP as a minimum level of defense costs, ”Stoltenberg said.
Read also: Cooleba - Stoltenberg U: It is important to make a free -to -NATO membership in NATO, eliminating VAT He congratulated Germany's intention to reach this defense budget at 2 percent of GDP as early as 2024 and put a separate emphasis on the need to strengthen the potential of the defense industry of the event.
“Our stocks(weapons and ammunition - ed.)Evaporated, so they must be filled, not only in Germany, but in many countries around NATO. Production is the key to continue assistance to Ukraine and to ensure our defense, ”said the Alliance head.
The third main direction of security, in his opinion, is the cesaosa -running of the excessive dependence of Western democracies on resources that come from totalitarian states.

 The chief conductor of the national team of Ukraine in football Sergey Rebrov spoke zeurnalists after the match of the European Championships-2024 with the Monalt team(1:0).
Про це повідомляє офіційний сайт Ukrainian Football Association(Waf), reports Ukrinform.
- It is difficult to spend three games in 10 days. We knew that this meeting would be very weighted. As in the last match, they spent the second half more confidently. The main thing was to get three points and move on.
- everyone expected a more confident victory. This Ukraine has played worse, templag, did Malta deserve praise? 
- It is very difficult for us to play with such teams, because they have a very compact defense. I realized that it would be so that in the second half we will play better than the stubborn. They spent a lot of strength, pressed a lot, so there was a much better game in the second half of the meeting. I expected it. We always play hard against such saturated defense. Many moments were crucified in the second half. Yes, they had to score more. I know that in Ukraine everyone is waiting for 5-0, 6-0, but now all teams can defend themselves.
- Why did you decide not to include in the application for the Kochergin and Rusyn match? 
- because we have to have 23 players, someone has to stay out of application.
- Do you consider Matvienko's output in the starting liner? 
- I don't know what mistakes are. I look at how ready the players are home to, how they play for their clubs, I analyze. As you can see, Mykolenko is not a grave time. This is his first two matches after the injury. I planned to release it in the second half. I think he has increased the level of our game in the attack.
- Maybe it was worth trying sable on the position of the left defender instead of mattresses? 
- I love all the players, but I get away from statistics, I look who is better. We have competition at every position, so I choose who will play. This is normal.
- Of course, it is too early to demand something from the national team of Ukraine. How do you think why are so difficult to win over rivals like Malta? Read also: The national team of Ukraine beat Malta in selection for Euro-2024 - Do you plan to attend youth Euro-2023 matches? 
- Yes, I plan to come to Bucharest. Tomorrow, my assistants are Gomez and Gleb Platov. I will come for a second or third game. This is a very important tournament. I wish our team success so that we get to the Olympics. From the giving of the players, I talked to them, they want to play for the youth. No one said he wanted to relax on the eve of the euro. They have made the all. I am sure that these players will help our "youth".
- What should we expect from the September matches of the national team of Ukraine? 
- We now met with Germany, showed a decent game. The next gaming will be official, we need to prepare seriously for any duels. We have always set a goal before - getting out of the group.
- How do you appreciate the Tsygankov game, which have already been appointed team leader? How did you determine who would beat the second penalty? 
- Victor himself set himself as the leader of the team. No one appointed him. What he does in the last three matches is his merit. Before the game, we determined that Yarmolenko would beat the penalty. But after the unsuccessful performance of the former, I saw that he himself suggested that Tsygankov punch. I understood that Andrew was not psychologically ready for the second penalty. Therefore, I am grateful to Tsygankov for showing that he was ready for it.

Native prisoners of war were interested in the process of confirming the stay of captivity not only with the help of ICRC representatives, but also the outfit requests of the Ukrainian side.
“We cannot do this, because it is, in simple words, to overestimate the price of such people. That is, the Russian side, having received a similar request, has understood the increased attention to one or another captive and requires special conditions for his liberation, ”the expert explained.
Relatives of prisoners and missing defenders were also interested in the issue of prisoners of prisoners from maintenance in Russia or temporary -corresponding territories. The headquarters representative reported that in the event that a terrorist condemns Ukrainian prisoners under a criminal article, such people are often moved between different colonies.

“Most Russian applications are focused on an internal audience. In particular, the statement on "5 destroyed complexes" Patriot ". For Ukraine and our partners, it is a clear lie because we are in a dense communication with the allies. But for the average enlightened it is irrelevant, it would say [the Russian dictator] "five" or "fifty", - said Andrei Yusov.
The representative of Ukraine's military intelligence noted that the "Ukrainian counter -offensive" is increasingly commented on person or a person similar to Putin or Shoigu.
“This means that even the internal audience no longer perceives as the truth of the last instance of endless horses, nightingales and scabbies. That is, some drug is already highly. The image of Putin, who personally "bursts" the proceedings in Ukraine is the most difficult drug for Russian propaganda. And what further will be a break and a void, ”Andrey Yusov said.
Also, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence hinted at which the chief of the MO Kirill Budanov is silent:
“[It is about the operations that are planned, implemented and will soon be put to life. Some of them are happening right now - literally at this time. The results of these operations - they will see, ”Andrei Yusov said, adding that Shkirilo Budanov is in a wonderful working mood and reacts to Russian traffic about him with a characteristic branded laughter.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in your conversation.
"Rate. Priority - advanced, specific issues of offensive. There were reporters and commanders directly from the directions of fighting. Also reporting Committee, Head of GUR.
Separately and in detail they considered the preparation and provision of new brigade Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time for combat actions.
In some directions, our warriors move forward, in some directions protect positions and oppose storms and increased attacks of the invaders. There will be lost positions. Only released. They have only losses. And in general-the resolution of pressure, our pressure, which allows you to pave the path of our flag. Syno-yellow colors will be throughout our south and throughout our east. Bommy is on their land, and it gives the greatest power.
I thank all our soldiers - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer of every general who is attracted to our active offensive and defensives now. I thank you for every liberated and for every protected position!
Today, in a conversation with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Rice Sunak, defense needs as a time, thanked for the defense support. For example, the British "Svedou" - long -range missiles - make a very useful and accurate business at the front. Like many other weapons. And this cooperation will be a significant continuation.
Of course, they discussed with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister, preparing a NATO Vilnius summit and a meaningful filling of this Alliance meeting.
Today, there is also a significant political decision of Britain on sanctions - to keep junctions against Russia, until the aggressor compensates for all the damage caused to our country, our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all persons associated with it are related to the system of domination built by the Kremlin territory . It will be fair, and I am grateful to the British who support us on the path of justice.Both the conference and financial cooperation and our movement in the EU have discussed Ursula Der Lyen with the presidential community. Already this week we are expecting an intermediate oral evaluation of our work on the recommendations of the European Commission. And discussed in detail, the 11th sanctional package against Russia for the war.
He also spoke with the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte Tapremier, Denmark, Matte Frederixen. As always, they paid attention to the forefront and our joint defense efforts, thanked for their support and readiness to develop our cooperation for the sake of safety, " - the message reads.
The President also informed about negotiations with the leaders and representatives of Africa, who were in Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that Svetuvarto is more active in working with the formula of peace. Because only this formula is sufficiently reacting to every aspect of Russian madness.
Also, Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post -war transformation of Ukraine. About those decisions about those steps, about the new doctrine of the new Ukraine, which wins Ukraine, - the quotes that we prepare and implement. All together. Just as we now expose this aggression.
“Thank you all who are in battle now, in combat posts, in combat positions!
Especially today I will note the assault unit of GRU "Artan" and its commissarayor Torkotyuk. Thank you!
And yet - our special operations. Victor, all the guys - thank you very much!
Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!" Said the President.
