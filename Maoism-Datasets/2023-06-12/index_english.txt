Canada imposes additional sanctions against 24 physical and 17 organizations in Ukraine within the framework of the Regulations on Special Economic Measures(Ukraine) . Price measures are a direct answer to Russia's attempts to destroy cultural objects, institutions and identity of Ukraine.
About it reports The Canadian Government site.
In addition to significant damage and complete destruction of a number of Ukrainian cultural objects, thousands of Ukrainian cultural artifacts were found missing or, as reported, stolen by Russian troops in temporary -occupied territories after a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine in 2022 year. In its efforts, the identity of Ukraine, Russia, is reported that illegally exported Ukraine and caused harm to cultural heritage objects.
“With today's announcement, Canada imposes sanctions against persons associated with Russian cultural objects by Russia to resist Kreml's attempts to“ Russify ”Ukrainian culture. There are Ukrainians who work in museums and other cultural centers in the list of persons who have been submitted to the sub -centers. It also includes the newly created structures of the occupied territories of Ukraine, such as the so -called ministries of education, as well as natural and legal persons related to private military companies that have arisen in Ukraine and fight on the side of Russia, ”the message goes.
In addition, since Russia is trying to force its culture and the education of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, these sanctions will lead to further expenditure on the so -called power in the regions of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian Russian military in order to protect Ukrainian culture and identity.
With these sanctions, Canada confirms its unwavering devotion to the support of the people against the aggressive war of Russia, continuing to increase the pressure on Russia, who cooperate with the Russian administration in Ukraine as they stop these unjustified attacks.

АлеРосія не може сховатися від фактів, від незалежних розслідувань і від іншихсудових інституцій, які відхилили її фейкові конспіративні теорії. Ці фактивикривають дійсну сутність російського “потьомкінського села”: воно єфальшивою реальністю, побудованою на безпідставній пропаганді”, - сказалавона.
Золотарьова також закликала суд звернути увагу на джерела та якість доказовоїбази Росії, коли він розглядатиме її пояснення щодо інших питань, наприклад,чому бомби впали на житлові райони, чи вибухнули на мирних мітингах.

 Despite the fact that Russian propagandists are constantly expressing on the air the desire to undermine the dam of Kiev hydroelectric power station, it is almost impossible to do so.
This was emphasized by the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk in Televahorfon "Edininovy" In an interview with journalist Andriy Tsaplienko.
It is possible to destroy the dam of the Kiev hydroelectric power station only by blasting the inside, as it was made by the Russians with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, or through the use of nuclear weapons.
Instead, it is impossible to cause critical damage to the Kiev hydroelectric power station with rocket strokes.
