<p>Canada imposes additional sanctions against 24 physical and 17 organizations in Ukraine within the framework of the Regulations on Special <em>Economic Measures(Ukraine)</em>. Price measures are a direct answer to Russia's attempts to destroy cultural objects, institutions and identity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2023/06/minister-joly-announces-additional-sanctions-to-protect-ukrainian-culture-from-destruction-by-russia.html">reports</a>The Canadian Government site.</p>
<p>In addition to significant damage and complete destruction of a number of Ukrainian cultural objects, thousands of Ukrainian cultural artifacts were found missing or, as reported, stolen by Russian troops in temporary -occupied territories after a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine in 2022 year. In its efforts, the identity of Ukraine, Russia, is reported that illegally exported Ukraine and caused harm to cultural heritage objects.</p>
<p>“With today's announcement, Canada imposes sanctions against persons associated with Russian cultural objects by Russia to resist Kreml's attempts to“ Russify ”Ukrainian culture. There are Ukrainians who work in museums and other cultural centers in the list of persons who have been submitted to the sub -centers. It also includes the newly created structures of the occupied territories of Ukraine, such as the so -called ministries of education, as well as natural and legal persons related to private military companies that have arisen in Ukraine and fight on the side of Russia, ”the message goes.</p>
<p>In addition, since Russia is trying to force its culture and the education of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, these sanctions will lead to further expenditure on the so -called power in the regions of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian Russian military in order to protect Ukrainian culture and identity.</p>
<p>With these sanctions, Canada confirms its unwavering devotion to the support of the people against the aggressive war of Russia, continuing to increase the pressure on Russia, who cooperate with the Russian administration in Ukraine as they stop these unjustified attacks.</p>

<p>Antoncorynevich said this Ambassador from special instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine in an exclusive comment to Ukrinform correspondent in Hague.</p>
<p>“Today is essentially climax. It is the last day of oral hearing, where Ukraine presents its position. I want to say that the Ukrainian delegation, the Ukrainian team, a team of lawyers, did everything possible to present everything in a way to take into account every detail, every circumstance, every legal manner and we will do so in all other cases. I think that including citizens who follow this case can see how the parties to the parties constructed and of course, we hope that the decision of the international judgment will be violated by these two conventions by the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, Zelenskaya wrote about it in <a href="https://t.me/FirstLadyOfUkraine/3384">telegram</a>.</p>
<p>“Children who save their loved ones. Children who help their talent than the most defenders. <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti">Children</a>, which does not seem after terrible wounds. This is all our hero children, and meeting with them today has been incredible inspiration for me. At the same time, she confirmed again: they would not have to become heroes, not in war. And for us, adults, this childhood courage is an incentive to fight even more fiercely - to return children to children, ”Zelenska said.</p>
<p><em>Video: <a href="https://t.me/FirstLadyOfUkraine/3384">Elena Zelenskaya, Telegrams</a></em></p>
<p>Among such heroes is 7 -year -old Alexander Pascal, who lost his feet after the Russians of Odessa. And as soon as she came to 15 days in the hospital - to recover, whether he can do his favorite business - gymnastics. Now Sasha is trained and participates in competitions - on a prosthesis. The plans - to represent Ukraine of Naswita arenas.</p>
<p>12-year-old Konstantin Orekhov and his sister were with his grandfather with his grandfather, when a tail of the Russian missile "Hurricane" was hit in the house of Veliky Dimerka.</p>

And 12-year-old Alexander Demyanenko removed his sister from his burning apartment.</p>
<p>Solomiya Reut from the Dnieper, although only 7 years old, raises money for the Armed Forces, playing the city's scene on the snot. And 14-year-old Arsen Azhubei from Bila Tserkva, despite his or her own diagnosis-autism, sells his paintings to help defenders.</p>

<p>“While adults are struggling with the attacker, our children are opposed to their way. Those who met today - thousands of children across the country are rescued, overcome, help ... They have fallen too much, but they show how to live a dignity. But they are not children of war - they are our children. And, I am sure, they will only take the war behind as an episode of their long and full life. The winners will live, ”Zelenska emphasized.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, earlier Zelenskaya informed that the closest changes of Artek-Bukovel <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3721010-tabir-artekbukovel-prijme-vihovanciv-ditbudinkiv-hersonsini-zelenska.html">will be formed from the pupils of children's homes of family type of Kherson region</a>which was affected by the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant.</p>

<li>Currently, the enemy continues to strike with managed airbags. Along with the cymoblab, the frontline territory of the unpopular-Kamikadze of different types is being used. In any way, the Russians are used by "Shahda" to prevent them from beating from small arms, including large-caliber machine guns. Our mobile fire groups are already set by collimator sights, thermal imaging equipment, optics and conducters to effectively destroy such goals, - said the Sylvnny News Air Force Command Yuri Ignat.</li>
</ul>
<p>He added that now the war is going into the automation stage. Complexes, Yakiris-T, Nasams, Patriot, have the opportunity to work in both manual and wavetous mode. Here, human intervention is minimal, and the automation itself has a short time deciding to destroy the goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have already successfully work such Western complexes as Gepard, which have proven themselves against both Shahmed rockets and winged missiles. This is anti -aircraft guns that shoot the ammunition and one hundred percentages, because they have a radar binding to it and have a radio. They can operate in the wave mode. The only thing - they have a small radius. We need them to place them in certain areas and protect the objects that are traveling to attack. At the same time, the French complex Croale is quite efficient in the destruction of both Shahaneda and rockets, - summed up Yuri Ignat.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the blast of the dams, they had one goal - to disrupt our offensive operation. Keeping in mind that they could not fully understand our ideas, in my opinion, the enemy wanted to ensure the safety of their left flank. Using the dam, they made a barrier border and thus did not allow our offensive from the day. This made the enemy the opportunity to remove a certain number of its parts, in order to intersect the Zaporozhye direction against our offensive group. They need to close this direction in buzzy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oleksandr Pavlyuk noted that the occupiers did everything to concentrate their most likely, in their opinion, the direction of the offensive of Ukrainian siloborov.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would not want to operate specific numbers or share the existing in the nosinformation, it is an offensive operation and she loves silence. After the Podrivkakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Russians were able to transfer certain units to Zaporizhzhya to counteract our group,-said Lieutenantolexander Pavlyuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, he noted that the Russians never valued people's lives. So no one was warned.</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest floodplain areas are temporarily occupied. Approximately 2/3. Russia went to a terrible crime. They did not even warn the people who were on the thitter, - summed up Alexander Pavlyuk.</li>

<p>The first patient with osteintegrating prostheses was the 57-year-old captain of the Armed Forces Igorkronov. A man from the Dnieper. He is a Afghan veteran. In 2022, to voluntarily go to Ukraine. The extremities lost in the fall as a result of blasting the machine on a mini.</p>
<p>Now - more than six months after the loss of the limbs - the Ukrainian warrior already goes without a wheel chair. Wash and brushes his teeth, standing on artificial foams, walking and even steering the car.</p>
<p>The unbreakable defender shared the first impressions of walking on osteointere -giving prosthesis: “I go more and more confident and it is very pleased. Next - socialization, work, assistance of the front. Because the war is not over. It is very upset that many people have already ended. And you need to play long and get a nursing!”.</p>
<p>Currently, Igor Krupnova's rehabilitation is ongoing and he is engaged in physical therapists daily.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this recent technique has its restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive running and jumping are not recommended because the risk of bone fracture is very high; * Activation should be avoided that can increase the risk of infection. For example, bathing in swimming pools, lakes, ponds; * In the case of improperly exposed prosthesis axis, pain and other complications may occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that in April this year Igor Krupnov <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/18/vijskovyj-stav-pershym-v-ukrayini-komu-implantuvaly-protez-v-kistku/">used</a>Implants.
