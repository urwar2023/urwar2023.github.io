Canada imposes additional sanctions against 24 physical and 17 organizations in Ukraine within the framework of the Regulations on Special _Economic Measures(Ukraine)_. Price measures are a direct answer to Russia's attempts to destroy cultural objects, institutions and identity of Ukraine.

About it [reports](https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2023/06/minister-joly-announces-additional-sanctions-to-protect-ukrainian-culture-from-destruction-by-russia.html)The Canadian Government site.

In addition to significant damage and complete destruction of a number of Ukrainian cultural objects, thousands of Ukrainian cultural artifacts were found missing or, as reported, stolen by Russian troops in temporary -occupied territories after a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine in 2022 year. In its efforts, the identity of Ukraine, Russia, is reported that illegally exported Ukraine and caused harm to cultural heritage objects.

“With today's announcement, Canada imposes sanctions against persons associated with Russian cultural objects by Russia to resist Kreml's attempts to“ Russify ”Ukrainian culture. There are Ukrainians who work in museums and other cultural centers in the list of persons who have been submitted to the sub -centers. It also includes the newly created structures of the occupied territories of Ukraine, such as the so -called ministries of education, as well as natural and legal persons related to private military companies that have arisen in Ukraine and fight on the side of Russia, ”the message goes.

In addition, since Russia is trying to force its culture and the education of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, these sanctions will lead to further expenditure on the so -called power in the regions of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian Russian military in order to protect Ukrainian culture and identity.

With these sanctions, Canada confirms its unwavering devotion to the support of the people against the aggressive war of Russia, continuing to increase the pressure on Russia, who cooperate with the Russian administration in Ukraine as they stop these unjustified attacks.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romanian-pm-ciuca-resigns-agreed-ruling-coalition-power-swap-2023-06-12/).

Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Chuka stated that he resigned within the framework of the governing coalition, which aimed to ensure stability but which brought to a delay in the allocation of EU funds to restore the economy.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3721179-rumunia-vidklikae-svogo-posla-z-kenii-cerez-jogo-rasistski-vislovluvanna.html)Many expect that Romania President Klaus Johannis will appoint a leader-Democratic Party of Marcel Colak next Prime Minister, and the parliamentary vote on his candidacy should take place later.

"Our goal is to make the new government oath to Thursday," - told journalists.

Chlaak said he sees that the current coalition would work even after the general election in 2024. Now three coalition parties are still being interfering with key positions in the new government.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3720179-rumunia-zobovazala-rosijske-posolstvo-skorotiti-stat-na-51-posadu.html)However, the new Cabinet of Ministers may encounter riots by the non -speech public sector because of the requirements for salary raising, as much with pressure in order to implement the already delayed economic reforms agreed with the European Commission, in exchange for the renewal for recovery.

At the same time, Romania should reduce the budget deficit to the level of 3%set by 2024, when presidential, general, local European elections will take place in the country.

This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleb in the essential telephony "Unified News", Ukrinform reports.

According to the Ukrinform correspondent in the Hague, Oksana Zolottariv, a representative of Ukraine -Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said during her speech at hearings in the UN International Court of Justice.

“The Russian facade of equality cannot hide a terrible reality: Russia has provoked a regime(Coffe)”, - she said.

“Росія, наприклад, хотіла б, щоб цей суд повірив, що російська військовабригада не відправляла “Бук” в Україну; що цей “Бук” не збивав MH17; і щобойовики “ДНР”, які збили рейс MH17, не зробили нічого протизаконного. АлеРосія не може сховатися від фактів, від незалежних розслідувань і від іншихсудових інституцій, які відхилили її фейкові конспіративні теорії. Ці фактивикривають дійсну сутність російського “потьомкінського села”: воно єфальшивою реальністю, побудованою на безпідставній пропаганді”, - сказалавона.

Золотарьова також закликала суд звернути увагу на джерела та якість доказовоїбази Росії, коли він розглядатиме її пояснення щодо інших питань, наприклад,чому бомби впали на житлові райони, чи вибухнули на мирних мітингах.

In any way, the Russians are used by "Shahda" to prevent them from beating from small arms, including large-caliber machine guns. Our mobile fire groups are already set by collimator sights, thermal imaging equipment, optics and conducters to effectively destroy such goals, - said the Sylvnny News Air Force Command Yuri Ignat.

He added that now the war is going into the automation stage. Complexes, Yakiris-T, Nasams, Patriot, have the opportunity to work in both manual and wavetous mode. Here, human intervention is minimal, and the automation itself has a short time deciding to destroy the goal.

- We have already successfully work such Western complexes as Gepard, which have proven themselves against both Shahmed rockets and winged missiles. This is anti -aircraft guns that shoot the ammunition and one hundred percentages, because they have a radar binding to it and have a radio. They can operate in the wave mode. The only thing - they have a small radius. We need them to place them in certain areas and protect the objects that are traveling to attack.

Instead, it is impossible to cause critical damage to the Kiev hydroelectric power station with rocket strokes.

The first patient who was performed in our country was a stable defender who lost both feet in the war.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/moz.ukr/posts/pfbid02wJgCUkF5Tf4A21L6xG9q9wnDgzfAJ3ZsHyY8YP8n7Q7VZK8RtrSD7gvCbZUgiwDAl)Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

Osteointegration is the latest technique for our country: during surgery, prosthesis is implanted directly into the bone. And after healing and recovery, the artificial foot is precipitate.

The first patient with osteintegrating prostheses was the 57-year-old captain of the Armed Forces Igorkronov. A man from the Dnieper. He is a Afghan veteran. In 2022, to voluntarily go to Ukraine. The extremities lost in the fall as a result of blasting the machine on a mini.

Now - more than six months after the loss of the limbs - the Ukrainian warrior already goes without a wheel chair. Wash and brushes his teeth, standing on artificial foams, walking and even steering the car.

The unbreakable defender shared the first impressions of walking on osteointere -giving prosthesis: “I go more and more confident and it is very pleased. Next - socialization, work, assistance of the front. Because the war is not over. It is very upset that many people have already ended. And you need to play long and get a nursing!”.

Currently, Igor Krupnova's rehabilitation is ongoing and he is engaged in physical therapists daily.

It should be noted that this recent technique has its restrictions:

* Excessive running and jumping are not recommended because the risk of bone fracture is very high; * Activation should be avoided that can increase the risk of infection. For example, bathing in swimming pools, lakes, ponds; * In the case of improperly exposed prosthesis axis, pain and other complications may occur.

Recall that in April this year Igor Krupnov [used](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/18/vijskovyj-stav-pershym-v-ukrayini-komu-implantuvaly-protez-v-kistku/)Implants.
