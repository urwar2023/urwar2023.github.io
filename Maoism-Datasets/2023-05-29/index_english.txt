 Every one -on -attack returns us and the whole world to the obvious conclusion: Russia wants to drain to the end by evil, that is, to its defeat, because there is no other end in evil, except for defeat.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in his address to Ukrainians at the end of the 460th day of the war, Ukrinform reports.
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today it was a very long day, and this day began very early for many of our people.
Several Russian terrorist attacks per day. Shakhaned, winged missiles, ballistic. Managed Airlines. To thank our air defense - all defenders of the sky - today managed to save at least a hundred lives. Just a day. Most Shahaneda and rockets are shot down.
But every such terrorist attack returns us and the whole world to the obvious exclusion: Russia wants to go to the end by evil, that is, to its defeat, because there is no except and cannot be a different end other than defeat.
The world must see that terror loses.
When "Petriots" in the hands of Ukrainians provide one hundred percent of any Russian missiles, terror loses.
When the world increases pressure on Russia, including sanctioned, when the isolation of terrorist grows when its former partners are ashamed of any proximity with Moscow, terror loses.
And, of course, there is no greater humiliation for the terrorist state than the successes of our military.
Actually, we have our pressure, our pressure, with our "petriots" we have and will be able to respond to Russia to all manifestations of its evil.
And we will destroy this evil.
No one else in the world uses weapons against evil more efficiently than Ukrainians.
Today spent the meeting. The reports are very specific.
Supply of new air defense systems and missiles to them, corresponding to the agreements.
The effectiveness of our air defense and what can make the sky protect stronger.
The hit, which, unfortunately, is.
Our defenders are able to learn and do their best to make terrorists much more difficult.
Reported on the rate, as always, the head and commander of the operatives.
Not only to provide ammunition, not only preparation of new brigades, not our tactics.
But the terms. This is what is as important as possible. Terms of how we will move. We will. The decisions are made.
I thank every soldier and sergeant, officer and general, every brigade who prepared.
He also held a very meaningful meeting with our internationalists today.And I am grateful to all our partners who understand that respect for every human life, human freedom and international law are such values that are impossible for any compromise.
I want to thank Denmark today - the whole people, the whole Danish political class. Parliament, government and personally Ms. Prime Minister Fredericksen for the decision to increase the financing of the Danish Fund for Supporting Our Directorate worth over $ 3 billion.
Now the total amount of defense aid from Denmark will reach more than $ 4 billion700 million. Very important.
Such solutions make the defeat of Russian terror faster. Thank you for it!
He spoke with Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Saint today. He thanked him with the support of international rules, which is why the nation is united by the UN Charter and compulsory for all conventions.
He has invited Cambodia to join in common with different countries of the world to settle our peace formula.
This is a common global task - not to let Russia make terror something familiar to the world when someone else becomes ill.
And just before recording this appeal, he spent two more conversations.
He spoke with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. He informed about the strikers. He thanked for his readiness and continue to help us protect people.
The Netherlands - among the leaders in helping to protect against terror, for the involvement of terrorists.
We discussed our defense interaction - our new aviation coalition, coalition of modern fighters we create. And let's create!Of course, we discussed the and reinforcement of our air defense.
He spoke with Turkish President Erdogan. Greeted him on the victory of the skills.
I am convinced that our further cooperation - Ukraine and Turkey - at all levels can give even more benefits to our people and international stability.
The safety of our region and all of Europe, the world food security, the protection of the fundamental rules of international law is what we have done, do and will be done together.
Thank you all in the world who helps!Glory to all our soldiers!
Once again I thank the air forces and all our defenders and defenders of the sky.
Glory to Ukraine!

 The Russian War against Ukraine has been an additional testimony to the importance of combining modern technologies with "traditional" weapons on the battlefield, so the experience that shines every day in cruel battles with the invaders is very valuable for the development of NATO's own systems of restraint and defense.
This was told by NATO Secretary-General for new challenges of Devis van Wil, answering Ukrinform questions during the presentation of high-level dialogue from Nato-Ukraine innovation.
The dialogue was launched last week at the Brussels Headquarters of the Alliance of Viceremer-Minister in Innovation, Development of Education, Science of Tatekhnology of Ukraine Mikhail Fedorov.
“We stand next to you, and we do not expect any specific return from each element of assistance we provide to Ukraine. But the benefit for NATO This is obvious. Because you are infecting a new and very fast experience, using the latest technologies, what works and not. Your armed forces acquire truly unique knowledge of how this technique works, how to use it better to manage those gems. Because at the end, not only technologies, as such, but their practical application, are important, ”the Alliance spokesman said.

Of course, it also opens new opportunities for certain souzing countries that provide their services for Ukraine, and instead receive an important "insight", what they should improve, to keep the benefits, "David Vbel added.
He noted that the Kremlin's aggression against Georgia in 2008 and against Ukraine in 2014 became a "signal to awakening" for NATO. The Allies began to consistently ascertain their own capabilities of restraint and defense, as seeing existential threats near their own borders. It was then that a metadox was set up to 2% of GDP, for the first time on the Eastern flank, the Baltic States and in Poland, NATO combat units were located.“All of these measures, by definition, were tested when the invasion began in February last year(Russia in Ukraine - ed.). Нам дійсно було важкоуявити такого роду широкомасштабну війну в Європі. Але це відбулося. Вона незавершиться за кілька місяців, і, так, ми потребуємо всі ці матеріали, які минині бачимо на полі бою, з метою вистояти та оборонятися тривалий час... Надодаток, союзники постачають велику кількість (weapons)For Ukraine, it is that it will return its territories. All this really requires rethinking the path, which we organize all this, ”said the assistant to the Alliance.

 Russian against Ukraine has become an additional testimony to the importance of combining modern technologies with "traditional" weapons on the battlefield, so the experience that is drawn every day in brutal battles with the invaders is very valuable for the development of NATO restraint and defense systems.
This was told by NATO Secretary-General for new challenges of Devis van Wil, answering Ukrinform questions during the presentation of high-level dialogue from Nato-Ukraine innovation.
The dialogue was launched last week at the Brussels Headquarters of the Alliance of Viceremer-Minister in Innovation, Development of Education, Science of Tatekhnology of Ukraine Mikhail Fedorov.
“We stand next to you, and we do not expect any specific return from each element of assistance we provide to Ukraine. But the benefit for NATO This is obvious. Because you are infecting a new and very fast experience, using the latest technologies, what works and not. Your armed forces acquire truly unique knowledge of how this technique works, how to use it better to manage those gems. Because at the end, not only technologies, as such, but their practical application, are important, ”the Alliance spokesman said.

Of course, it also opens new opportunities for certain souzing countries that provide their services for Ukraine, and instead receive an important "insight", what they should improve, to keep the benefits, "David Vbel added.
He noted that the Kremlin's aggression against Georgia in 2008 and against Ukraine in 2014 became a "signal to awakening" for NATO. The Allies began to consistently ascertain their own capabilities of restraint and defense, as seeing existential threats near their own borders. It was then that a metadox was set up to 2% of GDP, for the first time on the Eastern flank, the Baltic States and in Poland, NATO combat units were located.“All of these measures, by definition, were tested when the invasion began in February last year(Russia in Ukraine - ed.). Нам дійсно було важкоуявити такого роду широкомасштабну війну в Європі. Але це відбулося. Вона незавершиться за кілька місяців, і, так, ми потребуємо всі ці матеріали, які минині бачимо на полі бою, з метою вистояти та оборонятися тривалий час... Надодаток, союзники постачають велику кількість (weapons)For Ukraine, it is that it will return its territories.

 Every one -on -attack returns us and the whole world to the obvious conclusion: Russia wants to drain to the end by evil, that is, to its defeat, because there is no other end in evil, except for defeat.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in his address to Ukrainians at the end of the 460th day of the war, Ukrinform reports.
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today it was a very long day, and this day began very early for many of our people.
Several Russian terrorist attacks per day. Shakhaned, winged missiles, ballistic. Managed Airlines. To thank our air defense - all defenders of the sky - today managed to save at least a hundred lives. Just a day. Most Shahaneda and rockets are shot down.
But every such terrorist attack returns us and the whole world to the obvious exclusion: Russia wants to go to the end by evil, that is, to its defeat, because there is no except and cannot be a different end other than defeat.
The world must see that terror loses.
When "Petriots" in the hands of Ukrainians provide one hundred percent of any Russian missiles, terror loses.
When the world increases pressure on Russia, including sanctioned, when the isolation of terrorist grows when its former partners are ashamed of any proximity with Moscow, terror loses.
And, of course, there is no greater humiliation for the terrorist state than the successes of our military.
Actually, we have our pressure, our pressure, with our "petriots" we have and will be able to respond to Russia to all manifestations of its evil.
And we will destroy this evil.
No one else in the world uses weapons against evil more efficiently than Ukrainians.
Today spent the meeting. The reports are very specific.
Supply of new air defense systems and missiles to them, corresponding to the agreements.
The effectiveness of our air defense and what can make the sky protect stronger.
The hit, which, unfortunately, is.
Our defenders are able to learn and do their best to make terrorists much more difficult.
Reported on the rate, as always, the head and commander of the operatives.
Not only to provide ammunition, not only preparation of new brigades, not our tactics.
But the terms. This is what is as important as possible. Terms of how we will move. We will. The decisions are made.
I thank every soldier and sergeant, officer and general, every brigade who prepared.
He also held a very meaningful meeting with our internationalists today.And I am grateful to all our partners who understand that respect for every human life, human freedom and international law are such values that are impossible for any compromise.
I want to thank Denmark today - the whole people, the whole Danish political class. Parliament, government and personally Ms. Prime Minister Fredericksen for the decision to increase the financing of the Danish Fund for Supporting Our Directorate worth over $ 3 billion.
Now the total amount of defense aid from Denmark will reach more than $ 4 billion700 million. Very important.
Such solutions make the defeat of Russian terror faster. Thank you for it!
He spoke with Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Saint today. He thanked him with the support of international rules, which is why the nation is united by the UN Charter and compulsory for all conventions.
He has invited Cambodia to join in common with different countries of the world to settle our peace formula.
This is a common global task - not to let Russia make terror something familiar to the world when someone else becomes ill.
And just before recording this appeal, he spent two more conversations.
He spoke with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. He informed about the strikers. He thanked for his readiness and continue to help us protect people.
The Netherlands - among the leaders in helping to protect against terror, for the involvement of terrorists.
We discussed our defense interaction - our new aviation coalition, coalition of modern fighters we create. And let's create!Of course, we discussed the and reinforcement of our air defense.
He spoke with Turkish President Erdogan. Greeted him on the victory of the skills.
I am convinced that our further cooperation - Ukraine and Turkey - at all levels can give even more benefits to our people and international stability.
The safety of our region and all of Europe, the world food security, the protection of the fundamental rules of international law is what we have done, do and will be done together.
Thank you all in the world who helps!Glory to all our soldiers!
Once again I thank the air forces and all our defenders and defenders of the sky.
Glory to Ukraine!

One of them is charged with state treason and the other is the expansion of information on the location of the Armed Forces units committed in the conditions(Part 2 of Art. 111, Part 2 of Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).
Слідством встановлено, що жительку Краматорська завербував представникспецслужб рф. На виконання завдань свого куратора жінка коригувала вогоньокупантів. Вона регулярно через месенджер повідомляла співробітнику силспеціальних операцій головного управління генерального штабу зс рф інформаціющодо результатів та місць ракетних ударів, завданих ворогом по населенихпунктах Донеччини.
Вона також передавала дані про місця дислокації, рух, кількість особовогоскладу та техніки ЗСУ для подальшого їх артилерійського обстрілу.
Обвинувачена усвідомлювала, що ця інформація буде використана ворогом дляподальшого проведення розвідувально-підривної діяльності на шкоду інтересам тадержавній безпеці України. За це агресор, у разі захоплення регіону,гарантував їй керівну посаду в окупаційній адміністрації.
У цій діяльності обвинуваченій допомагала подруга, теж жителька Краматорська,яка в силу своєї професійної діяльності володіла інформацією про місцядислокації ЗСУ.
Обидві прихильниці «руського міра» наразі перебувають під вартою.
Досудове розслідування — СБУ.

 On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to honor the courage and self -sacrifice of all Americans who stood up and continue to protect freedom.
Your freedom resisted thanks to those who fought for her. Our freedom will stand for those who are fighting for it. Freedom is based on the courage of the best in their own kind and on the readiness of young men and women who serve their noroda in the army, become the best of their kind and make their courage for the future of their nation.
When we remember the warriors who sacrificed our lives in the name of freedom, we have a reason why we are alive, why we live the way we like, and why our free nations will be.
Our duty is to teach children that freedom cannot be seen as a given. Our duty is to teach them to be grateful. Our duty is to honor anyone who has given their lives, protecting the freedom, the noble and free flag of their country and the people. Our duty is to remember what price was paid for keeping the light of freedom, despite all the dark times that came.
We, Ukrainians, will always be grateful to the United States and every American for the extraordinary support, who helps us to reduce Russian tyranny to those who lost to freedom.
My special thanks to this day of memory to all Americans of different times - sons of ideas, parents and mothers, brothers and sisters who became warriors whose force was transformed into the power of freedom and who was destined to show the world that freedom would be bright on the hill.
May our victory, the victory of Ukrainian soldiers, will make it light!
God, bless America!
Glory to Ukraine!

_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today it was a very long day, and this day began very early for many of our people.
Several Russian terrorist attacks per day. Shakhaned, winged missiles, ballistic. Managed Airlines. Thank our air defense - all defenders of the sky - today managed to save at least a hundred lives. Just a day. Most Shahaneda and rockets are shot down.
But every such terrorist attack returns us and the whole world to the obvious exclusion: Russia wants to go to the end by evil, that is, to its defeat, because there is no except and cannot be a different end other than defeat.
The world must see that the terror of the proh e .
When "Petriots" in the hands of Ukrainians are provided by one hundred percent of any Russian missiles, the terror of the proh e .
When the world increases the pressure on Russia, including sanctioned, when the isolation of terrorist grows when any proximity with Moscow is ashamed of its former partners, the terror of the proh e .
And, of course, there is no greater humiliation for the terrorist state than the successes of our military.
Actually, we have our pressure, our pressure, with our "petriots" we have and will be able to respond to Russia to all manifestations of its evil.
And we will destroy this evil.
No one else in the world uses weapons against evil more efficiently than Ukrainians.
Today spent the meeting. The reports are very specific.
Supply of new air defense systems and missiles to them, corresponding to the agreements.
The effectiveness of our air defense and what can make the sky protect stronger.
The hit, which, unfortunately, is.
Our defenders are able to learn and do their best to make terrorists much more difficult.
Reported on the rate, as always, the head and commander of the operatives.
Not only to provide ammunition, not only preparation of new brigades, not our tactics.
But the terms. This is what is as important as possible. Terms of how we will move. We will. The decisions are made.
I thank every soldier and sergeant, officer and general, every brigade who prepared.
He also held a very meaningful meeting with our internationalists today.
We are preparing new steps with partners to strengthen our protection. And for the other active action. There will be no alternative to complete liberation of our land. There will be no alternative to the complete protection of our values.
And I am grateful to all our partners who understand that respect for every human life, human freedom and international law are such values that are impossible for any compromise.Now the total amount of defense aid from Denmark will reach more than $ 4 billion700 million. Very important.
Such solutions make the defeat of Russian terror faster. Thank you for it!
He spoke with Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Saint today. He thanked him with the support of international rules, which is why the nation is united by the UN Charter and compulsory for all conventions.
He has invited Cambodia to join in common with different countries of the world to settle our peace formula.
This is a common global task - not to let Russia make terror something familiar to the world when someone else becomes ill.
And just before recording this appeal, he spent two more conversations.
He spoke with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. He informed about the strikers. He thanked for his readiness and continue to help us protect people.
The Netherlands is among the leaders in helping to protect against terror, to hold terrorists responsible.
We discussed our defense interaction - our new aviation coalition, coalition of modern fighters we create. And let's create!Of course, we discussed the and reinforcement of our air defense.
He spoke with Turkish President Erdogan. Greeted him on the victory of the skills.
I am convinced that our further cooperation - Ukraine and Turkey - at all levels can give even more benefits to our people and international stability.
The safety of our region and all of Europe, the world food security, the protection of the fundamental rules of international law is what we have done, do and will be done together.
Thank you all in the world who helps!Glory to all our soldiers!
Once again I thank the air forces and all our defenders and defenders of the sky.
Glory to Ukraine!
