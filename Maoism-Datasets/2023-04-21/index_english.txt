"Це дуже складний процес, оскільки і фарватер замінований, і перешкоди стоять,і бойові дії в цьому регіоні тривають. І говорити серйозно про включення цихпортів до "зернової ініціативи" перш ніж ми витіснимо ворога з Кінбурнськоїкоси і зони ураження, думаю, досить складно", - зазначив посол України.
Боднар зауважив, що питання про розширення зернової угоди на порти Миколаєва іХерсона стоїть на порядку денному ще від початку "зернової ініціативи".

 The material in the capital is still not adapted for use by low -mobility groups of the population, and this problem must be solved.
Roman Tkachuk, Director of the KSCA Municipal Security Department, said the Posconference in Ukrinform.
“The use of protective structures is an important issue. Not all our defense structures are adapted so that small -scale groups can be used. Yes, on the map we did the designations of storage and protective structures that can be used by such people. But I believe that more attention should be paid to such storage groups when conducting inspections, ”Tkachuk said.
 Ivann Malchevskaya
According to the coordinator of the Public Monitoring Group Ivannamalchevskaya, volunteers within the national monitoring campaign to cover whether shelters have ramps and whether a person with disabilities will be able to do them. It turned out that only 8% of the proven objects had them, but Stanubu was not always satisfactory.
As the director of the KSCA Municipal Security Department emphasized, every permanent man and the guest of the capital is entitled to receive protection regardless of whether Devin is at the time of announcement of air anxiety. When the siren was heard, it is necessary to open Tastes the closest shelter. “If someone, the commandant of this shelter or resident of the house where it is located, you are not allowed there, it is an offense, a criminal case. It is necessary to contact 102 immediately and provide appropriate information. If closed storage, law enforcement agencies, police and SESS are not responsible for opening such storage facilities, but in our city there is a municipal emergency rescue service. I personally take responsibility and give the Kars team so that they will leave and open a particular storage that is closed during air anxiety. Therefore, the utility service will do. The appeal can be made to the service dispatcher 101, and it will immediately be transferred to our KARS. Together with law enforcement agencies, the service will open the door and provide access to repositories, ”Tkachuk said.
At the same time, he acknowledged that such appeals to the municipal emergency service(Cars)The Kyiv Rescue Service was not so much. All reports are resolved promptly.According to the head of the department of organization of civil protection measures of the SESU. Kyiv Oleg Stovolos, a statistical number of shelters can cover the residents of the capital, but there are areas where there are no protective structures within 500 meters. This should also be noted when forming a protective structure fund in the future. “I would like to emphasize that during martial law we only cover shelters. The principle of two walls is possible only when it is disappeared suddenly and the person has not time to leave the building. But for some reason, some "experts" say that the principle of two walls is safe, that it is possible to hide and you do not need to go anywhere. Do not listen to them, because it is wrong. The most safe place during shelling is the underground space of the city. The abyss, when our rescuers disassembled the rubble of residential buildings on the "arrivals" showed that those people did not help the principle of two walls at all, ”he proclaimed.
 Roman Tkachuk
Participants in the press conference urged citizens not to think that the war was greedy and the danger has passed. There are many cases where people do not respond with shed and continue to stay on the streets, but it is worth remembering that there is no "training anxiety". And the ballistic hostile They come to our territory very quickly, and there have already been cases where the explosions were initially heard, and after this, the alert system. “Personal protection depends primarily on the Vasus Person. We can help you, but you make the decision on the shelter or not. I cannot force you to use protective structures, but we can open them for you, ”Tkachuk stressed.
As reported, there are more than 4 thousand shelters of different types in the capital. Last year, 398 civil protection structures were added in the city. The main increase in the number was due to the order of the simplest.
This year, over 290 million UAH is provided for overhaul of the basements of residential buildings in all 10 areas for use for the simplest shelter. Separately 61 million UAH is provided for work in civil protection structures of 4 districts - Darnytsky, Desnyanskiy, Obolon, and Svyatoshinsky.

 Another Russian agent was exposed in Kyiv region.
About it reports SBU.
The attacker was a local active lawyer, who previously worked as a prosecutor's office and, as a result of the failure of the certification, was released in 2021.
It was found that he was later recruited by the Russian special service to carry out intelligence and subversive activities against Ukraine.
At the instruction of the enemy, he tried to obtain maps of minefields, created for Silaboron on the approaches to Kyiv and in the Chernihiv region, as well as in the prifronted areas of East of Ukraine.
In addition, he explored the possible combat positions of M142 Himars jet artillery systems and the locations of the warehouses with ammunition and fuel and lubricants of the Armed Forces.
The Russian agent was looking for informants who offered a high monetary "reward" for the transfer of secret information.
Intelligence was needed by the occupiers to carry out the air strike of the Ukrainian troops, as well as to create their own map of Ukrainian fortifications.
However, the SBU staff worked on ahead - in a timely manner of the exposed agent, documented criminal acts and detained during the transfer of HIMARS.
In the course of the investigation it was found that the person also set up a scheme -made departure abroad of Ukrainian citizens of conscript age.
He attracted several accomplices to the equipment, who offered his clients' attachments for escape outside Ukraine.
During the search, the traitor's lawyer found computer equipment, mobile phone and information carriers that confirm the facts of the blasting activity of the aggressor country.
On the basis of the evidence collected, the security service informed him of the suspicion of a state treason committed in martial law.
The issue of the election of a precautionary measure in custody is resolved. Investigation is ongoing to establish all circumstances and to prosecute the perpetrators.
