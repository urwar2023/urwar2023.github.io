<p>This was stated by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar at a briefing on the topic: "Grain Agreement": How does the mechanism work now? " In the Media Center Ukraine -Ukrinform.</p>
<p>The diplomat recalled that the conclusion of the grain agreement on July 22, 2022 was perhaps, first of all, the actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the displacement of Russian from the north of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>"Today, the way out of Nikolaev and Kherson is under the fire control ... That is, it is first and foremost security risks that need to be taken into account, how to talk about the possibility of expanding the grain initiative," - said.</p>

<p>"Це дуже складний процес, оскільки і фарватер замінований, і перешкоди стоять,і бойові дії в цьому регіоні тривають. І говорити серйозно про включення цихпортів до "зернової ініціативи" перш ніж ми витіснимо ворога з Кінбурнськоїкоси і зони ураження, думаю, досить складно", - зазначив посол України.</p>
<p>Боднар зауважив, що питання про розширення зернової угоди на порти Миколаєва іХерсона стоїть на порядку денному ще від початку "зернової ініціативи".</p>

<p>Roman Tkachuk, Director of the KSCA Municipal Security Department, said the Posconference in Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“The use of protective structures is an important issue. Not all our defense structures are adapted so that small -scale groups can be used. Yes, on the map we did the designations of storage and protective structures that can be used by such people. But I believe that more attention should be paid to such storage groups when conducting inspections, ”Tkachuk said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-21T15-46-05-03-00/1682079129-780.jpg" />Ivann Malchevskaya</p>
<p>According to the coordinator of the Public Monitoring Group Ivannamalchevskaya, volunteers within the national monitoring campaign to cover whether shelters have ramps and whether a person with disabilities will be able to do them. It turned out that only 8% of the proven objects had them, but Stanubu was not always satisfactory.</p>
<p>As the director of the KSCA Municipal Security Department emphasized, every permanent man and the guest of the capital is entitled to receive protection regardless of whether Devin is at the time of announcement of air anxiety. When the siren was heard, it is necessary to open <a href="https://kyivcity.gov.ua/news/karta_ukrittiv_kiyeva/"></a>Tastes the closest shelter. “If someone, the commandant of this shelter or resident of the house where it is located, you are not allowed there, it is an offense, a criminal case. It is necessary to contact 102 immediately and provide appropriate information. If closed storage, law enforcement agencies, police and SESS are not responsible for opening such storage facilities, but in our city there is a municipal emergency rescue service. I personally take responsibility and give the Kars team so that they will leave and open a particular storage that is closed during air anxiety. Therefore, the utility service will do. The appeal can be made to the service dispatcher 101, and it will immediately be transferred to our KARS. Together with law enforcement agencies, the service will open the door and provide access to repositories, ”Tkachuk said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he acknowledged that such appeals to the municipal emergency service(Cars)The Kyiv Rescue Service was not so much. All reports are resolved promptly.According to the head of the department of organization of civil protection measures of the SESU. Kyiv Oleg Stovolos, a statistical number of shelters can cover the residents of the capital, but there are areas where there are no protective structures within 500 meters. This should also be noted when forming a protective structure fund in the future. “I would like to emphasize that during martial law we only cover shelters. The principle of two walls is possible only when it is disappeared suddenly and the person has not time to leave the building. But for some reason, some "experts" say that the principle of two walls is safe, that it is possible to hide and you do not need to go anywhere. Do not listen to them, because it is wrong. The most safe place during shelling is the underground space of the city. The abyss, when our rescuers disassembled the rubble of residential buildings on the "arrivals" showed that those people did not help the principle of two walls at all, ”he proclaimed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-21T15-46-05-03-00/1682079992-183.jpg" />Roman Tkachuk</p>
<p>Participants in the press conference urged citizens not to think that the war was greedy and the danger has passed. There are many cases where people do not respond with shed and continue to stay on the streets, but it is worth remembering that there is no "training anxiety". And the ballistic hostile <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-raketa"></a>They come to our territory very quickly, and there have already been cases where the explosions were initially heard, and after this, the alert system. “Personal protection depends primarily on the Vasus Person. We can help you, but you make the decision on the shelter or not. I cannot force you to use protective structures, but we can open them for you, ”Tkachuk stressed.</p>
<p>As reported, there are more than 4 thousand shelters of different types in the capital. Last year, 398 civil protection structures were added in the city. The main increase in the number was due to the order of the simplest.</p>
<p>This year, over 290 million UAH is provided for overhaul of the basements of residential buildings in all 10 areas for use for the simplest shelter. Separately 61 million UAH is provided for work in civil protection structures of 4 districts - Darnytsky, Desnyanskiy, Obolon, and Svyatoshinsky.</p>

<p>“It will be a tragedy for Ukrainians if President Putin wins, but it is dangerous for NATO allies. This will demonstrate to all authoritarian leaders that when they use military force to get what they want, it will make the world more dangerous, and NATO allies are more vulnerable. So my message to NATO allies is that in our interests, Ukraine will guarantee that Ukraine will win Ukraine . And he will win as a sovereign nation, ”Stoltenberg said.</p>

The meeting is chaired by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Unified Committee of US Headquarters General Mark Millie and combines over 50 countries, including NATO allies and partner representatives.</p>
<p>Before the meeting of the contact group on defense of Ukraine at the Ramstein military base in Germany in Germany, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin made a military invasion of Ukraine, made strategic mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>President Putin made several big mistakes, strategic mistakes when he invited to Ukraine. The first was the total underestimation of the Ukrainian army. He thought that he would control Ukraine for weeks and capture Kiev in several days. He also very underestimated NATO allies and our partners, their continuity to support Ukraine, - said Stoltenberg.</li>
</ul>
<p>NATO Secretary-General recalled that more than a year from the beginning of the Russian large-scale interference in Ukraine, Putin "in no way controls the country, as planned." On the east of Ukraine, around Kharkiv, and in the south - around Kherson.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we help Ukraine liberate more of our lands, giving them more modern military systems. With regard to tanks, along with older systems, they supply more new machines, such as Leopard-2, Challengeriz in Great Britain, American Abrams. We also provide combat drifts, armored personnel carriers - many ammunition to them. All this is very powerful that will allow Ukrainians to win, - said the Secretary General of NATO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NATO Secretary General said that the day before Ramstein had visited Ukraine in Bucha and was struck by what he saw, and emphasized the importance of strengthening the military assistance to Ukraine, which continues to defend himself against cruel Russian aggression.</p>
<ul>
<li>I returned from Kiev last night and met with President Zelensky, his message was that he very much appreciates and welcomes the powerful support that NATO members and partners provide Ukraine, but also counts on the fact that we will be able to support Ukraine in the future, - - - said Jens Stoltenberg.</li>

<p>Colonel Yuri Ignat spokesman said this on a live broadcast of the only news.</p>
<ul>
<li>The enemy actively continues to use tactical aviation to abandon the frontier territories of Ukraine with managed aviation bombs. Our means of radar intelligence we see that they attack the cabins of slit directions, without going into the area of efficient operation of our air defense system.</li>
</ul>
<p>They use these bombs every time, so this threat will be dedicated. Russia will increase the modernization and refinement of these Soviet Soviet aircraft, which they have a large number of warehouses. They additionally equip them with GPS navigation and wings. That is why we are launching more air defense systems, such as Patriot, SAMP/T, and multi-purpose F-16 combat aircraft.</p>

<p>The attacker was a local active lawyer, who previously worked as a prosecutor's office and, as a result of the failure of the certification, was released in 2021.</p>
<p>It was found that he was later recruited by the Russian special service to carry out intelligence and subversive activities against Ukraine.</p>
<p>At the instruction of the enemy, he tried to obtain maps of minefields, created for Silaboron on the approaches to Kyiv and in the Chernihiv region, as well as in the prifronted areas of East of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition, he explored the possible combat positions of M142 Himars jet artillery systems and the locations of the warehouses with ammunition and fuel and lubricants of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Russian agent was looking for informants who offered a high monetary "reward" for the transfer of secret information.</p>
<p>Intelligence was needed by the occupiers to carry out the air strike of the Ukrainian troops, as well as to create their own map of Ukrainian fortifications.</p>
<p>However, the SBU staff worked on ahead - in a timely manner of the exposed agent, documented criminal acts and detained during the transfer of HIMARS.</p>
<p>In the course of the investigation it was found that the person also set up a scheme -made departure abroad of Ukrainian citizens of conscript age.</p>
<p>He attracted several accomplices to the equipment, who offered his clients' attachments for escape outside Ukraine.</p>
<p>During the search, the traitor's lawyer found computer equipment, mobile phone and information carriers that confirm the facts of the blasting activity of the aggressor country.</p>
<p>On the basis of the evidence collected, the security service informed him of the suspicion of a state treason committed in martial law.</p>
<p>The issue of the election of a precautionary measure in custody is resolved. Investigation is ongoing to establish all circumstances and to prosecute the perpetrators.</p>

<p>He noted that despite the fact that Russia increases the shelling of large and small cities and the Ukrainian military suffered losses, Russia itself continues to pay the high price for its choice to start an unprovoked war against Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike Ukrainian troops, who have a high motivation to fight the country, fight for their freedom, democracy and their way of life, the Russians lack the will and leadership, - said Mark Millie.</li>
</ul>
<p>He noted that the calling campaign announced by the Russian Federation was not effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Russia has resorted to strengthening the conscript legislation because they are pulling their citizens into the chaos of war, but as long as it was quite ineffective. The hasty decisions have led to serious casualties when thousands of people have burned their country, trying to avoid departure to war. In addition, Russia continues to fail and does not achieve its goals. They could not break neither the Ukrainian government nor NATO. In fact, they did just way - the people of Ukraine stands, it is even more motivated and bold. And Natniko was not a stronger alliance. And, which has been repeatedly said by Ipresident Biden, and US defense minister Lloyd Austin - the United States will be confirmed by devoted support for Ukraine as much as it will be needed, ”Mark Millie assured.</li>

Currently, the sky over Ukraine will help to close air defense.</p>
<p>-The decision to provide F-16 or any other aircraft of the fourth generation is consistent with political leaders. But from a military point of view - the task is to control the airspace. You can control the air space in different ways. And the most economical, most effective, and fastest way for Ukraine is now aircraft that they have been working for over a year, preventing the Russians from effectively using air space, - said Mark Millie.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-21T96-00-00-04-00/277400_mark-milley_gettyimages_new_960x380_0.jpg" />According to him, Ukrainian forces skillfully use air defense systems and this is "most critical" now.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Russians tried to make some flights to Ukraine, but mostly in the occupied Ukraine occupied by Russia. The Russians failed to intercept the airspace further over the Ukrainian territory. Why? Due to the efficient use of Ukrainian air defense, which is now most important that the front forces and fortifications be protected, - said Mark Millie.</li>
</ul>
<p>He noted that "the most important thing now" is to make sure that the air defense system "reliable, accurate, deep" and "multi -level". In particular, from near, medium additive.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the most important military task now. It was a topic of today: aircraft system, to make sure that Ukraine can protect its air border, that Ukraine can protect its airspace, - Millie said.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also added that the training and preparation of pilots takes a long time.</p>
<p>-From the point of view of the aircraft themselves, because the preparation of pilots, etc., it takes a long time, and the Russians have a considerable amount of military-air forces, and in this way to bring Ukrainian air forces to this level, it is necessary to make value from many countries. Therefore, we will see the results of tick decisions that will be adopted or not made in the future, but now an urgent need is a anti -air defense, - Markmilli summed up.</p>
