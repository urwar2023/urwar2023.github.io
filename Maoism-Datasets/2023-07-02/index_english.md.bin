![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-01T81-00-00-04-00/crime-putin.jpg)About what prospects for creating a special international tribunade by the leader of the criminal Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, the Armyinform [told](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/)Director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Research and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Law of Ukraine(Eg), Doctor of Laws, Professor, Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Honored Lawyer of Ukraine Alexei Kot.

The correspondent of the information agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was the hope that in respect of Putin, according to the results of joint work of the Armed Forces, international partners, politicians, lawyers, representatives of the public, the pity will still adhere to the main principle of criminal law - inevitability of punishment.

Another thing, how to provide it? To continue your [interview](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/)Oleksiy Alexei Kots knew that the script with the involvement of Putin and his associates by the courts of Russian naragia seems absolutely unrealistic or even fantastic. Our nationality will also not be able to investigate Putin's military crimes, which has judicial immunity.

- In this case, the UN International Court of Justice clearly determined that national courts have jurisdictions over higher officials of foreign states. The head of state, the head of the foreign country and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are the so -called three, which is endowed with the personal immunity of Ratio Personae, - said Alexei Kot.

In such circumstances, he advised to focus on other mechanisms attracting international criminals-in particular on international legal instruments, which, taking into account the prescriptions of international law, will have a criminal jurisdiction over the top officials of the aggressor country. It is an interior criminal court or an international special tribunal.

The International Criminal Court was created by signing the Roman statute to ensure that military criminals are prosecuted, but it does not allow investigation in an inhabita regime - that is, retrieved -a -criminal proceedings. Therefore, Putin as an accused must be in the courtroom.The reason for the creation of the tribunal could be the resolution of the General Assembly, however, in view of its charter, neither in the General Assembly, nor such powers in the Secretary General. Therefore, it can question the authority of such a tribunal.

-Speaking of a more or less real option, at least as I see it with my colleagues discussed it at various conferences-it should be a "criminal ramstin". In the end, there is a coalition of our disadvantages, so partners, so I think it would be quite reasonable to ask about the creation of a special International Criminal Court of AD HOC _(letters. For a specific case. - Ed.)_ To consider exclusively military crimes committed by the Russian criminal leadership in our country of anti -Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian cities and towns, Ukrainian nature, - says Alexei Kot. - The agreement on the creation of such a tribunal must be imposed on its powers, procedural aspects, the possibility of joining the signatures of other countries. We know that defeat is always an orphan, and there are always many parents. When we still get our dream trainery, there will be many countries in the hesitation, but later with the fair -to -face "pick up this deck" and join this tribunal. The possible way to join such an agreement should be provided in advance.

Finally, the director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Scientific and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Alexei Kot noted that modern world, as well as after the Second World War, requires the creation of new safe instruments: “We hope, finding effective mechanism of international punishment for Ukraine's crime in Ukraine The answer to the question about the creation of an international special tribunal, a new Nuremberg for Putin's click, which will confirm one of the following criminal law principles is the inevitability of punishment.

About it in an interview with a German edition [bild](https://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik/ukraine-aussenminister-kuleba-rechnet-mit-orban-ab-das-ist-alles-bla-bla-bla-84530292.bild.html), Welt Ipolitico said the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba, reports Ukrinform.

“The first mistake is that leaders see our NATO membership as a way of a new war. In fact, it's the way to peace. When we become a member of NATO, Russia will never dare to attack us, ”the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

He also cited another argument in favor of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance, which will help that the Ukrainian army will assist on its eastern flancing states, who will want to strengthen their defense against the Russian threat.

“We will take over part of this burden. There will be not German Brigades, but Ukrainian, ”the diplomat said.

He stressed that in Kiev they do not say that Ukraine becomes a member [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)immediately until the war is going on.

“But, of course, for Europe, after the war, it will be suicide not to accept Ukraine. The this is a way to close the door for Russian aggression against Europe with the Taiurotlantic region, ”said the Foreign Minister of Ukraine.

This decision, he stressed, opened Putin's opportunity to invade Georgia and continue destabilizing activities in the region, eventually illegally annexed Crimea. As if Ukraine was adopted in NATO until 2014, there would be no illegal annexation, there would a large -scale invasion, the minister is convinced.Kuleba named the main difficulties with which the Ukrainian army faces in a walk: replaced territories(Therefore, "our fighters have to crawl 200-300 meters a day to release the corridor for the advancing troops"); Russian defense lines fortified and steel; The dominance of Russia is in the world.

Like football, where everyone knows how to play, fit or drive differently. But for us it is a daily effort at the cost of human life. The most important thing is that we are achieving progress, ” - replied to the culibrics, the allegedly slow pace of the Ukrainian offensive. He acknowledged that the Russian army was "looking for ways to surprise" that they were able to impress the Ukrainian counter -offensive forces with massive use of percussion and aviation, but Cones means that the military leadership underestimates the enemy.

The conversation was conducted by the famous German journalist Paul Ronzheimer, who interviewed many leaders and made reports from the front line in Ukraine.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [BBC.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65955365)The aircraft found were sent to the Soviet Union in the United Kingdom of Germany in 1941.

They were part of a package of allied military support of the USSR, which was paid to the United States under the so -called landscape scheme.

Similar legislation is used today by the US Government for the Sending Military Assistance to Ukraine because it seeks to expel Russian troops of the reservoir.

Aviation experts say this for the first time in Ukraine found the remains of such a number of [aircraft](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-litak)Harrykane.

"This aircraft can be very rarely found in Ukraine," says Alex Stan, a former pilot of an airline that heads excavations. "This is very important for the history of our Iviation, because there were no aircraft provided by Landliz before," he added.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-02T15-20-00-03-00/1688299521-402.jpg)In total, from 1941 to 1944, about 3,000 Harrykane aircraft were sent to support military operations to the USSR. Most of them were or bundled in battle or later disassembled for spare parts.

These aircraft took away tools, radios, machine guns and any coal metal. Then they were dragged by tractors from the adjacent airfield, the spreading was thrown into a shallow ravine. It is believed that they were then covered with the earth with the benefit of bulldozers.

The remnants of the aircraft were recently discovered after a bomb had been found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked with a metal detector there were planes there.Now the National Aviation Museum of Ukraine conducts careful excavations of this place. The museum staff seek to identify as many aircraft as possible, that they could be re -assembled and displayed.

The head of the scientific part of the museum Valery Romanenko says that these planes played an important role in the history of Ukraine.

"Harrikein is a symbol of British help during the Second World War, Taksamo as we very much appreciate British help now," he said.

“We are preparing in Kiev on the basis of the club. We had a meeting, which we organized the Federation. I am very grateful to all coaches for support and assistance. It is difficult to prepare through the Russian invasion. When I came to Poland, I go to the corridor in the phone announce the beginning of air anxiety, then everyone else begins to see. It is necessary to explain that there is a threat of a Russian robot stroke in Ukraine now. For loved ones you start thinking immediately. We try to immediately sign up and return mentally to the competition, ”Zamyatin said.

This was reported in a comment [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101763)Mayor of Energodar Dmitroorlov, reports Ukrinform.

"Regarding the workers of the nuclear power station, there is information that the part of the co -laboratory assets who have concluded contracts with Rosatom and occupied the leading positions of the UFEi Company from" Rosatom ", left the city ... also part of Rosatoma staff, imported from Russian atomic stations - few of them, up to 100fham - left the city at the end of the previous week, "Orlov said.

According to him, the explosives were brought to the invaders almost a year ago: the perimeter of the station, the entire coast of the Kakhovka reservoir was founded.

"And since the beginning of this year, the Russians began to be chaotic, perhaps preparing for the counter -offensive of the Armed Forces, the territory around the perimeter of the city, pole -by -law. And what they did with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, had a significant impact on the mood of those specialists who still remain in City energy. They understand that the enemy will be capable of any step, and the disposal of trucks with explosives indicates that the occupiers are preparing to produce any scenarios. In fact, the Russians use the nuclear station as an international influence for blackmail not only Ukraine but the world but the world ", -the mayor.

At the same time, according to him, Energodar does not provide shelter in the case of an explosion of the ZPP.

In any cases of nuclear and radiation in the station, which are foresected in the regulations and instructions, the city of Energodar is categorical. The weather conditions that will be at that time. The shelter is only the stroke premises at the nuclear, heat station, factories, slammed, ”Orlov stated.The mayor of Energodar said that in December last year, any evacuation of residents of the city through Vasylivka was occupied. For some time, they were able to evacuate through the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, but the NPP workers were not missed - the Russians had their lists.

"As far as the humanitarian component is concerned, the occupiers have blocked any opportunity from September(Shipment)humanitarian cargoes, including medicines, such as Insllulin, which is important for the lives of some categories of citizens, " - said the official.

Since Energodar is located on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir, Ukrainian mobile operators are able to "break through" to the upper floors of high -rise buildings. "In this way, residents are able to receive objective information by connecting pre-ternet sources, Ukrainian telegrams," Orlov said.

However, according to him, the invaders block Ukrainian TV channels and radio, and have taken control of all online resources. Therefore, propaganda has been working there for more than a year and for residents who do not have access to objective channels of information, it is not very difficult to fall under the influence of propaganda information resources. "

Orlov also noted that the Russian military now "not very active" moves in [Energodar](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-energodar). At the same time, increasing searches may indicate the preparation of the invaders of the good "goodwill gesture".

As reported by Ukrinform, on March 4, 2022, the Russians occupied the ZPP.

On June 22, 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared plans for a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Alexei Danilov stated that Ukraine is preparing for any scenarios for developments around Zaporizhzhya AAP.

Russia has completely stopped the registration of the new fleet from June 26, which testifies to the pro -the same to disrupt food supply to the world markets.

About it [reports](https://m.facebook.com/Ministry.for.restoration?eav=AfYQSzuFdOBCeayfHSu7eUbQLG_UzqeHJArpE2MYW65UCEXvCAlar2VZRerx2UP3YTw&paipv=0)Ministry of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.

29 ships that have to export 1.4 million tons of food mainly for the 5 countries of Asia and Africa, including China, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, blocked by Russia in Turkey's territorial waters.

In June, only 2 million tons were exported from Ukrainian ports. Another 1 million tons of food will either load or have already been partially loaded on 13 ships - the last registered in the initiative. If you do not restore the registration, the grain agreement will be completely stopped.

In 11 months, 45 countries received 32.5 million tons of food. An additional 25 million tons of tonnes did not receive the world due to sabotage. But even with these indicators, according to the UN, it was possible to reduce the world prices for food by 22%. This is a direct evidence that the grain agreement is needed by the world.

We support a statement of the Joint Coordination Center that all parties should be adequately accessed by vessels for food export, because it is a food danger to the entire world market. Only joint guns is able to stop Russia's food.

We urge partners under the agreement and all countries of the civilized world to defend the right to food. Ukraine, for its part, will also defend the right of a prominent trade navigation, which is recorded in international conventions.

Knowledge and practices of the Croatian side are extremely relevant to us because of historical circumstances and, unfortunately, the specifics of the crimes that have been committed. We are trying to the ACA group for making this study trip possible.

Croatia has considerable experience in the field of investigation and judicial prosecution. Therefore, this training is, first and foremost, a practical workshop. The focus is practical issues: collecting and preserving evidence, specializing units, investigating the crimes of sexual violence related to conflict, prosecuting command, examination, electronic documentation, as well as the experience Andriy Kostin.

Participants - 30 representatives of Ukrainian criminal justice institutions: investigators of the SBU and National Police and prosecutors specializing in military races; Prosecutors of the juvenile direction, the ecological prosecutor's office, the coordination center of support of victims and witnesses.

- Of course, if you compare the potential at the beginning of large -scale aggression of the International and the Russian Fleet, it was in favor of the Russians. But we also did not stand a place and built our fleet, constantly moving forward. In particular, the implementation of missile programs, which was approved by the Balanced Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, is a striking example. Thanks to their implementation, the Ukrainian Neptune Missile Complex was created. Among the people who implemented rocket programs were my former robotic subordinates, who were still using winged missiles in Crimea. And it is thanks to them, to these people, today the opponent does not approach the coast of Odessa less than 100 sea miles, and between us and the enemy now there is a "gray zone", which covers 25 thousand square kilometers, - said Viceadmiral Alexei Shepap.

The commander of the Navy also noted that due to the receipt of new rocket weapons and other assistance from our Western partners, our defense potential has grown.

- You know that nowadays, the Navy is an anti -ship complex "Harpun", which has already proven itself very well during the fighting to protect our state. This complex, in particular, drowning the Russian security vessel, which is Malons of the SCR "Thor" and went to the island of Snake to provide a Russian garrison and deliver a fresh batch of invaders to reinforcement, ”Alexei Zhpapa said.

- These are the ships of the Corvette class, mine ships, which, incidentally, are now needed. This also applies to platforms for landing forces. And from this reason the decision of the Supreme Commander to create the Corpsumor infantry was made, - said the Navy commander. - its creation provides an increase in the number of relevant crews, as well as the creation of a management body of the security units that will be involved in the coastal direction.

He emphasized that the main task of the Marines is to capture the landscapes in the territory held by the enemy, as well as in the protection and defense of the Navy and other important objects.

- But during the landing of the Marines landing requires the help of land troops. The creation of the corps will allow marine infantrymen to become self -sufficient tanadali without the support of the Land Forces to resolve the questions about the first, second and third stage of the marine landing. Therefore, the building should become a very powerful fist, which will carry out the landing of the landing, and raid actions, the deployment into the depths of our territory, - said Viceadmiral Alexei Shepap. “The number of brigades is increasing because, in addition to the Black Sea, we also have the Jazov Sea and many rivers, where there should be mobile forces that can supply water obstacles. Therefore, such a powerful organism is created, the yakorpus of the Marines, which should begin the full functioning of the already current year.

About the middle of last year, there is a trend of growth of attack attacks on the supply chain(supply chain attacks). Йдеться,зокрема, про ІТ-компанії, що розробляють рішення для критичної інфраструктури.

Про це[повідомляє](https://www.facebook.com/dsszzi?__cft__\[0\]=AZXDhhjIwr8N1E7-4NnHxMah7Nxn9ATbzloUn0GkA5I19Y1SbykYR3DCV8NuhNQ9PiQXG--rUsZ66DU3vXEZoxLuBqZUvXSrvNtHXcwrnv8iZhZ14TbMl424F7CTUWJopJH8YlNCr7rSM3drv5-ldSZT&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R)State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine.

For IT companies and specialized software developers, such attacks are the first reputational threat and risks of losing customers in the future, while for critical infrastructure, the effects of such attacks can be more serious.

Often, specialized software developers and technological companies mistakenly consider it sufficiently protected and capable of resisting threats on their own - it is impossible in the modern world every time, after we see the breakdowns of such companies as Uber, Fireeye and others. Such underestimation of risks can lead to the pre -compromination of the entire supply chain and unprecedented impact on all clients.

Cyber resistance of critical infrastructure depends on whether the objects of critical infrastructure detect and lock trycomprotation and whether the code and infrastructure audit are performed. Unfortunately, many do not realize this. Therefore, it is important that the relevant requirements for cyber defense companies-suppliers of critical infrastructure are enshrined in the name.

Recently, the collection "Examples of providing free legal aid to the defenders and defenders of Ukraine and their families", which is developed by the BDA.

The publication, in particular, states that since February 24, 2022, nearly 12,000 defenders and defenders of Ukraine have been declared to the BPD system. In every three -law, clients needed secondary legal aid, including the request of pre -trial.

**

**

The serviceman who was in captivity, the BPD system helped to get theoffic status and monetary compensation. Not all legal issues need to be addressed. Often there is enough consultation and assistance in assembly. This was the case in the case of a serviceman Yuri, who addressed the Dazaporzha Legal Aid Bureau._

By protecting the country, the guy was captured. After the release of the police, Yuri passed all the necessary measures and returned to the military service. This was necessary, it was necessary to resolve the issue of registration of the official status of the unusable in order to obtain the compensation provided for by law. The lawyers of the Bureau Anna Romanok were entrusted to help the case. The specialist helped the boy to pick up all the necessary documents and submit the relevant application to the Ministry of Inquiries of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine._

_Yuri received a response to his appeal. The Interagency Commission decided to find it a person who was deprived of freedom as a result of the armed aggression of the RFPRO of Ukraine. Now, in addition to official status, the guy will receive a cash aid in the amount of up to 100,000 hryvnias.

_Tha, the BPD system helped the soldier who was held captive to recognize him as a person who was deprived of freedom as a result of armed aggression of the Russian Federation._

**

**Among the most common appeals from military questions about:

* state aid, payments and compensation; * appeal of decisions, actions and omissions of state authorities and local self -government bodies; * military service, including military accounting, mobilization, booking, etc.

In addition, the collection presents examples of legal assistance to members of the dead heroes. In particular, they have to contact lawyers to establish facts of death during military duty, to prove the duty of the dead defender, to make payments. Our lawyers make it predictable to help solve these legal problems. During the period, the gross -scale invasion of the BPD system registered more than two thousand arguments from the families of fallen defenders and defenders.

“The help of war veterans has always been for the BPD system in priority, but it is of particular importance. In this collection, we present only some of many cases that have completed positively in favor of our clients, ”the director of the Coordination Center for Legal Aid Alexandraranov.

The assembly is available at ** bit.ly/3npopjh **.

The authors of the collection note that if for various reasons, a serviceman may not be able to contact the Legal Aid Bureau, he can use other BPD services: BP:

In their account, the destruction of several patrol boats of the Raptor type and even a helicopter, which was shot down by our aircraft during his landing on the island of Snake, when he tried to send a place for a place, - said Alexei Heaven Zhpapa.

He also noted a helicopter squadron intended for the support of the Maritime infantry.

- In addition, today we have some replenishment. For example, we got the found partners of the Sea King helicopter. And our pilots quickly mastered this technique.

- As a commander, of course, I expect a lot and would like to have more modern -day bonds that can fight. Of course, the construction of new ships is dedicated to a long process. At the same time, there are plans for some ships that have capacity and potential and are able to serve in the Navy for another 10-15 years at a high technical level, which will not allow the enemy to even look towards the sea, realizing that he has no prospects. Moreover, the economy of Ukraine is very dependent on the sea, - said Alexeynetpapa. - That is why we are obliged to become a maritime state, not the state of the Biscuit. And for this you need to have both powerful ships and powerful marine infantry. All of us should develop.

Viceadmiral emphasized that he expects to help from our partners with ship platforms, the construction of the Marine Corps, and, in particular, for staffing.

- We need both planes and shock helicopters to support the actions of marine inhabitants. That is, the fleet is diverse and should develop in all directions, - summed up Alexei Zhpapa.

- The Navy of Ukraine already contains two mine ships - Chernihiv and Cherkasy, which are now temporarily in the United Kingdom. It is carried out, with a very high level, the preparation of crews ... We can say that our crews are fortunate - they are undergoing preparation for the NATO program, during which all the juices are squeezed out of them. It is very difficult to get such powerful training and then check the crew. But this is done so that then the fight is easier, - said Alexei Zhpapa.

He added that these ships were partially upgraded and will serve for many years in the Ukrainian Navy. They will be the first to participate in the Black Sea and release the Black Sea for the protection of civilian navigation.

- I note that in connection with the blasting of the dam on the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, the number of mines of the educational sea has now increased many times over. Because Russia, fearing our contrast across the Dnieper River, created a whole system of mine barriers, establishing on the river anti -deposit, anchor, river mines, which, of course, the flows were washed away and found themselves in the Black Sea. Therefore, the number of mines that were invented for this tragic event, with what we have today, is very difficult to compare,-said the commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksiy Zhpapa. - I think that we should always be alert to further, to ensure the safety of civilian navigation as soon as possible.

- First of all, these are the actions of Marines. Never forget how in the first days, one of the Marines blew himself together with the bridge on the Crimean. It also struck the way one of the boys knocked down three -controvers in one day. The deed of the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Igor Bedzai, who himself sat down at the helicopter hello, will remain in the memory of the hero, although he could entrust this to the deed pilots. I can not but mention our heroic rockets who write a new history of naval battles with their works. After all, it is not every day to go to the Donovo Rocket cruiser. Thank you also to divers who work in the high conditions and at night, destroying mines. And in general, you can tell for hours the proteaism of my subordinates. And it is really difficult to separate someone. Every navy has something to be proud of, because our people are indeed invincible!- Alexei Zhpapa said in [interview](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/02/my-povynni-maty-takyj-flot-yakyj-bilshe-ne-dast-zagarbnyku-navit-planuvaty-napad-na-ukrayinu-oleksij-neyizhpapa/?utm_source=mainnews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=traficsource)for ia.
