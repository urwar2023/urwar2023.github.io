 About what prospects for creating a special international tribunade by the leader of the criminal Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, the Armyinform told Director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Research and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Law of Ukraine(Eg), Doctor of Laws, Professor, Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Honored Lawyer of Ukraine Alexei Kot.
The correspondent of the information agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was the hope that in respect of Putin, according to the results of joint work of the Armed Forces, international partners, politicians, lawyers, representatives of the public, the pity will still adhere to the main principle of criminal law - inevitability of punishment.

Another thing, how to provide it? To continue your interview Oleksiy Alexei Kots knew that the script with the involvement of Putin and his associates by the courts of Russian naragia seems absolutely unrealistic or even fantastic. Our nationality will also not be able to investigate Putin's military crimes, which has judicial immunity.
In such circumstances, he advised to focus on other mechanisms attracting international criminals-in particular on international legal instruments, which, taking into account the prescriptions of international law, will have a criminal jurisdiction over the top officials of the aggressor country. It is an interior criminal court or an international special tribunal.
The International Criminal Court was created by signing the Roman statute to ensure that military criminals are prosecuted, but it does not allow investigation in an inhabita regime - that is, retrieved -a -criminal proceedings. Therefore, Putin as an accused must be in the courtroom.The reason for the creation of the tribunal could be the resolution of the General Assembly, however, in view of its charter, neither in the General Assembly, nor such powers in the Secretary General. Therefore, it can question the authority of such a tribunal.
-Speaking of a more or less real option, at least as I see it with my colleagues discussed it at various conferences-it should be a "criminal ramstin". In the end, there is a coalition of our disadvantages, so partners, so I think it would be quite reasonable to ask about the creation of a special International Criminal Court of AD HOC (letters. For a specific case. - Ed.) To consider exclusively military crimes committed by the Russian criminal leadership in our country of anti -Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian cities and towns, Ukrainian nature, - says Alexei Kot. - The agreement on the creation of such a tribunal must be imposed on its powers, procedural aspects, the possibility of joining the signatures of other countries. We know that defeat is always an orphan, and there are always many parents. When we still get our dream trainery, there will be many countries in the hesitation, but later with the fair -to -face "pick up this deck" and join this tribunal. The possible way to join such an agreement should be provided in advance.
Finally, the director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Scientific and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Alexei Kot noted that modern world, as well as after the Second World War, requires the creation of new safe instruments: “We hope, finding effective mechanism of international punishment for Ukraine's crime in Ukraine The answer to the question about the creation of an international special tribunal, a new Nuremberg for Putin's click, which will confirm one of the following criminal law principles is the inevitability of punishment.

“The first mistake is that leaders see our NATO membership as a way of a new war. In fact, it's the way to peace. When we become a member of NATO, Russia will never dare to attack us, ”the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.
He also cited another argument in favor of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance, which will help that the Ukrainian army will assist on its eastern flancing states, who will want to strengthen their defense against the Russian threat.
“We will take over part of this burden. There will be not German Brigades, but Ukrainian, ”the diplomat said.

 A number of workers of Rosatomi, brought to the Zaporizhzhya NPP from Russia, went Zenergodar, as well as part of the collaborators - employees of the ZPP, who have concluded contracts of the Russians.
This was reported in a comment Ukrainian radio Mayor of Energodar Dmitroorlov, reports Ukrinform.
"Regarding the workers of the nuclear power station, there is information that the part of the co -laboratory assets who have concluded contracts with Rosatom and occupied the leading positions of the UFEi Company from" Rosatom ", left the city ... also part of Rosatoma staff, imported from Russian atomic stations - few of them, up to 100fham - left the city at the end of the previous week, "Orlov said.
According to him, the explosives were brought to the invaders almost a year ago: the perimeter of the station, the entire coast of the Kakhovka reservoir was founded.
"And since the beginning of this year, the Russians began to be chaotic, perhaps preparing for the counter -offensive of the Armed Forces, the territory around the perimeter of the city, pole -by -law. And what they did with the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, had a significant impact on the mood of those specialists who still remain in City energy. They understand that the enemy will be capable of any step, and the disposal of trucks with explosives indicates that the occupiers are preparing to produce any scenarios. In fact, the Russians use the nuclear station as an international influence for blackmail not only Ukraine but the world but the world ", -the mayor.

For some time, they were able to evacuate through the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, but the NPP workers were not missed - the Russians had their lists.

Since Energodar is located on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir, Ukrainian mobile operators are able to "break through" to the upper floors of high -rise buildings. "In this way, residents are able to receive objective information by connecting pre-ternet sources, Ukrainian telegrams," Orlov said.
However, according to him, the invaders block Ukrainian TV channels and radio, and have taken control of all online resources. Therefore, propaganda has been working there for more than a year and for residents who do not have access to objective channels of information, it is not very difficult to fall under the influence of propaganda information resources. "
Orlov also noted that the Russian military now "not very active" moves in Energodar . At the same time, increasing searches may indicate the preparation of the invaders of the good "goodwill gesture".
As reported by Ukrinform, on March 4, 2022, the Russians occupied the ZPP.
On June 22, 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared plans for a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

Russia has completely stopped the registration of the new fleet from June 26, which testifies to the pro -the same to disrupt food supply to the world markets.
About it reports Ministry of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.
29 ships that have to export 1.4 million tons of food mainly for the 5 countries of Asia and Africa, including China, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, blocked by Russia in Turkey's territorial waters.
In June, only 2 million tons were exported from Ukrainian ports. Another 1 million tons of food will either load or have already been partially loaded on 13 ships - the last registered in the initiative. If you do not restore the registration, the grain agreement will be completely stopped.
In 11 months, 45 countries received 32.5 million tons of food. An additional 25 million tons of tonnes did not receive the world due to sabotage. But even with these indicators, according to the UN, it was possible to reduce the world prices for food by 22%. This is a direct evidence that the grain agreement is needed by the world.
We support a statement of the Joint Coordination Center that all parties should be adequately accessed by vessels for food export, because it is a food danger to the entire world market. Only joint guns is able to stop Russia's food.
We urge partners under the agreement and all countries of the civilized world to defend the right to food. Ukraine, for its part, will also defend the right of a prominent trade navigation, which is recorded in international conventions.

About the middle of last year, there is a trend of growth of attack attacks on the supply chain(supply chain attacks). Йдеться,зокрема, про ІТ-компанії, що розробляють рішення для критичної інфраструктури.
Про це повідомляє State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine.
For IT companies and specialized software developers, such attacks are the first reputational threat and risks of losing customers in the future, while for critical infrastructure, the effects of such attacks can be more serious.
Often, specialized software developers and technological companies mistakenly consider it sufficiently protected and capable of resisting threats on their own - it is impossible in the modern world every time, after we see the breakdowns of such companies as Uber, Fireeye and others. Such underestimation of risks can lead to the pre -compromination of the entire supply chain and unprecedented impact on all clients.
Cyber resistance of critical infrastructure depends on whether the objects of critical infrastructure detect and lock trycomprotation and whether the code and infrastructure audit are performed. Unfortunately, many do not realize this. Therefore, it is important that the relevant requirements for cyber defense companies-suppliers of critical infrastructure are enshrined in the name.

_ for health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ 
Today-in Odessa, first of all, in order to congratulate our warriors of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional day. Greetings for courage, for heroism, for the extremely cool results for Ukraine they have acquired and acquired.
It is enough to mention what ambitions were in Russia at the beginning of a full -scale aggression and which of those ambitions are now at the bottom of the Black Sea.
I thank every warrior of the Navy of Ukraine-all the sailors, all the Music, all the commanders of our Navy, artillerymen, marine aviators, drone operators, thank the soldiers of the river fleet, river divisions ... I thank you all!
Today he was honored to reward the best, congratulated the cadets of the Institute of Institute of Navy of our Odessa Maritime Academy. He visited the wounded in the hospital. I wish everyone a speedy recovery. And it was a special honorable me-to leave a wish on a copy of Kobzar, which accompanies our military in the battles since the 14th year.
There was also a report of our commander of the Naval Forces Vice-Admiral Alexei Zhpapa, as well as the commander of Odessa, Generalamskalov.
