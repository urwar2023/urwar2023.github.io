<p>About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/605">wrote</a>In Telegram:</p>
<p>“Finally, since 2014, Ukraine has raised a rigid and legally competent question of the correspondence of the Russian Federation for the war.</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the Buchan Summit of Faces of Justice, dedicated to the discussion of the prosecution of the aggressor state to the comprehensive responsibility of the Ukrainian people and humanity, President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky clearly expressed our state position on this issue.</p>
<p>Three levels of court proceedings are the National, International Criminal Court of Ispets tribunal.</p>
<p>And most importantly, the responsibility of the Russian Federation should be carried out primarily for aggression - as an primary crime.</p>
<p>After all, the main crime committed by the Russian Federation since 2014 is the crime of aggression(Domestic - war).</p>
<p>А воєнні злочини, злочини проти людяності, геноцид — похідні наразі.</p>
<p>На жаль, попереднє керівництво України займало непробачно м‘яку позицію щодопритягнення РФ до відповідальності і взагалі не подало нікуди жодного позовучи заяви щодо вчинення РФ саме агресії.</p>
<p>Влада і сама не називала це війною (ATO, OOS)Therefore, we were limited to the statements of the international institutions only on terrorism and war crimes.</p>
<p>In the end, we just spent a few years. And for the investigation of crimes - the cyinodes are fatal.</p>
<p>The requirement of Ukraine to create a special priorbun on the crime of aggression of the Russian Federation is a very strong position. Very!</p>
<p>Because since the Nuremberg process, international courts have no longer expelled for aggression.</p>
<p>Only for the derivative of her crimes.</p>
<p>International law and international courts work so poor.</p>
<p>Of course, there has never been enough international political consolidation, and there is a always war.</p>
<p>The only thing that was done since 2014 was the forces of brave Ukrainian judges to build 17 sentences for aggression within national justice.</p>
<p>The brave - because legally there was an ATO, and they wrote in the sentences - "aggression" was properly qualified.</p>
<p>At that time, I taught the qualification of crimes in the National School of Judges in zoning actions and was relevant to the development of this approach - how to qualify RFSAM actions under Article 437 of the Criminal Code "Planning, preparation, solving and maintaining an aggressive war".</p>
<p>I remember how many debates in the legal community that could not be contrary to the approaches of international humanitarian law that the subject of the crime is not.Moreover, our judges then made incredible and documented even information operations as one of the signs of war.</p>
<p>And finally, it is not a separate position of bold judges, but a clear and rigid state position of Ukraine.</p>
<p>It's a difficult way. But now he will show well - whether the world is ready to consolidate and punish wars for them. "</p>

<p>About it in <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-1-2023"></a>reports the Institute of War Study(Isw), reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Russian military bloggers stated that on March 30, the Russian Defense Ministry dismissed the commander of the Russian Air Force, Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, after the Ministry of Defense, replaced him on January 13, Lieutenant General Makarevich.</p>
<p>In the Defense Ministry <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>Never confirmed the release of Teplinsky and probably sent him on vacation to be able to withdraw the Colonel General for command of the Air Force when he considers it necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, Russian military bloggers claimed that Teplinsky immediately released to the headquarters of the Russian United Group in Rostov-on-Donurasnodar Territory to accept the command of the Air Force, and that he was already planning operations. One blogger claimed that the Chief of Staff of Sukrobutnivsk and the former Commander of the Central Military District(Cvo)Colonel-General Alexander Lapin flew together with Teplinsky.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation replaced Lapin with Lieutenant General Andriy Mordichev as a CBO commander on February 17 after Public Criticism of Lapin under his management of Svatove-Kremen in the fall of 2022.</p>
<p>“It remains to see whether Lapina will renew in the post of commander(Russian - ed.)Forces in Ukraine, ”writes ISW.</p>
<p>Starting on March 27, Russian sources have suggested that the Russian Defense Ministry has recently released the commander of the Eastern Military District(All)Colonel-General Rustam Muradov in response to a sharp criticism of his command in connection with the significant losses of the Russian army in the offensive operations under the coledar earlier this year.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, the head of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people Chubarov said on the air of public radio.</p>
<p>“We know that the Russian occupation authorities are now experiencing big problems with the understanding of a planned number of people for the spring call, which has begun from yesterday. The fact is that prior to this recruitment troops, in January-February, they carried out work on the total clarification of questionnaires. This suggests that they are aimed at gathering thicifars that are "lowered" by Moscow. But I am convinced that they will not be able to recruit people in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-krim"></a>”, - said Chubarov.</p>
<p>According to him, the occupiers will be looking for a contingent for the military company of Storalier. In particular, there is already information about one of these cases in one of the colonies of the Russian Federation in the city on the Volga.</p>
<p>“A wave of hidden mobilization has subsided now. However, military enlistment offices work, causing men to clarify data. It keeps people in some tension, so many who left Crimea in September, October, November, and December last year to avoid forced mobilization, do not return to the peninsula. They have come to the lists, ”Chubarov added.</p>

<p>About it in the next <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-1-2023"></a>reports the Institute of War Study(Isw), reports Ukrinform.</p>

<p>In Paris, scooters are popular with young people to overcome small distances. After a chaotic introduction of this transport in 2018, the city authorities have increased the rules of their operation in 2018, creating special zone parking, limiting the maximum speed and number of those who go.</p>
<p>As RFI notes, every day in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-francia"></a>About 100,000 trips in nearly 200,000 trips and towns and towns of the country are worn.</p>
<p>But scooters remain a contradictory topic: pedestrians complain of careless water, and fatal accidents show the danger of using these vehicles that children aged 16 years of age have the right to rent in France.</p>
<p>The mayor of Paris Ann Idalgo calls the vote initiated by the city authorities, unfereed, and "public consultations". It stands for the prohibition of electrics, which she calls a "source of tension and anxiety" for the locals.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, the head of the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people Chubarov said on the air of public radio.</p>
<p>“We know that the Russian occupation authorities are now experiencing big problems with the understanding of a planned number of people for the spring call, which has begun from yesterday. The fact is that prior to this recruitment troops, in January-February, they carried out work on the total clarification of questionnaires. This suggests that they are aimed at gathering thicifars that are "lowered" by Moscow. But I am convinced that they will not be able to recruit people in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-krim"></a>”, - said Chubarov.</p>
<p>According to him, the occupiers will be looking for a contingent for the military company of Storalier. In particular, there is already information about one of these cases in one of the colonies of the Russian Federation in the city on the Volga.</p>
<p>“A wave of hidden mobilization has subsided now. However, military enlistment offices work, causing men to clarify data.

<p>About it in <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-1-2023"></a>reports the Institute of War Study(Isw), reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Russian military bloggers stated that on March 30, the Russian Defense Ministry dismissed the commander of the Russian Air Force, Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, after the Ministry of Defense, replaced him on January 13, Lieutenant General Makarevich.</p>
<p>In the Defense Ministry <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>Never confirmed the release of Teplinsky and probably sent him on vacation to be able to withdraw the Colonel General for command of the Air Force when he considers it necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, Russian military bloggers claimed that Teplinsky immediately released to the headquarters of the Russian United Group in Rostov-on-Donurasnodar Territory to accept the command of the Air Force, and that he was already planning operations. One blogger claimed that the Chief of Staff of Sukrobutnivsk and the former Commander of the Central Military District(Cvo)Colonel-General Alexander Lapin flew together with Teplinsky.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation replaced Lapin with Lieutenant General Andriy Mordichev as a CBO commander on February 17 after Public Criticism of Lapin under his management of Svatove-Kremen in the fall of 2022.</p>
<p>“It remains to see whether Lapina will renew in the post of commander(Russian - ed.)Forces in Ukraine, ”writes ISW.</p>
<p>Starting on March 27, Russian sources have suggested that the Russian Defense Ministry has recently released the commander of the Eastern Military District(All)Colonel-General Rustam Muradov in response to a sharp criticism of his command in connection with the significant losses of the Russian army in the offensive operations under the coledar earlier this year.</p>

<p>The White Angel Evacuation Group exports residents on armored cops. To help everyone quickly respond to shelling, police formed additional products.</p>
<p>Evacuation occurs under the coordination of Donetsk ova, also involved in the SES rescuers. About 1900 residents remain in Avdiivka. Most of them live in the private sector in the old part of the city. In addition to the White Angels, the Red Zone is directed by police detachments. The task of law enforcement officers is instant assistance to the population during air strikes and artillery attacks, the number of which has increased significantly.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T57-00-00-04-00/642805cb051c4568278921.jpg" />Avdiivka streets are extinct. People come out of shelters only for food, water. But every way out is a deadly risk. “Recently, the woman died when she went to the well to collect water. The man was injured, ”says Gennady Yudin, a member of the White Angel crew.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T57-00-00-04-00/642805d49bcca427716354.jpg" />To travel to the right address, the police officer is forced to first clear the road from pieces of concrete and plastic - what was previously a house. Gennady's shells and fragments carefully go around. In an armored car - coal wheels, medical tools, children's bulletproof vests. Everything that may be needed for salvation.</p>
<p>This time, the police evacuated the elderly, who were asked to take away their natives who left earlier. One of the inhabitants first planted the cat on the cat by the Taadvorov Dog Aleska, for which he looked after and took with him to a safe place. It was very scary, ” - says another passenger.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T57-00-00-04-00/642805d49ac38245462836.jpg" />Both "white angels" - locals and understand the residents, because their families also experience the same. "My grandmother lived here on the fifth floor," shows Dmitry Solovaya, the Believed House "White Angel".</p>
<p>Police traveled locations where people can be extinguished. In addition, the route checked the property in broken stores where masters can operate. After the missile strike, the angels were found on the ground a shabby, Alevtsy Flag and returned it to the place of fluttering as a symbol of unbroken Avdiivka.While this material was being prepared, a tragedy occurred in Avdiivka-a 5-month-old baby and his grandmother were fired. Parents are hospitalized with injuries. The back before the arrival, the police persuaded their mother to leave and save the baby. Tsebula is not the first attempt to convince the woman, but in vain. The enemy is chaotic of life -long houses, so the only way to survive is to evacuate until it is too late.</p>

The main argumentist media is that the Ukrainian unicorn is not intended for commercial implementation, which is regulated by the regulatory acts of the Armed Forces.

The exhibited sample is only a variant of possible sewing.</p>

<ul>
<li>The fact that the enemy has not been able to achieve significant success of the Nabakhmut direction for a long time testifies to the unbreakable will of our defenders, their learning, mutual support, incredible courage and heroism, - the opponent of the Eastern Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also worth noting the more powerful work of our commander, commanders of I andsta. They constantly take non -standard active defense measures, use the most effective weapons of the Soviet sample as effectively as possible, as well as modern Western samples, create a system of continuous observation by the enemy with the help of unmanned aircraft. Thanks to see all the movements of the enemy, destroy his personnel and equipment, strike the logistics centers. It is aggregate to dismantle the plots of the invaders and forces them to constantly review the territory of Ukraine. They have not achieved their goal to go to the borders of Dononets and Luhansk regions until March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>However, despite numerous losses, the enemy continues to take offensive actions of Bakhmut and Kupyansk. According to the spokesman, in the last day of the Nabakhmut direction, the enemy fired at Ukrainian positions with different artillery 232 times. In Kupyansk and Liman directions, 252 shelling and 6 combatants were recorded, during which 36 invaders were destroyed, and 74 were wounded.</p>
<p>When asked about the likelihood of using the fourth generation of Su-35 in the eastern direction of the Russian Federation, the spokesman of the group emphasized that the efficiency uses them, but the tactics of their use differs little by the extraordinary Soviet models.</p>
<ul>
<li>They try to act on a pattern: on the rise to our positions release non -exposed missiles or dump aircraft and quickly flee away from the previous edge, so as not to get under the defeat of our air defense, - added Sergei Cherevaty.</li>

<p>The spokesman for the Eastern Grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Sergeycheriev in a comment to Military Media Center said that the change of the leadership of the Russian so -called "military operation" in Ukraine "strategically changed nothing."</p>
<p>It should be reminded that the head of the General Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov adopted personal command of combat actions in the territory of Ukraine on January 11, 2023.</p>
<p>The British Ministry of Defense summarized that since then Gerasimov has tried to develop a wide offensive in order to take control of all Donbas. However, 80 days ago, "it becomes more obvious that this project has failed."</p>
<p>According to Sergei Cherevatov, the plans of the Russian command are thwarted because of "significant losses among Russian invaders."</p>
<p>And to the loss, according to the spokesman, it led that the enemy was mistaken for the extratergic plan and "trying to take occupation actions for several days in reality faced more than the annual war."</p>
<p>"Therefore, he was forced to act no longer proactively, but reactive, that is, the reacting events that took place, first of all, due to the total resistance of the Ukrainian military and all the Ukrainian people," Sergiycherievaty said.</p>
<p>According to him, the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of Russians and other measures took place in the ambulance regime, in the mode of effort to adjust the military engineer under the assaults of military-political leadership.</p>
<p>Among them, the use of "absolutely unacceptable for the war of new generations as involvement of prisoners, who were attacked by attack as a cannon."</p>
<p>Cherevaty noted that this led to a "deplorable result", when the enemy could not take the Ukrainian district center Bakhmut.</p>
<p>Bakhmut has become "a world -renowned symbol on the one hand of Ukrainian courage, indomitable and professionalism, and on the other hand - the absolute helplessness of the occupants of the occupiers," said Sergey Cherevaty.</p>
<p>The British Defense Office noted that in several directions of the Nadonbas Front, Russian troops achieved only minor successes at the cost of tens of thousands of losses and largely waste their temporary advantage in the personnel, obtained as a result of the autumn "partial mobilization"."Career growth is not built there on professional qualities, everything is built out there on the" first boss ". At this moment, Russia has no quality professional higher generality, ”said Petro Chernik.</p>
<p>Therefore, he said, from the change of military leaders from the Russians is not at the front.</p>
<p>“They resorted to the classical Stalin's technique: Russian cannot be a repeated battlefield, how many soldiers' lives are needed - we will spend as much. They do it, ”the analyst said.</p>

<p>Those who beat the military should be brought to criminal responsibility. The patrols that have drawn up the military should be released.</p>
<p>After such events, those priests who have at least a part of the Ukrainian are obliged to immediately leave the FSBust structure. ”</p>

It is a joint journal of Ukraine under the Stable Ukraine program, which is over six years old and is intended to help Ukrainians become stronger and more resistant to the crisis of military threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>We very much hope that in the near future, Ukraine will be able to overlide its territories. However, I do not see that this war will end very fast. Because Russia is still a huge country. They have enough weapons and equipment, so perhaps not the most modern, but also many. Therefore, it is not a easy process <strong> liberation of their territories. But, this is </strong> <strong> The only way can now stop Russia and end war. And we, for our part, have to do everything on us dependent, everything is possible to help Ukraine as much as possible in this </strong>. Estonia is constantly coming to convey this position to larger allies that occupy more significant positions, because Estonia is a small country enough to do it with their little neighbors on their own.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/1-3-1-scaled.jpg" />Today, in the center of Borodyanka, an art sculpture "Girl under the Sun" was solemnly opened. These days, we remember the anniversary of the liberation of the Kyiv region of sprouting invaders. A new work of art shows the indomitability of Ukrainians who, in the case of the injuries of the war, resolved by Russia, continue to live and fight. The correspondent of the Armyinform visited the discovery and told the main one from the event.</p>
<p>In 2022, a famous photo of a girl was taken on a phony of a multi -storey building in Borodyanka. 11-year-old Alina became symbolism against the background of the Russian-Ukrainian war. Therefore, the idea came up to create a sculpture that would, despite everything, symbolize struggle and life.</p>
<p>The presenter, the moderator of the solemn opening of the sculpture, producer of Radio "Culture" Irina Slavinskaya told the history of photos and feelings that were in the Ukrainians a year ago. Then we learned about the horrors of Russian military crimes of Nakyiv region - in Bucha, Irpen, Borodyanka…</p>
<p>“And probably one of the most striking images of that unmotivated violence is Shevchenko's monument here, quite near us, in the center of Borodyanka. His then was shot by Russian invaders. They also attacked ordinary civilians.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/2-1-2.jpg" />It's a photo(<em>divchin. - ed .</em>)- Documentary evidence that life is overcomes is a powerful contrast. And the photo was the inspiration for the sculpture, which we are opening today. It is a symbol of our resistance, resistance and insignificance. And, of course, not only the Kyiv region, but all Ukraine, ”Irinawinskaya said.</p>
<p>The US Ambassador in Ukraine Bridget Brinka expressed the words of confidence that the connected states will continue to support our country. And also that all wine crimes will be held accountable.</p>
<p>“The work of the sculptor Yevgeny Primachenko testifies to the cruel events that the Russians have committed. And also about the insurmountable spirit that I even feel with you, in the center of Borodyanka.</p>
<p>This work is evidenced by the fact that I see every minute since I came to Ukraine - your desire to be free.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/3-2-1-scaled.jpg" />Ever since the Borodyanka has passed, I am here with you to support the unwavering support of the United States because we will be responsible for those who are guilty of this.Deputy Head of Office Alexei Kuleba noted:</p>
<p>“This year was, of course, difficult. And I think that we cannot even teach and understand that you have been able to survive.</p>
<p>What happened in Borodyanka is another proof that Russia-terrorist. This is our mission, it is our task for us to understand that the war is and will be victorious for us.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/4-2-scaled.jpg" />Together we will rebuild Borodyanka, rebuild the Kyiv region, and we will develop all of Ukraine. ”</p>
<p>Dmitry Nazarenko, a temporary acting head of the Kyiv Regional Regional Administration, emphasized the following:</p>
<p>“Today is the main goal - this is a victory. As then our brave armed forces expelled the insidious enemy from the Kiev region by other military formations. So we will expel from the whole territory of a sovereign, unbreakable Ukraine. ”</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/5-1-scaled-e1680456541354.jpg" />Actually, the author of the work, the sculptor Yevgeny Primachenko revealed the meaning of the characters that were laid in the sculpture:</p>
<p>“There was the only desire to make a monument to the victims. On the contrary - to put in the tusks the meaning of life, restoration, revival, and that it may have some positive, good symbol for people. Since the place is quite difficult, and we will understand that many horrific things have happened here, many people have been injured.</p>
<p>For me, the image of the sun is a symbol of life, light and joy. Therefore, here we have a combp of yellow inserts, which symbolize the sun. The arches themselves form a dose, because it wanted to make it meaning that it was not just sunlight. And forming a protection dome, because we all lack a sense of security and protection. The girl is already so dynamic. It symbolizes movement forward, recovery. "</p>
<p>The temporary acting chairman of the Borodyansky settlement chairman Georgy Erkhada was that the victims of Russian occupation in the community became whole families with 8 children.</p>
<p>“The sculpture is a symbol that our children, our future will be cloudless, will be war. That our armed forces will defeat, ”Georgiyerko said confidently.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T96-00-00-04-00/6-scaled.jpg" />The heroine of photo and sculpture, 11-year-old Alina, was also with her mother. Despite the rain, all present had a solar mood because they realized that life was going on. And the struggle too, and the victory will be. According to Ukraine.<em>Foto Igor Babinets</em></p>

<p>About it during the presentation of the analytical report "Inter -Sectoral Cooperation: a lesson of the way to a sustainable society"(The joint work of Estonia and Ukraine with the program "Stable Ukraine")What happened in Kiev recently told the Director of the International Defense and Security Center(ICDS)In Tallinn, EXCEMENT OF ESTON DEPRUE Minister of Defense(1994)Indrek Kannik.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our role to explain that a compromise with the current leadership of Russia is unfortunate. Because compromise Russians consider the weakness of another country and the opportunity to go on. That is why we need to support Ukrainian as much as it takes and so long as it will take, - said the index.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also noted that it is not necessary to be too much afraid of Russia, because in many times it only blackmails other countries.</p>
<p>-I see that in many capitals of Europe and in the United States of America, there are significant fears, in particular, in the nuclear issue. They see a big risk factor in this and, of course, this is an important question. On the other hand, we also mibbon that Russia uses it as blackmail, as intimidation of other countries. So it is very important to keep the balance in this matter. After all, if we listen to what Russia says, then we can not, after all, do nothing. Because they will first say: "If you do not give Kiev, then we are a nuclear weapon," and then they will say the same thing about Warsaw, then by Berlin, Paris or any other capital of Europe. Therefore, they cannot be taken seriously in this matter, - said Indrek Kannik.</p>
<p>He has evolved that Estonia was trying to explain to the countries of Europe and the United States regarding the Russian policy of the Russians, and in view of this, the importance of Ukraine's accession to the NATO Alliance.</p>

One of the important is the thesis that Ukraine needs to help as much as it needs it.</p>
<p>And we also try to think about the future of Ukraine after the war. And here, in our opinion, it is that Ukraine has exactly NATO and the EU. Because otherwise this aggression can be repeated.<strong> In the </strong> economic sense, this society has remained behind other countries for a long time <strong>. The latest successful achievements they had was the flight of Yuriagagarin - a Ukrainian, by the way. And after that there is nothing. It remains that you can terrorize the weapons and blackmails of smaller and possibly weaker neighbors. They have become just national pride, honor, because, as the assault, they left nothing else </strong>.</p>
<p>How to change it? Unfortunately, I don't have answers. Russia has to cut it itself. We cannot do this, we can only protect ourselves from them, "said Indrek Kannik.</p>
