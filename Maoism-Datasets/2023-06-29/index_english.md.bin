Wagner PVC is a military organization founded in 2014, which uses a growing tactic around the world. Estonia, Lithuania and Parliament of France have identified it with a terrorist organization. The French Parliament has called on the Esophically to recognize the Russian group of "Wagner" mercenaries terrorist, and it is a sign that the United Kingdom also plans to recognize this company terrorist.

The Wagner group uses Russian government funds to spread around the world and people's deaths. The company's mercenaries committed numerous crimes in Ukraine, supported the bloody Bashar al -Assad regime in Syria in the TAZs are accused of committing numerous atrocities and war crimes in Mali, Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya.

Considering that the company is funded directly from the Russian State Budget, any company operating within the Russian jurisdiction is at risk of facilitating terrorism and financing for organized traffic. International companies that continue to conduct business and pay taxes in Russia indirectly contribute to Wagner's financing. Financial institutions and other entities outside Russia, which deals with the funds received from in different countries, assistance in the supply and financing of a criminal group, as well as participation of non -consumer trade.At the same time, a group of mercenaries is illegal in Russia, according to the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

The Secretary General of the United Nations in his report on children of armed conflict for 2023 considers Russia and its settings responsible for the murder of Ukrainian children, as well as for attacks at hospital and school. About it [reports](https://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/posts/pro-vklyucennya-rosiyi-do-spisku-ganbi-yak-storoni-zbroinogo-konfliktu-vidpovidalnoyi-za-seriozni-porusennya-prav-ditei)Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.

The inclusion of the Secretary General of Russia-P5 member in the annual "List of Shame" as parties of the armed conflict responsible for serious violations of children is an important notice to the aggressor state and criminals involved in the committing atrocities in relation to children: such actions are not permitted and are not worried.

The report also refers to the movement of Ukrainian children to Russia and the navigated territories with a call to Russia to act in the best interests of the child - to contribute to the reunification of the family, while guaranteeing that their citizenship is not building. This is in line with the problem of compulsory deportation of Ukrainian children in Russia - an international crime, which was in fact that the international criminal judgment was arrested for the arrest of President Putin this year.

We urge the United Nations to closely monitor Russia's actions, and as well as the measures that it pledged to take to improve the protection of Ukrainian children under its effective control.

There is currently no such progress: according to our latest estimates, in the beginning of full -scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, 493 children were killed and 1033 were injured, almost 20,000 children have been forcibly deported. These are only those cases that are listed in criminal proceedings. These figures do not include temporarily occupied territories, so real figures can be significantly high. In total, in Ukraine, law enforcement agencies are investigating more than 3,000 rays against children.

The international community should be remembered that the desire for peace can not be identified by the victim and the aggressor, since the act of aggression of Russia has led to an armed conflict and continuous commission of cruel crimes in Ukraine by its forces and settings.The Office of the Prosecutor General is working closely with the UN International International Investigation Commission on Ukraine, providing information on the forced movement of Ukrainian children and other serious violations of children's rights from September 2022. Two meetings have been carried out and one request for information was provided. crimes committed against children in the course of Russian aggression.

In Ukraine, a working group was created at the state level on interaction of the special representative of the UN Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflicts. In the course of its work, the Office of the Prosecutor General provides information on severe violations of children by Russia.

Our prosecutors are in contact with experts of the International Criminal Court. More than 40 volumes of cases of cases have been transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 30 requests for the protection of evidence, information and investigative actions have been fulfilled.

We also cooperate with the experts of the Moscow OSCE mechanism. The latest report of the Soming mechanism was dedicated to the protection of the rights of deported Ukrainian children. During its training, the OSCE experts held meetings with prosecutors who carry out procedural guidance in criminal proceedings on the deportation of children and other international crimes committed against children.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-28T82-00-00-04-00/oleksandr_pavlyuk.jpg)This was emphasized by the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine General-General Pavlyuk during the "Uniform News" Tele scale.

- Yes, I have got the task from the President of Ukraine to create a working group. This is very important, because there is a lot of negative activity in the information space. The working group has already been created by the power block, namely: NAPC, DBR, SBU and National Police, which will be able to check on its issues. A group of armed forces has also been created to analyze the performance of service tasks - reported Pavlyuk.

He added that law enforcement agencies, among other things, will carefully check the responsibility of the lifestyle of the CCC and JV officials to those data in their declarations.

- The main thing in this work is not to interfere with the task of mobilizing. Why? First of all, we know well what was more attention to the Russian agency in 2014. It was to the mobilization processes. At the end of 2013, the system of military enlistment offices was only destroyed, which was not able to perform these important tasks. Therefore, it is not possible to allow this check to harm the execution of the basic tasks,-said Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk.

According to him, the Russian agency still works in the direction of creation of fakes in the activities of the Tax Code and JV. Therefore, it is necessary to check any information only by official sources. Unfortunately, some Ukrainian media fall into the information hook of the invaders.

- When analyzing all these processes, one must carefully approach the truth of other information. There are now many measures to improve confidence. Thus, 253 people have been gaminated for various reasons for various reasons. But it's not dogma. After all, just the replacement will be ineffective if the system does not work correctly, - said the defender of Ukraine.

He said that the servicemen of the Tax Code and JV were constantly sent to the front by a landing replacement with those who had a fighting or a fighting injury there.

- It is necessary to understand well that the Russians are not going to just give the thumbnails that have already captured. They use all tools: blasting Dambikakhovsky hydroelectric power plant, nuclear rhetoric, mines and more. Here it is important to correctly evaluate our offensive actions. It is not only the measurement of a kilometers of targeting the number of released settlements. The military is performing considerable tasks. For example, they perform the task of reducing the offensive of the enemy. If we talk about last week, 110 places of concentration of Russian army were destroyed by our armed forces. Also eliminated 11 management and 7 field warehouses with Russian weapons, - told the painter.

She also noted that the enemy continues to resist in all directions of linefront.

- The armed forces are now confidently moving Mariupol and Berdyansk. Every day there is a forward promotion. For example, to speak Prokhnopil, on the one hand - it is a small settlement, but our arms have first have to fix themselves there. That is, some distance we have passed, Apothim is given several days to fix. This should be taken into account when you read the news about a counter -offensive. Therefore, everything lasts according to the plan. Literally in front of Cimfir, I contacted the commander of individual areas. Therefore, I can say that now Rivnopil is fully controlled, - Hannamaars assured.

She reported that the main direction of the enemy's offensive remains East.

- The invaders are suffered by significant losses there. But here it should be understood that by the word "loss" our military implies: the fallen invaders wounded in captivity. Speaking about the current composition of the invaders, the Wagner PEC does not fight on the front. By the way, the Wagnerivtsi was threatened with shooting and periodically. Instead, other PECs and regular Russian, as we know, do not use such "motivation". The occupiers will be less confident in the war for them if they are undone in the back, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

First of all - about yesterday's Russian blow to Kramatorsk. Work on the site of the terrorist attack continued this. Unfortunately, the death toll increased. My muddy native. More than 60 people were injured and injured.

Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, together with the police special forces, had a person who adjusts this blow to terrorists. Just on the cafe of Uzramatorsk, on the popular pizzeria. Damaged neighboring homes, shops, dressing. Ordinary city, ordinary life. Under the rubble can still be people.

Anyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves a naximal punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators there. Everything is clear. These are people without humanity. Everyone in the world who does not understand that it is impossible to be an accomplice of a terrorist state must respond to the entire international community. The corrector is under the article on state treason. Punishment - including lifelong. The accomplices of the terrorist state should be considered as traitors of humanity and humanity.

We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia's accomplices. They should feel that the price of their terror for them will be increased. And we will continue our global legal work so that the international instruments have worked for the punishment of all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself.

Today, in an appeal to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on the occasion of the Constitution Day, he was about justice. Internal justice is a responsibility for violation of law in Ukraine. And about the justice of communicating with the Russian-Ukrainian war is about the responsibility of the Russian war. Justice policy will be one of the basics of Ukrainian Dokrin - a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country of the year.Ukraine and all in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand on protection of justice. Justice for all whose lives were exposed to Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory of all people, all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian inhumans!

I want to report the day briefly now.

Presidents of Lithuania and Poland were a visit - Hitanas Nausede and Andrzej Duda.

A very timely and useful visit - on the eve of Vilnius. The format of negotiations is span and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, a panel, for the decision to buy and pass the NASAMS systems, it is very necessary. They discussed common political challenges - both in the region and international countries. Of course, they also talked about the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union, which we expect this year.

He met with the main master-holder of the 47th separate mechanized brigade "Magura" Valery Marcus. They talked to him about the war, about our warriors, I will have a defense.

They discussed, in particular, the accounting reform in military structures. Less paper of bureaucracy, more digitalization. They discussed the reform of the Sergeant Corps. Khorosh conversation. Thank you for the chevrons!

Today, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, I was honored to reward our soldiers and to transmit state awards to our heroes. Very emotionally, very honorable. I worship our warriors!I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine!

I congratulate everyone on the Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, everyone and every one of the state, only to multiply the will, glory and independence of Ukraine!And so will it!

I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of the Kurban Bayram holiday. We will all get peace for our country, for our countries, for our children.

Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone and everyone who is in battle, at combat posts and positions. Thank you, warriors, for new promotion first!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

He stated this by presenting the benchmarks of the future document with the Polyar Session of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of the Constitution Day of Ukraine. About it [reports](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/volodimir-zelenskij-zaproponuvav-osnovni-napryami-transforma-83905)The official website of the President of Ukraine.

"We have to go during this time such a path that other peoples have overcome for decades. Ukraine will have special attention, special trust in the world, and every manifestation of attention and trust should be focused on the development of Ukraine and all aspects in our country," the president stressed.

The first specific purpose for Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the GDP's achievement in a trillion dollars, and the potential of our country is able to suggest.

The second point is the rejection of the idea, as if the cheap work of Ukrainians is a competitive advantage.

"We aim to reach such a level of remuneration that could be brought to the formula" neighbors in the European Union plus 30%. " This is a fair goal, a war of war. Ukraine of victory will be a bet on qualified work. Aotge, for education, ”the Head of State said.

The President also emphasized the need to spread English, because it is a language of global cooperation, business, and science of taglobal communication.

The third crucial task, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, identified the return of the home of a large number of our citizens who went beyond the state. It is necessary to create as many jobs as possible.

"The transformation of every sector of the economy, any social practice and all spheres of public administration should answer the question: how many new workplace will give Ukraine a specific decision, a specific initiative," he said.

The President also advocated the formation of a new policy of support of paternity. According to the head of state, the second and third child in the family should be happiness, not restriction of opportunities.

To help families, a special application "Dream" will be created, which will support everything concerning parents and children: services that are needed for children, the child for development, education, security, contact with the state, etc. The digital transformation team of Ukraine will present the application in the fall, Vladimir Zelensky reported.“Everyone who creates new jobs in Ukraine creates the basis for economic leadership of Ukraine. Ukraine of victory will protect every person's ability to work as much and as a person desires. We need to summarize the labor legislation, ”he said.

The seventh point of transformation of the state, according to the President, has a stalkin rational tax agreement between the state and society and the real -alienation of property.

“I am a supporter of tax reductions. But now, during such a war and the obvious dependence of Ukraine on cooperation with financial donors, we cannot allow ourselves to reduce taxes. But when Ukraine of victory itself becomes a member for the world, our level of opportunity will be higher. Reduced taxes have to determine the increased tax honesty, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

He noted that digitalization gives enormous opportunities to simplify the relation of taxes, customs and other industries, where there is a meeting or any contact between a citizen and an official, a businessman and an official. Therefore, we need to seek automatic digital procedures in these areas.

There will be a reconstruction of Ukraine within the transformation, so after the victory, the country will become the largest construction site in Europe.

“We need to rebuild hundreds of cities and villages, thousands of infrastructure, hundreds of thousands of houses. This will give your impetus to the economy. We have to forget about our own exporter of raw materials. Victory Ukraine is a country of high cost goods. It is a country in which regulations are allowed to develop any business innovators in their fields, in their directions, and in which it is protected by intellectual property. Ukraine Victory is a country that exports security, services, experiences, culture and in general the results of intellectual activity, technological products more than any raw material, ”the President said.

Our state will also develop cooperation and economic relations with all maklobal players, including India, Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, with China, and Ukraine's energy potential allows you to be one of Europe's energy security guarantors, in particular through the development President.

In addition, Ukraine's victory should become a country that has implemented a pension reform so that anyone who works today has decent support in the future. In this context, Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the MPs with a job to implement steps to ensure this reform.“Now the cultural sphere requires at least a percentage of GDP a year - as a basic level for survival. But it is clear that the industry must and should be more ambitious. Ukrainian courage really awakened the enormous interest of people of the various countries in us, to us, to Ukrainians, to our cities and villages. Every such interest is opportunities, ”he said.

According to the Head of State, Ukrainian society also requires a new policy of public space protection in cities and communities, a new museum tamemorial policy, a new policy of books and book publishers, writing, translations, translations for Ukraine foreign books and dissemination in the world of Ukrainian, Ukrainian books, and Ukrainian books. digital subscriptions, rethinking of our libraries and more.

In addition, Ukraine needs a new movie policy and film support, asvates should make films about Ukraine and Ukraine.

The Head of State also drew attention to the need for a new policy of the territories for the closest from the Russian occupation of the region. It must be its own, descended and at the same time a coherent, visionary transformation policy.

The President emphasized the internal security.

“Russian aggression has shown what security standards are needed for life. The accessibility of shelters is maximum. School - with shelter. Hospital - with shelter. Business - with shelter. Ukrainians will trust specific things that give specific security, ”he stressed.

In this context, there is a need to regulate the issue of weapons that will and people, demining and providing needs for its conduct, the issue of daily safety of the population, etc.

The final landmark Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the neighborhood policy.

"Strong neighborhood is always the result of very different, very deep things. Phactically successful neighborhood we can summarize any other successes of the countryside, in our region and in global relations. Economy such culture. Defense and safety. Transport and communication. Education and attitude of prehistory. Interaction between states and interaction between us, between people ... All it determines the quality of the neighborhood. Determines whether there is an understanding between neighbors, ”the Glava of State summarized.

"I do not think that this norm will affect the Ukrainian film doubling, but I can see that we need to understand. We need to gather all those involved in this process and talk to it," the People's Deputy added.

In the context of securing the rights of Ukrainian citizens, Podtraev noted that at least two categories of people who are not very good at English, and people who are not very well -versed in English, and people who may not know English and not be able to read subtitles, will be injured. He stressed that the development of English in Ukraine should be promoted, but people cannot be deprived of the right to view [movies](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kino)Ukrainian in cinemas.

At the same time, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy emphasized that the legislative initiative "On the use of English in Ukraine"(№9432)"very good". He also expressed beliefs that it would not be a problem with its revision, including in the film.As reported by Ukrinform, June 28 [President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3728718-zelenskij-proponue-radi-zrobiti-anglijsku-odnieu-z-mov-miznarodnogo-spilkuvanna-v-ukraini.html)registered with the Verkhovna Rada the bill "On the use of English speaking to Ukraine"(№9432).

Серед іншого, проєктом закону передбачається офіційно закріпити статусанглійської мови як однієї з мов міжнародного спілкування в Україні, визначитикатегорії посад, кандидати на зайняття яких зобовʼязані володіти англійськоюмовою, унормувати особливості застосування англійської мови в роботі органівдержавної влади, органів влади Автономної Республіки Крим, органів місцевогосамоврядування, підрозділів екстреної допомоги населенню, під час перетинудержавного кордону, у сферах освіти, культури, транспорту, охорони здоровʼятощо.

У розділі законопроєкту про використання англійської мови в сфері культурийдеться про те, що іноземні фільми, мовою оригіналу яких є англійська, маютьдемонструватися в кінозалах мовою оригіналу із субтитруванням державною мовою.Ця норма викликала неоднозначну реакцію в суспільстві. Зокрема, член КомітетуВР з питань гуманітарної та інформаційної політики Володимир В‘ятрович(The European Solidarity Parliamentary faction)[stated](https://www.facebook.com/1217668243/posts/pfbid0oHTCD1geLzpVoW8Y8f91Jr4skvXS1q8H2hojbc2R9oybJA5T9GN3GBvMinUTzFZdl/)that this will actually lead to "destruction of Ukrainian film opplication as an industry", because, according to him, such films in "Almost 90%" cinemas. The People's Deput also emphasized the need to "thoroughly" refine the relevant document.

Kateryna Chueu, Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy, said about it on a roundtable in Ukrinform on the topic "Heritage stolen: find and return".

She noted that the issue of return [cultural](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kultura)Values in Ukraine “not new, in the same for state bodies”. According to her, the Ministry has been gathering information for many years, which in different ways are submitted by appropriate experts.

“There were attempts to organize different, including international, commissions, were qualified for restitution issues. Because in reality, if we talk about the cultural heritage of Ukraine, we have some part of the countries where the diaspora cematures, and some of them representatives of the Diaspora also wanted to blame here. There are such cases of transmission. There are subjects, the right of Ukraine to be proved at least, because it was, for example, the sales of the Soviet power, requisitions of Ukrainian museums, objects sold abroad, museum objects of high value, high artistic quality, historical value, etc. And there is, of course, what has settled in Russia, and the array of objects that is there, we do not even know exactly, ”Chueva said.

At the same time, according to her, Ukraine is aware of archaeological collections, qualified in the times of the Russian Empire, and was taken away from excavations in Ukraine. They also climbed to exhibitions from Ukrainian museums and did not return.

In the context of legal prospects for the return of Ukrainian values heard the case of "Scythian gold".

“From the point of view of legal practice, I think that many countries have observed the subject matter and analyzed the decisions of the Dutch courts of different levels. And now we have a decision of the Supreme Court in favor of Ukraine, it has a thorough analysis of Ukrainian and international legislation. The role -based legislation, which can be relied upon by foreign courts of international instance in making such decisions, is also extremely important, ”Chuev's emphasized.

According to its words, all this matters in the process of returning cultural values in Ukraine.

“What will relate to a return from Russia and even the moments of detecting these subjects, I think it will be much more difficult than we would like. And it depends on when and on what conditions Ukraine wins ... And what is the point that Russia itself will be at the time of the victory of Ukraine, I think, many will be determined in further processes, ”Chueva said.

In his turn, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Institute of the National Memorial Overadimir Tilishchak expressed the opinion that the unleashed war of Russia against the Ukrainians was primarily against the Ukrainian identity and aims to destroy its reconciling the Ukrainian heritage.

He emphasized that "speaking of those crimes committed today, we cannot and have the right to forget about the crimes of anti -cultural heritage in all its dimensions."

According to him, it is not only about the destruction of museums, cultural institutions, but "and outright looting, a candid robbery, which is carried out by the occupiers not over the last year or two, but in fact since 2014, with the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war, with the occupation of Crimea."“In fact, this robbery of cultural heritage is a purposeful activity of the occupies, is a systematic component of their occupation policy. And not just a robbery, but above all appropriation. And this appropriation of inheritance is really one of the goals of the war, because the war, which is unleashed by Russia with anti -Ukraine, it is solved primarily against Ukrainian identity and has to destroy this identity. And including because of the appropriation of its fall, ”Tilishchak said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-29T18-51-55-03-00/630_360_1656203184-625.jpg)The State Audit Service of Ukraine initiates changes to the legislation to ensure the effective control over the financing of the country's reconstruction.

About it during a public discussion on the topic: "Not on the drum: what purchases are in the wartime period" she said, answering the question of correspondentukrukrueform, Head of the State Audit Service Alla Basaleva.

She recalled that in a letter of intentions signed by Kyiv with the International Bulk Fund, the State Audit Service was determined by the main body that will control the issue of restoration.

"And we will initiate changes to the legislation that will effectively control the spending of funds. This is a common task(Executive Ico -Power - Ed.). Тому проситиму про зустрічі з усімапарламентськими фракціями й доводитиму свою позицію. Ми повинні зробитиконтроль в цій частині ефективним", - пояснила Басалаєва.

Йдеться, за її словами, про дуже чутливе для українського суспільства питання.Також важливо не втратити довіру міжнародних партнерів.

"Останнім часом була велика кількість міжнародних зустрічей. Теза партнерівєдина: "Гроші ми дамо - за належного фінансового контролю. Покажіть, яківажелі ви матимете у процесі відновлення", - наголосила очільницяДержаудитслужби.

При цьому моніторинг закупівель — єдиний в арсеналі служби інструмент, щопрацює превентивно, тобто, дозволяє запобігати порушенням, а не виявляти їхвже постфактум.

Одним з дієвих механізмів унеможливлення зловживань Басалаєва назвалаблокування Держказначейством руху грошей, якщо при проведенні закупівель булодопущено суттєві порушення. Пропонується законодавчо затвердити перелік такихпорушень.

“Якщо ми їх виявимо, це зазначатиметься в системі Прозорро й буде сигналом дляказначейства. Бо що відбувається зараз? [ Гроші](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-grosi)They went, they are very quickly mastered. Then our audits and audits will find that they are spent ineffectively. Transamation of law enforcement agencies. There will be criminal cases, there will be fixed collections, one of the suspects will sit in Vienna, but there is no money ... ”, - says the head of the State Audit Service.

Deputy Minister of Economy Nadiya Bigun, who also participated in the discussion of UMediacenter Ukraine-Ukrinform, agreed with the need to strengthen the control of public funds. At the same time, she warned against the "bends", and the tenders will be stopped for formal reasons - for example, because of mistakes.“We believe that the mechanism of locking payments by the Treasury must be made. After all, we see that within the framework of monitoring of public procurement - especially for the following periods - attention was often focused on formal violations, including procedural, which do not affect the economic effect. In fact, it is not a ground for termination of payments, ”the official is convinced.

According to the runner, all the procedures necessary for the reconstruction should be about time and compliance with time to purchase even difficult conditions.

“There is a request for recovery to be fast, people don't have time to wait. Therefore, it is necessary to find a mechanism for which payments would be stopped only at real risks, and not by any formal drive, which will certainly negatively indicate the tights of the work, ”the runner summed up.

**Дорогий Шарлю, дорогі колеги!**

Дуже дякую!Вітаю всіх вас, дякую за запрошення!

Цей тиждень я почав поїздкою на фронт у дві наші області – Донецьку таЗапорізьку. Там зараз зосереджено найбільше бойових операцій – якнаступальних, так і оборонних. Висока інтенсивність боїв, найвищий героїзмнаших людей!

Наші воїни – абсолютні молодці, і я пишаюся ними, кожним і кожною, хто заразна позиціях, хто відбиває російські штурми та знищує російських терористів.Нам вдається звільняти від окупантів нашу землю та людей, і це найголовніше.

Що успішнішими зараз будуть наші воїни, то надовше Росія перестане бутинебезпечною і для України, і для всієї нашої Європи.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-29T19-21-00-03-00/1688055858-859.jpeg)History demonstrates that unsuccessful aggression always makes dictatorships weak. We are now we see in Russia - we see such weakness we need. The weakness of Russia will be safe for others, and its defeat overcomes the problem of this war.

** Dear colleagues, partners!**

I am grateful to all of you who help our defense against Russian aggression!Thank you every air defense system - they really save lives. It's true. Thank the European initiative for a million shells for Ukraine, for our tanking and for all the defensive packages that were provided to our country. This is all really historical cooperation to protect Europe.

In particular, Ukraine is grateful to Lithuania and Poland, and we will not allow Russia or its terrorist groups to even try to break the safety and Polish peoples from Belarus. For Ukraine, partners' safety is also safety.

Yesterday, a visit to Ukraine was Mr. President of Lithuania Nausede and Mr President Duda, and we exchanged with them assessments of the situation in the territory of Belarus Tanavana.Another thing that is important to say today in a security context is sanctions.

I am grateful for the recently adopted eleventh sanctional package of the European Union, which prejudice the fair pressure policy on anyone who makes aggression possible and terror.

It is important not to stop in sanctions. The smaller the pauses, the less Russia will adapt to the pressure on it and come up with less than how to bypass sanctions. Thank you that the111 sanction package pays attention to the efforts of Russia to bypass the sanctions across the country, and this attention should be strengthened in the 12th EU sanction package.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-29T19-21-00-03-00/1688055911-446.jpeg)Unfortunately, many rockets that Russian terrorists now use against life in Ukraine have recently been produced and contain critical components that are made by the free world companies. You cannot put up with this. We must combine the use of the free world technologies for the sake of aggression opposite freedom.

It is impossible to endure what Russia does with our Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant. Let me remind you that it is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russian terrorists found it. We have specific information from our intelligence, and we have presented, in particular, diplomats of European countries. As it is, by the way, information of Russia's prosecution for foreign components for missile production. The Russian anatomical industry deserves sanctions in response to Russian radiation blackmail.

**Dear colleagues!**

Tomorrow is coming to the EU Swedish presidency, and I want to thank Sweden to Mr. Prime Minister Christverson for their effective work. For these six months, it became stronger. I am sure of that.

On behalf of all Ukrainians, I want to thank you, dear leaders, and you, Charles, you, Ursulo, you, Roberto, for making extremely important economic and political decisions that help us protect freedom and Europe.

Unfortunately, there are things that don't help us. But if solidarity is sufficient, if our security and economic cooperation is not broken by artificial illegal restrictions, if the long -term and principled decisions of Europe, Ynadali, will signals the world that Europe believes in peace, then this war will definitely be worried.Finally, a few thoughts about the next six months for Europe. I believe that this Saturday, on the first day of Spain's presidency in the EU, for my request, Ukraine will visit Mr. Prime Minister of Spain Sanchez. It is a lot about how important it is for our Europe.

It is a historical time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Evrop of values, free and strong Europe, Europe of peace is unthinkable without Ukraine. We are ready for membership negotiations, and our progress is necessary to record the European Commission. Ukraine is set up as soon as possible to prepare for the start of merging about membership, and we will do it.

Peace has no alternatives. Therefore, the maximum unity in Europe has no alternatives.

Thank you for your attention!Thank you for the support, friends!

**Glory to Ukraine!**

About it in your [appeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6ehr_trUEs)At the end of the 491st of the war, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

I finish the day in the Verkhovna Rada - meeting with our speaker Ruslanstefanchuk. We work.

And now the report for this day, a busy day. Very long.

The meeting of the European Council is traditionally for Ukraine to be among the members of the Evrosouz. The agenda is obvious - our defense in this war, our path, the support from our partners, our security support for them for our Europe. Ukraine influences the power of Europe. This is a fact. And this year, on the basis of this and other similar facts, unity in Europe, including the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union.

Meeting with Mike Penso, 48th vice-resident, senator ... American support for Ukraine is vital for Ukraine-from all Americans, every American family, all US public forces, all political leaders, congress-both parties, of course, from US President Biden. Thank you for your feast!

He discussed our defense with Mr. Penso, our interaction - from the very beginning, pre -days between the Ukrainian and American peoples. They talked about the weapons, the projection of our soldiers, about our common values.

Meeting with members of the International Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of the War - Greta Tumbberg, Margot Walstrom and others. They talked primarily about Russian thermal and ecocide at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station and, in general, about the work of our group, which will be designed by those issues that are directly related to the destructive influence of Russian aggression on nature. Ecocide counteraction is one of the points of the Ukrainian peace formula, and we have to implement each of its points, all aspect.

Conversation with Guatemala President. The formula of peace, our collaboration with Latin asimate, help us in demining, it is very important - in the creation of a tribunal of Russian aggression.

Meeting with representatives of our business is very important, very meaningful. I am greeted. They discussed how to stimulate economic activity now, in the face of our conditions. They talked about how to give more business protection, more cooperation and business. Now the first priority is defense, and it is obvious. But icing is also important.And, of course, our warriors, our protection. Today, in the appeal to the community, this is one of the leading world, British intellectual centers - I told that three new new decrees were prepared, very important, and 419 soldiers were awarding our soldiers. In total, more than 49,000 Ukrainian Ukrainians have already been awarded during the full -scale state awards!

I thank everyone and everyone who protects our country!Thank you to everyone who now, who has given us the best news today - about the advancement of Ukrainian positions. Glory to you, our characters!

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-29T30-00-00-04-00/3-nataliya-gumenyuk.jpg)Today, on the national marathon "Unified News", the head of the United Coordination Press Center of Defense forces of Southern Ukraine, captain of the 1st rank Nataliagumeniuk told about the consequences for the enemy's logistics after the "cotton" of the Odgar bridge, which happened on June 22.

Recall that the Chongar bridge that connects the occupied Crimea with Kherson region has suffered significant damage. This slowed down the logistics deliveries of the invaders.

Natalia Humeniuk noted that the pontoon crossing is not a full -fledged replacement of the stationary bridge.

- This is an extreme way to replace the bridge. Given our experience in the Anatonivsky Bridge, the tactics of the occupiers are formaining the tactics of actions of the occupiers. We know what they will do, how they will try to build an alternative. The enemy is also aware of the fact that we will work methodologically by this crossing. It is clear that it complicates their logistics, supply, but the occupiers will continue to repair the bridge, taxam, as they did during our work on the release of the Right Bank by hypersenses across the Dnieper.

The officer noted that the enemy was in very difficult conditions. After all, the events that are now unfolding on the front line occur directly to the dry, and the bridge is located in the deep rear of the invaders themselves.

- They will suffer again and again because it does not work fully. Therefore, the alternative way through Armenian is much closer to the positions of defense forces, and the invaders are aware that fire control is also powerful there. We can say that the damage to the Chongar Bridge is the prerequisite for the creation of quiet news to which we approach.

The head of the united coordination press center of the Defense Forces of the South of Ukraine has said that in the occupied part of Kherson region the enemy tries to maneuver, using even those areas where the water has only left a little. In this way, the conscience is trying to create the same fire they feel from the Zaporozhye direction, an additional tense front in the Dnieper direction.Natalia Humeniuk emphasized that it was necessary to realize that he had a large number of defense border and had time to replace large floors. This significantly constrains the pace of promotion of the Ukrainian army, but does not make them impossible.

- We continue combat work, it is significantly complicated, the enemy tries to resist, but our promotion and effort is absolutely positive. We liberate the generic land.

Every conscious citizen is a detail of the aggressor to repel the aggressor, our internal consolidation in cytgic times is an extremely important factor for victory over the aggressor. However, despite the fact that our society has already gone to "war" for more About the basic responsibilities of each Ukrainian in the current environment. In particular, it is even about such elementary things as the issue of compliance with military accounting rules in the Tax Code and the conscripts, conscripts and reservists.

The Armyinform appealed to the Head of the Public Relations Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Fity to remind the general public about the basic responsibilities of citizens of daily accounting, as well as to answer the most pressing questions, so "bureaucratic". of conscripts and reservists.

*!

- The first document to mention is [Constitution of Ukraine](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80\#Text), where Article 17 states: "Protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, ensuring its economic and information security are the most important functions of the state, the cause of the whole Ukrainian people."

"Three Whales" on which state policy on defense of the country, including reporting, which relates to military accounting, is the laws of Ukraine "[Promobilization preparation of tamobilization](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3543-12\#Text)"," [About Defense of Ukraine](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1932-12\#top)"," [About military duty and military service](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2232-12\#Text)»,

In addition, on December 30, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved [resolution](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1487-2022-%D0%BF\#Text)No. 1487 “On Approval of the Procedure of Organization and Military Accounting of Prisoners, Servicemen and Reservists”, which defines the mechanism of “organization and maintenance of“ military accounting(Further - public authorities), local authorities, military administration bodies(governing bodies), military units(units)Armed Forces and other military formations and law enforcement agencies of special purposes, territorial centers of staffing, enterprises, institutions and organizations, institutions of education, health care institutions regardless of subordination and formality.

So, today the mentioned documents are the alpha and omega of all processes, quality of military accounting of Ukrainian citizens.

*!

- All conscripts, conscripts and reservists must independently update personal data in the CCC and JV, it is extremely important for the maintenance of military accounting, and therefore for the defense capability of our country.

Pursuant to paragraph 23 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine above mentioned above, conscripts, conscripts, and reservists must update the data in the event of changes:

names, name, patronymic;

dates and places of birth;

gender;

place of residence and stay;

information about parents, adoptive parents, guardians, guardians and other representatives(Full Name(in the presence), date of birth;

information about the marital status of the person and his family members(Full Name(in the presence), as well as children;

The details of the passport of the citizen of Ukraine and the passport of the citizen of Ukraine for exit abroad(series, number, date of issuing, issuing body, validity);

Citizenship information;

information on documents confirming the death of a person or recognition of a person or missing;

information on recognition of a person incapacitated or renewal of capacity;

employment information(Enterprise code, place of work, position);

information on the court of criminal case, the sentence that had entered the law;

Availability information(absence)criminal record;

a unique record number in a single state demographic register(in the presence);

Information on the right to defer from conscription for military service during mobilization.

I note that it is necessary to report or transmit new data of the TCC and JV during the days after the change of information.

** - What are the sanctions provided for by the current legislation for violation of the rules of military accounting?

- First of all, I note that the military registration of all conscripts, servicemen and reservists is maintained at their place of residence.

Currently, according to the requirements of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 30.12.2022 No. 1487, every employer must provide personal military accounting of each male worker(except for citizens excluded from a military unit).

Для цього при прийнятті на роботу роботодавець отримує від працівникавідповідний військово-обліковий документ. Завдання роботодавця — перевіритинаявність відмітки про взяття на військовий облік у ТЦК та СП, органах СБУ абопідрозділах Служби зовнішньої розвідки.

Увесь перелік завдань, функцій та діянь, які зобов’язані здійснюватипідприємства, установи та організації всіх форм власності в межахмобілізаційної підготовки та мобілізації, встановлюють вказані вищенормативно-правові акти.

Відповідальність за порушення правил ведення військового обліку визначаєКодекс України про адміністративні правопорушення([KUPAP](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/80731-10\#Text)), in particular, of 210-1 "Violation of Defense Legislation, Mobilization Training Tamobilization" defines the amount of the fine in non-taxable minimum income citizens. Yes it is:

· For individuals(responsible persons for military accounting)- backward to two hundred non -taxable minimum incomes of citizens(1700–3400 UAH);

· For officials(executives)- from two hundred to three hundred non -taxable minimums of income of citizens(3400-5100 UAH).

For neglect of the requirements for military accounting, the fine may impose a duty of the enterprise, and for violation of the order of maintaining military accounting - both the head of the enterprise, and to the person responsible for keeping the military accounting in accordance with the order.

It should be noted that cases of violation of the legislation on mobilization preparation and mobilization and, accordingly, cases of violation of rules of military accounting(as a component of such a violation)Consider the Tax Code and the SP. This order is regulated by Article 235(https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/80732-10\#Text)Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses([KUPAP](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/80731-10\#Text)). Згідно з нею«Територіальні центри комплектування та соціальної підтримки розглядаютьсправи … про порушення призовниками, військовозобов’язаними, резервістамиправил військового обліку, про порушення законодавства про оборону,мобілізаційну підготовку та мобілізацію…»

Також хочу звернути увагу на такий важливий момент: керівники ТЦК та СП маютьправо розглядати справи про адміністративні правопорушення щодо порушенняправил військового обліку і накладати адміністративні стягнення за них.

About it [reports](https://twitter.com/MON_GOV_PL/status/1674092642798272524)The press service of the Ministry of National Defense of Poland.

It is an increase in the number of a military contingent, which constantly reassures on the border, as well as the expansion of different types of fortifications that protect the border.

“We have at least a potentially new situation in Belarus, the presence of Wagner Tamgroup. Based on the data we currently have, we can think that it will be about 8,000 mercenaries. It is a dangerous element for Ukraine, and Ukrainians are aware of it, it is potentially dangerous for Lithuania, and after all, it can be dangerous for us. It can mean a new stage of hybrid war, the stage is much more complicated than the one we still had to do. Therefore, we have made a decision to strengthen our defense on the Eastern border, both in part of some short -term projects and those that will be constantly constant, ” - [said](https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,1590774,grupa-wagnera-na-bialorusi-wicepremier-kaczynski-zostala-podjeta-decyzja-o)Yaroslav Kaczynski.

He also stressed that Poland is ready to reflect the attacks of even such dangerous, well -trained and decisive military group, which at the same time has signs of particularly deep demoralization.

“We strengthen the border of Poland, strengthen security. The border guard is responsible for the border's security, but Polish army is also involved. There will now be greater intensity of these joint measures, ”the Polish National Defense Minister Mariusz Blaschak said, and added that the border in the district Kalinigrad is also strongly protected.

The occupation and risk of committing a terrorist attack in the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant threatens the entire OSCE space.

About it [stated](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/dmytro-kuleba-poperedyv-obsie-pro-ryzyky-vchynennia-rosiieiu-teraktu-na-zaes)Foreign Minister of Ukraine Dmitry Kuleba, speaking online at the OSCE Presidential Conference on Security Reviews.

“Today, Russia is threatening Ukraine and the entire OSCE space of the radiation -mining at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Whatever the Russian propaganda, Russia, and only Russia has today has motivation and means for it to commit an incident to the ZPP, ”he said.

Dmytro Kuleba emphasized that by paying the station and turning it into a militarybaz, Russia uses ZPEs as a nuclear blackmail tool.

"I do not know what else to happen for the OSCE States Parties to recognize the obvious: Russia is not a place at this table," he emphasized.

The Minister recalled that three weeks ago, Russia blew up the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Prospection Dam, causing the largest technological disaster in Europe over the decades of Tazlochin ecocid.

The Minister expressed gratitude to the chairman of Northern Macedonia for the firm position of protecting the principles of the OSCE in the conditions of full -scale aggression of Russia anti -Ukraine.

“Russia cannot tolerate the impunity of Russia, the illegal maintenance of OBSCE employees, theft of more than 70 cars of the organization. There can be no discussion from Ukraine whose president is wanted by the ISS for the military crime of abduction of Ukrainian children. There can be no hope for a civilized dialogue with a country that causes intense rockets and drones on densely populated residential areas, resorts to mass atrocities, torture, rapes and intimidation of the population. There can be no search for an understanding with an aggressor that is declining to destroy Ukrainian statehood and national identity, ”Dmitry Kuleb said.

He also stressed that Ukraine has no choice, except for how to fight for its gravity and restore territorial integrity.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called on the OSCE to actively participate in the embodiment of the formula of peace.

“We live in the time of challenges when discussions without pragmatic decisions are no longer working. If we want to preserve the OSCE and our collective devotion to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, we need to find a way to suspend Russia in the OSCE, ”the minister summed up.

This opinion during the roundtable "The Rebellion of Prigogine and its Impact of the Vallitic situation in Russia and the course of the Russo-Ukrainian War" in MilitaryMedia Center [expressed](https://t.me/militarymediacenter/2386)Alexander Musienko, chairman of the NGO "Center for Military Legal Research".

He recalled that the rebellion unfolded on the background of reports of the successes of the defense forces of the southern and eastern directions.

In addition, in the course of their march on Moscow, "Wagnerivka" destroyed several air vessels of regular troops and killed 15 people and will not bear any responsibility.

“This condition will cause friction among the Russian military. Some will ask: why do Wagnerians can do so, and here they are tilted and make them go to the thighs in the assault? And secondly, there will be a part that will think: can we repeat something too? .. And that means that the moral state of the Russian military will fall, ”the expert said.

Meeting with members of the International Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of the War - Greta Tumbberg, Margot Walstrom and others. They talked primarily about Russian thermal and ecocide at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station and, in general, about the work of our group, which will be designed by those issues that are directly related to the destructive influence of Russian aggression on nature. Ecocide counteraction is one of the points of the Ukrainian peace formula, and we have to implement each of its points, all aspect.

Conversation with Guatemala President. The formula of peace, our collaboration with Latin asimate, help us in demining, it is very important - in the creation of a tribunal of Russian aggression.

Meeting with representatives of our business is very important, very meaningful. I am greeted. They discussed how to stimulate economic activity now, in the face of our conditions. They talked about how to give more business protection, more cooperation and business. Now the first priority is defense, and it is obvious. But icing is also important.And, of course, our warriors, our protection. Today, in the appeal to the community, this is one of the leading world, British intellectual centers - I told that three new new decrees were prepared, very important, and 419 soldiers were awarding our soldiers.

Tonight was recorded a take-off of enemy TU-22M3 from the Aerodrome Schikovka(from the north)and from the southern regions(Mood). Також противник застосував ракетиС-300 у Харківській та Запорізьких областях. Про це заявив речник КомандуванняПовітряних Сил ЗС України полковник Юрій Ігнат в ефірі телевізійного марафону«Єдині новини». Він зазначив, що застосування ракет із бомбардувальників небуло. Інформація щодо наслідків застосування С-300 наразі уточняються.

Юрій Ігнат розповів про те, що повітряна тривога оголошується за відповіднимиалгоритмами згідно із тими загрозами, які існують. Відповідно цевідображається на мапі повітряних тривог. Проте інколи стаються технічні збоїу додатку.

— До прикладу, вчорашній день, коли тривога була оголошена по всій Україні,лише Сумська область не запалилась червоним кольором у додатку. Потрібнорозуміти, що не завжди може спрацювати система, є певні технічні моменти. Томунамагаємось в ТГ-каналі Повітряних Сил повідомляти про ті ризики і загрози,які виникають, по напрямках. Пишемо — загроза застосування балістичногоозброєння на тому чи іншому напрямку, або є загроза застосування керованихавіабомб чи ракет з цього напрямку одразу кільком областям. Тому требареагувати на всі сигнали, які надаються, і йти в укриття.

Окрім того, офіцер зауважив, що російські окупанти продовжують постійно шукатиякомога легших шляхів, щоб менше потрапляти в зону української протиповітряноїоборони, прокладаючи маршрути по різних напрямках, використовуючи рельєфмісцевості, русла річок тощо.

— Ворог застосовує всі методи, вони не нові, використовувались і рік тому підчас повітряних атак з різних напрямків. Так само застосовуються і дрони-камікадзе. Противник намагається обходити потенційні місця перебування нашоїППО, щоб якомога більше ракет та дронів долітало до заздалегідь встановленихцілей.

Також офіцер розповів про радіолокаційні станції, які працюють в комплексісистем ППО, зокрема й отримані від західних партнерів.

About it [reports](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-povidomyla-pro-pidozru-ponad-200m-osobam-yaki-poshyriuvaly-informatsiiu-pro-robotu-ppo-ta-inshykh-syl-oborony)Security Service of Ukraine.

In fact, these individuals helped the enemy to prepare, carry out and adjust air strikes in our territory, in particular with the use of winged Idronov-Kamikadze missiles. The suspicion has been declared for unauthorized dissemination of information on the direction, movement of weapons, Armed Forces of Ukraine or other military forms.

In terms of 190 of these persons, the indictments were sent to court. The intruders have been imprisoned up to 12 years in prison.

According to the investigation, in most cases, citizens purposefully transfer information about the places of base and movement of units of the Armed Forces, the State Border Service and the National Guard.

First of all, the enemy was interested in the coordinates of the points of temporary deployment, routes and fortifications of Ukrainian defenders. Also, the firing positions of Ukrainian artillery and air defense systems were found.

For example, at the end of May this year in Donetsk, the informative management of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation was detained(better known as a game). Фігурантнамагався приховано зафіксувати рух українських військових колон, якіпереправлялись через р. Сіверський Донець у напрямку Бахмута.

Крім того, співробітники Служби безпеки оперативно встановили особи шістьохмешканців столиці, які незаконно поширювали інформацію про роботу сил ППО підчас масованої атаки рф на Київ у ніч на 16 травня.

Чотирьом фігурантам вже повідомлено про підозру у вчиненні злочину. Щодо двохз них — обвинувальні акти скеровано до суду. Стосовно інших — триваєрозслідування.

Служба безпеки вкотре наголошує на забороні знімати та оприлюднювати відео- іфотоматеріали про діяльність Сил оборони і наслідки російських обстрілів. Їхпоширення (conscious or unconscious)It is regarded as an adjustment of enemy fire is a crime punishable in accordance with the law.

Thank you very much!Congratulations to all of you, thank you for the invitation!

This week I started a trip to the front to two of our regions - Donetsk Tazapozhka. The most combat operations are now concentrated there - both sensitive and defense. High intensity of fighting, the highest heroic people!

Our warriors are absolute fellows, and I am proud of them, everyone and everyone who is contagious, who reflects Russian assaults and destroys Russian terrorists. We manage to release our land and people from the occupiers, and this is the most important thing.

The more successful our warriors will now be, the more Russia will cease to be a dangerous for both Ukraine and all of our Europe.

History demonstrates that unsuccessful aggression always makes dictatorships weak. We are now we see in Russia - we see such weakness we need. The weakness of Russia will be safe for others, and its defeat overcomes the problem of this war.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-29T82-00-00-04-00/51630232e98b65cfc1cadfe2681b947d_1688051235-scaled.jpeg)** _ Dear colleagues, partners!_ **

I am grateful to all of you who help our defense against Russian aggression!Thank you every air defense system - they really save lives. It's true. Thank the European initiative for a million shells for Ukraine, for our tanking and for all the defensive packages that were provided to our country. This is all true of historical cooperation to protect Europe.

In particular, Ukraine is grateful to Lithuania and Poland, and we will not allow Russia or its terrorist groups to even try to break the safety and Polish peoples from Belarus. For Ukraine, partners' safety is also safety.

Yesterday, a visit to Ukraine was Mr. President of Lithuania Nausede and Mr President Duda, and we exchanged with them assessments of the situation in the territory of Belarus Tanavana.

Ukraine's position is quite clear: any attempt to blackmail Europe, any passage of a test of something against Europe should be perceived equally to the whole of Europe. If someone will threaten a particular people in Europe somewhere, it is absolutely natural - to join this people and eliminate the threat.

Another thing that is important to say today in a security context is sanctions.It is important not to stop in sanctions. The smaller the pauses, the less Russia will adapt to the pressure on it and come up with less than how to bypass sanctions. Thank you that the111 sanction package pays attention to the efforts of Russia to bypass the sanctions across the country, and this attention should be strengthened in the 12th EU sanction package.

Unfortunately, many rockets that Russian terrorists now use against life in Ukraine have recently been produced and contain critical components that are made by the free world companies. You cannot put up with this. We must combine the use of the free world technologies for the sake of aggression opposite freedom.

It is impossible to endure what Russia does with our Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant. Let me remind you that it is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russian terrorists found it. We have specific information from our intelligence, and we have presented, in particular, diplomats of European countries. As it is, by the way, information of Russia's prosecution for foreign components for missile production. The Russian anatomical industry deserves sanctions in response to Russian radiation blackmail.

Tomorrow is coming to the EU Swedish presidency, and I want to thank Sweden to Mr. Prime Minister Christverson for their effective work. For these six months, it became stronger. I am sure of that.

On behalf of all Ukrainians, I want to thank you, dear leaders, and you, Charles, you, Ursulo, you, Roberto, for making extremely important economic and political decisions that help us protect freedom and Europe.

Unfortunately, there are things that don't help us. But if solidarity is sufficient, if our security and economic cooperation is not broken by artificial illegal restrictions, if the long -term and principled decisions of Europe, Ynadali, will signals the world that Europe believes in peace, then this war will definitely be worried.Finally, a few thoughts about the next six months for Europe. I believe that this Saturday, on the first day of Spain's presidency in the EU, for my request, Ukraine will visit Mr. Prime Minister of Spain Sanchez. It is a lot about how important it is for our Europe.

It is a historical time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Evrop of values, free and strong Europe, Europe of peace is unthinkable without Ukraine. We are ready for membership negotiations, and our progress is necessary to record the European Commission. Ukraine is set up as soon as possible to prepare for the start of merging about membership, and we will do it.

Peace has no alternatives. Therefore, the maximum unity in Europe has no alternatives.

Thank you for your attention!Thank you for the support, friends!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

As of now, the total number of ships is 10 and2 respectively. In the Black Sea for combat duty after a two -day pause removed the water rocket launcher, whose equipment is up to 8 calibers.

- At this point, the situation remains constant. We continue to track it. We see that the enemy activates unmanned reconnaissance along the front line of the front to penetrate deeper into the rear regions. Such actions in some way indicate the probable preparation for the following rocket strokes. Also, during the last two days, the enemy activity was observed, especially at night of confident regions. This means that in a way, the enemy has reformed his zuzzles, apparently, studied the opportunities and seeking tactics that would be bulmedly effective. At the same time, we remember that they very often make up for the lack of effectiveness on the front line with the rear "victories", causing strokes on peaceful objects.

According to the officer, now the enemy tries to increase the pressure on the right bank, firing it as much as possible, and seeks to engage in the accumulation of people. This indicates that their main target is not military objects, but pressure of the population.

- In particular, on the left bank, settlements suffer from enemy shelling, despite the fact that they are just under the occupation of the Russians, so to speak, in their launch. The enemy continues the tactics when he pulls his guns away from the painter, covers him with fire, and then returns and explains that the then made the forces of defense, trying to break forward. Again, it shows how the enemy continues to pass the local population and translate it to their side.

The enemy also exacerbates night shelling. This may indicate that in the daytime occupants are re -equipped with their positions and hidden overbodarial struggle of the Ukrainian units.

Last week, the elaboration between the Wagner Commander Prigazin and the Russian authorities was a topic of discussion in Brussels.

“Recent events in Russia have raised many questions. First of all, it affects the inner dynamics in Russia, the invasion of Ukraine and the European security as a whole. What we can be sure is that Ukraine should remain a prioritomator alone.

According to Roberta Motzolla, Ukraine demonstrates significant progress in the reform states, so we can hope that negotiations on entry into the EU will start at the end of 2023.

“The success of Ukraine in reforms is extraordinary, especially during the war. The requirements of the reform must be fulfilled, and then we answer. I remain optimistic that this(Start of entry negotiations - ed.)Maybe this year can be aware of this year, ”said Robert Motzol.

I finish the day in the Verkhovna Rada - meeting with our speaker Ruslanstefanchuk. We work.

And now the report for this day, a busy day. Very long.

The meeting of the European Council is traditionally for Ukraine to be among the members of the Evrosouz. The agenda is obvious - our defense in this war, our path, the support from our partners, our security support for them, for our Europe. Ukraine influences the power of Europe. This is a fact. And this year, on the basis of this and other similar facts, unity in Europe, including the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union.

Meeting with Mike Penso, 48th Vice President of the United States, Senator ... American support for Ukraine is vital for all Americans, every American family, all US public forces, all political leaders, congress-both parties, of course, from US President Biden. Thank you for your feast!

He discussed our defense with Mr. Penso, our interaction - from the very beginning, pre -days between the Ukrainian and American peoples. They talked about the weapons, the projection of our soldiers, about our common values.

Meeting with members of the International Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of the War - Greta Tumbberg, Margot Walstrom and others. They talked primarily about Russian thermal and ecocide at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station and, in general, about the work of our group, which will be designed by those issues that are directly related to the destructive influence of Russian aggression on nature. The opposition of ecocide is one of the points in the Ukrainian formula of peace, and we have to implement each of it, all aspect.

Conversation with Guatemala President. The formula of peace, our collaboration with Latin ascetic, help us in demining, it is very important - in the creation of a tribunal of Russian aggression.

Meeting with representatives of our business is very important, very meaningful. I am greeted. They discussed how to stimulate economic activity now, in the face of our conditions. They talked about how to give more business protection, more cooperation and business. Now the first priority is defense, and it is obvious. But icon economics is also important.

I am grateful to all who work for the sake of Ukraine, Ukrainians, who keeps and creates jobs, who pays taxes and who are already preparing for our restoration, for a large -scale transformation program of Ukraine, which we will be obliged after our victory.I thank everyone and everyone who protects our country!Thank you to everyone who now, who has given us the best news today - about promoting Ukrainian positions. Glory to you, our characters!
