Defense heads of the Union countries who held a meeting with the NATO format committee today identified the strategic directions for the development of the Alliance and confirmed the adamant support of Ukraine in its struggle for Russian aggression.

As [reports](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3707468-vijskovij-komitet-nato-pidtverdiv-nepohitnu-pidtrimku-ukraini.html)Ukrinform, Admiral Rob Bauer, said the NATO headquarters today at a press conference at the NATO Headquarters.

NATO Military Committee is the highest body of the Alliance's military administration, which determines the needs of defense and development of the Armed Forces to ensure the collective defense of the Allies, to enforce political decisions in the country's leaders.

"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Admiral Bauer said.

"The heads of the South Defense have confirmed their unchanged support-there is no doubt that NATO will support Ukraine for as long as it is a budget," the head of the NATO Military Committee added.

He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.

“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to join, adapt and protect, ”Rob Bauer said.

He recalled that the Armed Forces of the Union countries now unite 3.2 million people in military uniforms, and they all work for the same purpose-reliably protection of a billion citizens living in the Alliance, the tadomocratic values they share. Their commitment and determination are a clear signal to the potential aggressor - NATO will protect every inch.

"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.

“Wages arrears in the Russian“ military-civil administration ”of the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhya region ranges from 1 to 2.5 months. The management of occupation administrations claims that the Moscowas are blocked in the Russian Treasury in connection with bureaucratic conversations. However, according to information from our underground, blocking the funds is at the level of decision in Moscow. The Russians decided not to pay the funds to the "administrations" due to the development of the situation on the front, " - the testing of the Center for National Resistance reads.

From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian invaders have not created a systematic support system, have suffered heavy losses, and now forced to use outdated equipment and uninvited people in large numbers.

As [reports](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3707487-vijna-v-ukraini-dedali-silnise-protistavlatime-kilkist-akosti-admiral-bauer.html)Ukrinform, the day before in Brussels, during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of Defense of the Union countries, said the chairman of the Military Committee Natoadmiral Rob Bauer.

At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.

“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the award miscalculations that Russia was preparing for the three -day, "forgot" to inform the performers about its goals and could not expand the logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said the Dutch Admiral Bauer.

He noted that in the conditions of fighting on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into a logistics competition, and this is what happens in Ukraine now. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.

“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO's Military Committee said.“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be associated with collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Rob Bauer said.

He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.

In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in the Europian American General Christopher Cavola noted that the Russian army should not be underestimated.

“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”said the US military commander.

Since the beginning of May, especially in the days declared by the occupiers of the festive tavhihid, in the temporarily occupied territories in Zaporizhzhya and Kherson region the number of cases of looting and theft of Russian servicemen has increased significantly. The property and vehicles are mainly stolen by a release of the need to ensure evacuation of the population.

About it [wrote](https://t.me/annamaliar/721)Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in Telegrams.

“In the settlements Tokmak, childbirth, Kamianka, Rozivka, Mikhailivka, Molochansk, Energodar, Chernihivka in the temporarily occupied territory of the Uzaporozhye region, Russian invaders, covering up with the so -called provision of mechanical measures, stolen the material values of local enterprises of Tagiv.

According to Anna Malyar, in Energodar at night from the territory of the private enterprise "Electropodenmontazh-10", about 20 units of transportation were stolen and the composition of material property was looted.

Also, at night, under the pretext of evacuation of the Russian occupation administration of the razing point Skadovsk in the temporarily occupied territory in the Kherson region, the invaders hastily removed the looted office equipment and other property.

"It is probably that on May 7 this year, Russian invaders will be used to move the stolen property of the temporarily occupied Crimea," Anna Malyar said.

“I have such a vision and it is processed, and now we have even begun to look at these options, including at the Ioboron National Security Committee.

At this, the commander -in -chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny emphasized the Winterv Special Project Dmitry Komarov "[](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TadXxP_26V8&ab_channel=%D0%A1%D0%92%D0%86%D0%A2%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%92%D0%98%D0%92%D0%9E%D0%A0%D0%86%D0%A2)», Reports Ukrinform.

He expressed the opinion that the strategic goal [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)At the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, it was to destroy Ukrainian. “They hoped that they would come in organized columns, people would meet them with bread and salt, and the Ukrainian state has become. But the Ukrainians began resistance, Ukrainians began to defend themselves. Today, they come here from the Russian Federation to consciously kill Ukrainian. The essence of this war is that if we are not destroying the enemy now, we will be destroyed, because they have come consciously, ” - said Zamaluzhny.

The Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces emphasized that the Russians go to kill Ukrainians, after all, that they carry "crazy" losses on the battlefield in Ukraine. Zaluzhny emphasized that this is their goal.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-12T18-33-18-03-00/630_360_1683905578-605.png)The efforts should be defined as one of the most serious crimes of antivore law and peace.

He stated this in his video address, reports Ukrinform with a reference to [](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/namagannya-obijti-sankciyi-maye-viznachatisya-yak-odin-iz-na-82833).

** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!**

Today we have a sanction day. Five sanction packages were approved, which were carefully prepared in the NSDC, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Office, and our special services.

The first is a package concerning Zaporizhstal. We block the impact on this terrorist company, which existed thanks to various false and offshore persons. The part controlled by Russia through one of the systemic banks will be confirmed and operated for Ukraine and Ukrainians.

We will not leave any connection of the terrorist state in Ukraine, which it can be useful against our country, against our economy or against our people.

In addition, sanctions packages have been approved that continue our course in the insulation and blocking of the Russian military industry.

Hundreds of natural and legal persons of the terrorist state and the target for global isolation. We are very active in working with partners so that everyone who actually produces this aggression, who gives weapons, ammunition, technician technology into the hands of terrorists - that they are all crushed with the world.

I thank everyone who helps Ukraine to press on Russia for this war, as well as to block the efforts of the terrorist state to bypass sanctions. I am sure that it is to be one of the most severe crimes against international law in the international peace - an effort to bypass sanctions imposed to limit the restrictions of aggression, or to promote these efforts.

He held a rate meeting today. There were important reports of commander -in -chief. I will particularly note the report of General Syrsky Tageneral Tageneral - commanders of Khortytsia and Tavriya, respectively. The report of Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Reznikov, Minister of Defense Kamyshin, was a report.

What is important to understand now? The invaders are already internally ready for defeat.

They have already lost this war in their thoughts. We need to press on them daily so that their feelings of defeat turn into their escape, their mistakes, their losses.He spoke with Britain Prime Minister Sunak today. I thank you, Rishi, the support of support and the steps that allow you to understand the world that the kingdom will always be the leader.

We have discussed our current interaction in weapons, our further defensive development, as well as diplomatic steps that we need to take together to bring the more common victory.

To guarantee: who would not be the aggressor against the free world, he finishes the same shame as the Kremlin.

Glory to all our soldiers, who are now in battle, in combat posts and in combat operations!I thank everyone who trains our fighters!I thank everyone who treats Ukrainian soldiers after injuries!

**Glory to Ukraine!**

This opinion was expressed by the correspondent of Ukrinform by the president of the Congress of Ukrainian Channel Alexander Khichiy.

"More than 80 so -called Russian" diplomats "are accredited in Canada, which is much more than our close allies as Germany and the United Kingdom. They are, despite two consecutive reports of the Parliamentary Committee on Question Safety and Intelligence, that they are foreign harmful agents, ”Khichi said.

Her opinion was supported by the Executive Director of the Congress of Ukrainians of Canada Igormikhalchyshyn. “From the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 20122, NATO and EU allies have sent more than 600 diplomats, a rebellious blow to Russian intelligence and destabilization.

It is unclear why our government refuses to take steps for their expels for the sake of protecting Canadians, ”Mikhalchyshyn said.

He stated this in an interview [](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/czech-president-gives-ukraines-offensive-high-chance-success-2023-05-12/), reports Ukrinform.

“Of course, there is a great hope that the Ukrainian counter -offensive will be successful because [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina)Motivated, well -prepared, its experienced and, of course, are not exposed to such deficiency as Russian Army, ”Pavel said.

But, he acknowledged, if Russia is using its prepared defense well, they will be sacrificed.

According to the President, the Russian army had serious problems in the shape and technical support and combat spirit, but the collapse is not worth defense, because

Russia managed to prepare relatively high quality and deep defense in several borders.

The former Commander-in-Chief of the Czech Army, as well as the Chief Military Advisor to the NATO General Secretary in 2015-2018, believes that Ukraine will eventually hold Western fighters, but it will not be possible to transfer them in time for the commercial offensive. Urgent needs are ammunition, he added.

It was not possible to predict what territory Ukraine will be able to take away, because it is the ding scenarios of the offensive, and not always goes according to desires and plans.

The Czech leader noted that Ukraine needs the support of partners to access Donato and the European Union, but expressed the opinion that this process will be difficult and long -lasting in both cases, although negotiations on accession to the EU have all the chances to take a chance this year.

** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3707406-cehia-peredast-ukraini-dvi-sistemi-ppo-kub-iz-raketami.html)Pavel also touched China's question in an interview. He said that the actions of China during the war in Ukraine showed that the PRC was not a constructive player, because he did not invalid the war in Ukraine in Ukraine and did not call for the withdrawal of Russian troops.

The President of the Czech Republic is convinced that the European Union and other democracies need a single and realistic position on this state, one voice, so every other EU countries cannot play on equal to Beijing on their own. Babil, China will use bilateral contacts as a chance of splitting European countries or to tear Europe away from the United States.

Earlier, Paul said that Ukraine has only one chance for a large contrast.

“It is clear that Putin does not intend to give up his goals to conquer Ukraine, he will continue to attack and destroy it. The ministers today have presented the importance of continuing Ukraine's support. This is and remains our retardant - to provide Ukraine with the help and means that it can defend and achieve the necessary stability for the task of defeat Russia, ” - said the Zhezep Borrel.

He recalled that over the past 15 months, the EU has provided a military worker worth about 15 billion euros to Ukraine, and it is already obvious that it will be even more. The EU was quick to provide Ukraine with immediate assistance, and it is time to look in the medium term.

"We need to weigh how to transform tools that have been worked out to respond to immediate threats, such as ammunition and military equipment, and turn them into long -term obligations that will give Ukraine confidence and allow it to provide it with humanitarian, financial assistance." The high representative of the EU noted.He stressed that Ukraine's entry into the European Union is a main commitment on the part of the Member States, the implementation of which should ensure Ukraine stability and prosperity. But before this happens, the EU will require practical and specific assistance to Ukraine.

Behind the scenes ”, as it is on the air of the nationwide TEMACHPON“ Single News ”, answering the questions of what were the first steps on February 24, 2022.

“I will disappoint you if you are waiting for the great pathos. Understand the military, because for us the war went. This day was remembered by literally such two interesting moments: the first moment is that literally, when it all started, I called every commander who was responsible for a particular area. Or I told him what started, and Vinmen - "I understood." Or the commander reported to me that some actions were already working out what he was performing. And I said - hold on, you know what to do.

That's the tactic they use. Worse is that I know that they have the opportunity to do so. We have a little more tactic and a slightly different strategy.

“I will say so, this Soviet [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-armia)She lived for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a long time. And there is an echo somewhere. It was not fully existent. Now, when there are heavy battles, when multi -processes are connected to each other, it is difficult to do, but my subordinates know if I find a representative of the Soviet Army somewhere in any position, I will not understand long, ”Zaluzhny said.

At the same time, he compared the Russian army with the tsarist, where warriors are not very appreciated. "This is the feudal army where such a attitude persists. This is, at least, what we miber in the field of battle, by intercepting, ”he added.

At the same time, answering the question of the presenter, he suggested that the Russians had caused the main mistake - believed that Ukrainians were similar to them.

Thanks to the mine of the Bozena-5 demining in many settlements, Kharkiv region has renewed electricity. It is used precisely on the grounds that are used for immediate demining, for example, areas where there are lines of electric programs. Thus, the combat calculation of this machine has already cleared from the GNP the preducified territories of the communities of Slobozhanshchina 215,639 km of transmission lines.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=573598081528021)Command of Forces of Support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

A representative of the Department of Engineering Forces Department of Supporting Armed Forces of Ukraine spoke about the experience of using the BOZENA-5 mine-5 demining machine, which was used for Ukraine by the Slovak company Way Industry.

- This machine saves the lives of the sappers, they do not go first, but actually pick up. It is effective and fast, and if you speak from the context of mine, it justifies itself, - said the representative of the Command of Support.

Background: The machine is intended for demining potentially contaminated with a hazardous objects. It can be used to cleanse protintanka and anti -personnel mine fields.

Any demining means is a powerful contribution to the process of purifying terminals, because it is remote-rooted, and the speed of passage reaches 9 kilometers per hour. The complex is accompanied by a demining group of 5 people, 2 of them with metal detectors to fully monitor the situation, 2 collect the stakes, and the commander who controls the process.

- It should be understood that no mechanized tool gives a guarantee that there will be no explosive object. That is why any demining is followed by a group of sappers, which chooses these remains from the soil. That is, the main merit of Bozena-5 is that it makes it impossible for the undermining of a proof object, although it leaves the explosives in the soil. It also plays a role in which type of working organ is used: chain or fighter. In the latter, rigid fighting structures that bring mine or any other GNP into action or break up our places, which represent the remains of an explosive substance,-said support representative of support forces.

Problems with these samples of equipment are still insufficient base for post -warranty service.

The robot Smolia is a response to their criminal statements and actions. But despite this, the author is hesitant whether it is advisable to joke during the war.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-12T71-00-00-04-00/oleg_smal_.jpg)- I always call the caricature a "defect in the psyche", because few people dreamed of sore time for the country. Agree that it is not quite normal to accept everything that happens around, with laughter. But, as for me, it is the joke at the most difficult moments to stay in their mind, - the cricarist.

Also, during a creative meeting, the co -author of the project "Art in the Country of War" Pavel Lipa demonstrated [documentary picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpUJEW2acE8)dedicated to the cartoonist Oleg Smol.  ![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-12T71-00-00-04-00/pavlo_lypa.jpg)- The war was able to focus on political satire. He managed to connect Ukrainian cartoonists to confront Russian propaganda. It inspired this to devote one of the series to him. I want to show my own film, what art is capable of in times of war and whether personal creativity can exist in society, which has completely become on military rails, - said Pavel Lipa.

The cycle of documentaries "Art in the Country of War" is a joint pro -DOCNOTEFILMS and Babylon'13 about Ukrainian artists who remained in the country during a large -scale invasion and continue to create.

- Thanks to this assistance, we have three full -blooded crews with this type of fighter arms, - said Yuri Ignat. - Today, all families of tactical aviation - and fighter, and assault and bombard - support both defensive and inusual fighting of our land units. But to gain a prevalence in the air, another type of aircraft is needed - a modern western multifunctional fighter, which we expect to get and re -arry our aviation park. In the meantime, Polish and Slovak migs, of course, help us to resist the enemy and perform combat missions as possible as possible this type of aircraft.

Commenting on the changes in the operational environment, Colonel Yuri Ignat noted that the last day was activated by the enemy exploration UAV along the collision line. The enemy also continues to strike with managed aircraft in frontline areas.

- We see these reconnaissance UAVs. We track. If we find yourself in the area of the defeat of the means of air defense - we will destroy, - the officer assured.

Also, the head of the public relations service for the Command of the Air Force has been forced that the world community needs to constantly strengthen the sanction pressure of the aggressor country in order to make it impossible to produce the means of being able to produce. According to Yuri Ignat, during the fall-winter, the strikes of critical infrastructure of Ukraine, the Muscovites used about 850 winged maritime and air base missiles, significantly reducing their courses. Today, the Russian industry is still producing gangs, but the Kremlin can no longer afford massive missile attacks that have been present last year. The current attacks are ten, twenty rockets. However, such rocket strokes occur periodically, which means that the sanctioning is sufficient and should be strengthened.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

Today we have a sanction day. Five sanction packages were approved, which were carefully prepared in the NSDC, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Office, and our special services.

The first is a package concerning Zaporizhstal. We block the impact on this terrorist company, which existed thanks to various false and offshore persons. The part controlled by Russia through one of the systemic banks will be confirmed and operated for Ukraine and Ukrainians.

We will not leave any connection of the terrorist state in Ukraine, which it can be useful against our country, against our economy or against our people.

In addition, sanctions packages have been approved that continue our course in the insulation and blocking of the Russian military industry.

Hundreds of natural and legal persons of the terrorist state and the target for global isolation. We are very active in working with partners so that everyone who actually produces this aggression, who gives weapons, ammunition, technician technology into the hands of terrorists - that they are all crushed with the world.

I thank everyone who helps Ukraine to press on Russia for this war, as well as to block the efforts of the terrorist state to bypass sanctions. I am sure that it is to be one of the most serious crimes against international law in the international peace - an attempt to bypass sanctions imposed to limit the resources of aggression, or to assist in these efforts.

He held a rate meeting today. There were important reports of commander -in -chief. I will particularly note the report of General Syrsky Tageneral Tageneral - commanders of Khortytsia and Tavriya, respectively. The report of Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Reznikov, Minister of Defense of Reznikov, Minister of Defense Kamyshin.

What is important to understand now? The invaders are already internally ready for defeat.

They have already lost this war in their thoughts. We need to press on them daily so that their feelings of defeat turn into their escape, their mistakes, their losses.

I thank everyone and everyone who destroys the enemy!Thank you to everyone who, despite any way, returns our land to Ukraine!We are preparing to add to you, warriors, even more arms, even more opportunities to overcome the aggressor and restore peace.

He spoke with Britain Prime Minister Sunak today. I thank you, Rishi, the support of support and the steps that allow you to understand the world that the kingdom will always be the leader.To guarantee: who would not be the aggressor against the free world, he finishes the same shame as the Kremlin.

Glory to all our soldiers, who are now in battle, in combat posts and in combat operations!I thank everyone who trains our fighters!I thank everyone who treats Ukrainian soldiers after injuries!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

"There is no responsibility for making Russia about its neighbors. So, in a short perspective, we must create an international tribunal against Russia. It should not be forgotten that there is also a crime of the Russian leadership. In fact, it is very important to deal with the crime of aggression.

For small states, such as the Baltic countries, the war is always destruction, and for imperials it is a glory.

For a while, I studied the history of tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo. Only during the Sevnurnberg did the Germans find out about the crimes of the Nazis. Therefore, not only responsibility is important, but also to the future, ”Kai Callas noted.

Lennart Mary Conference has been held annually in Estonia since 2007. Its organizer is the International Defense and Security Center(ICDS). Подія названа начесть міністра закордонних справ (1990–1992)and President of Estonia(1992–2001).

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-12T98-00-00-04-00/52892664653_7c3fd627e1_k.jpg)This was stated by the Director of the International Defense and Security Center Indrek Kannik during the opening word at the opening of the 16th Lennart Mary Conference, the Army of Tallinn reports.

Indrek Kannik compared Ukraine a year ago and now, noting about the strategic outrage of Russians to destroy Ukrainian statehood.

“When we met a year ago at the 15th Lennart Mary Conference, large-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine was still quite early. Mennis three months from its beginning. But even then, there were already signs that the Russian reached its main purpose - the destruction of Ukrainian statehood. The situation was quite unstable. Although Ukrainians were able to repel Russia's attack from the same time, it was possible that Russia would regroup and return.

A year later, Ukraine liberated territories on the western bank of the Dnieper and most Kharkiv region. I am optimistic enough that Ukraine will free up more this summer. The situation is much better than it was a year ago. But it's not where we would like to be, ”said Indrek Kannik.

The slogan of the conference was the quote of the Italian writer Dante Alighieri "Incipitvita Nova"(So the new life begins). В цьому аспекті на думкуІндрека Канніка, варто покарати росію через загарбницьку війну, щоб більше небуло воєн у Європі.

«Ми маємо зробити все, щоб зробити нове життя кращим, ніж нинішнє. Ми нехочемо війни на нашому континенті. Попереднє життя призвело нас до війни.

росія зараз, мабуть, найбільш слабка за останні 20 років. Давайте будьмочесними – ми маємо взяти перевагу в цій ситуації. росія розпочала загарбницькувійну. Вона вбила невинних людей, зруйнувала міста та села, знищилаінфраструктуру та пам’ятки культури.

Нам не потрібно принижувати росію. Але ми маємо покарати її за те, що вонавчинила – як карають злочинців. Кримінальні режими теж. Найкращим покараннямбуде швидка та чітка поразка росії та звільнення всіх українських територій.Цей результат так само в наших руках, як і в руках України», - відзначивІндрек Каннік.

За його словами, нині головним завданням є надання всебічної підтримки Українізадля якнайшвидшої перемоги. Адже російсько-українська війна впливає не лишена Європу, але й решту світу.

«З нашою допомогою, з нашою зброєю, Україна зможе виграти в цій війні. Післявійни, безпека України та наша безпека має бути гарантована українськимчленством у ЄС і НАТО, разом з іншими націями, які цього прагнуть.

We will remind, on May 12 in the capital of Estonia, Tallinna began its work 16-conference Lennart Mary-an annual event, where they discuss issues of international security. The correspondent of the Armyinforms exclusively reports the main discussions that are happening there. The Lennart Mary Conference is the International Defense and Security Center and the European Foundation for Lennart Mary.

This was announced on the national telephone by the adviser to the head of the office of the office of the president Mikhail Podolyak, reports Ukrinform with reference to [](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-podoliak-kyiv-predstavnyk-kytaiu-kompromisy-za-rahunok-terytorii/32409456.html).

“There is a formula proposed by China 12 steps. There are enough correct positions. For example: sovereignty and territorial integrity are the basis for any settlement. Right. And then the first point of our formula of peace proposed by President Zelensky is clearly recorded:(Russian - ed.)They went beyond the borders of the 91st year - and then the concept of sovereignty, non -interference in Ukraine's foreign and domestic policy on the Russian Federation returned. Second: then the territorial integrity of Ukraine comes into force, ”Podolyak said.

According to the adviser to the chairman of the OP, any country can join the discussion, but Kiev will insist on fixing the Ukrainian formula of peace as a man.

Podolyak expressed the opinion that ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj)** It is currently a slightly different position than during the previous year: if there was a "pro -Russian neutrality" earlier, it "demonstrates the absence of a lot to Russia."

“They speak rhetorical words to support a strategic partnership with the Russian Federation, but we see a more active political position in the global sense. And it was a bubazano to explain(China - ed.)Once again: everything can be, all positions can be interrupted with regard to nuclear, food security, but we come out of the key - territory. No compromise at the expense of territories, ”the adviser to the Goloop emphasized.
