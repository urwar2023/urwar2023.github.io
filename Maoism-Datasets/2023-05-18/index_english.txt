In addition, the UN Deputy Secretary General noted that in the first quarter of this year, almost 3.6 million people received humanitarian aid in Ukraine. It is, in particular, about cash payments, food, medical services.

 China thinks that Ukraine should not be a border in the great power of Europe, and a long peace on the continent can only be built through dialogue between European states and respect for each other's interests.
This was stated during a briefing by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Department of China Van Wenbin, reports Ukrinform's own correspondent.
“Position Concerning the Ukrainian issue is consistent and clear. Ukraine should not be a border in a large powerful response, ”Van said, commenting on the words of the former Secretary of State Sshenri Kissinger in an interview with Economist that Ukraine should acquire membership of VNATO and it will meet the interests of both Kyiv and Moscow.

“The grain agreement is unlocked, it will continue its validity until July 18. It will be a lot of receiving Ukrainian products thanks to the efforts of our partners, Turkey and the UN. We are grateful to partners for the adamant and purposeful suggestion that the agreement should work in the future and on the conditions signed by all. I note that the grain initiative was and is valid, as it prolonged March for 120 days, until July 18, ”Alexander Kubrakov emphasized.
To date, 30.4 million tonag products have already been sent to the needs of the world. Since mid -April, Russia has groundlessly launched the work of initiative, and in May, in fact, blocked it by refusing to register a fleet and conducting inspections of the fleet, which is going to load D -Ukrainian ports. Almost 70 vessels are now expected in territorial waters, 90% are those who are ready to deliver our farmers' products to the world.
“We welcome the continuation of the initiative, but we emphasize that it should work effectively. To do this, it is necessary to eliminate problems that are already created by Russia by sabotage of inspections and registration of a new Flot. We hope that our partners will make every effort to make the grain agreement fully work on the food security of the world, and Russia will eventually use food as weapons and blackmail, ”the testimony reads.

"This is the soul of the Ukrainian people ...". He called the Ukrainian embroidery Tarashevchenko, who, while living in a foreign land, always dressed it for big holidays.
Ukrainian embroidery is of extremely ancient origin. Research historians are thinking that it has begun to create folk craftsmen before the age. What it was then - it is unknown, since no model lived on the day.
Historians-researchers are inclined to think that it was created by folk-miles before the VI century
Instead, it is known that only women were embroidered with national clothing, giving the works of positive energy: Ukrainian embroidery symbolized the good, loyalty, love and other virtues inherent in our ancestors. We also know that the craft on the manufacture of mother's embroidery was passed on to her daughters. And those are descendants.
Reference. Some historical sources say that, in addition to drawing, the magic pattern was also applied to the Cossack body in the form of a rush. Here is what Mikhail Chugenko writes in the book "Shocking Ukraine": _ "Warriors ... Before the belt, or in wolf or bear skins, which better than other armor, protected from a blow to a spear or sword. Their body berrkers covered with black or red tattoos that had a magical property. ”_
To say that those who dressed the embroidery were always persecuted, it would not be completely believed. But the attitude towards such people has always different. For example, during the Russian Tsarism, some representatives of intelligence openly wore embroidery, once again confirming their nationality. But not everyone could do so. In addition, Lysenko, who worked in the theater, could not afford something. The writer Lyudmila Starytska-Chernyakhivska mentioned that "because of the Ukrainian language and embroidered shirts, other noble children looked at her and Naii family as abnormal."
During the time of Russian tsarism, some representatives of intelligence openly worn, once again confirming their nationality
The first to combine Ukrainian embroidery with everyday clothes was Ivan Franko, combining an embroidered shirt with a jacket. They look at us and from the 20th hryvnia bill. In Soviet times, no one expressed their negative attitude to embroidery. Although all sorts happened ...
The first to combine Ukrainian embroidery with everyday clothes was Ivan FrancoToday, embroidery is increasingly gaining a place under the sun. Already, no one is from those who wear it, and the Muscovites consider it a Nazi uniform, but who wears the embroidery, equate with the punishments with the SS. I will add: God forbid, we more of such "Nazis", "punishments" ...

 The Foreign Ministry of Ukraine calls on international partners, such as participants in the International Crimean Platform, to condemn today's crime crimes to the Department of the Crimean Tatar people and to recognize their deportation in 1944 by Genocide.
About this it is referred In the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on the occasion of the 79th anniversary of the Crimean Tatars and honoring the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar.
"They are convinced that only the victory of Ukraine and the liberation of the Crimean peninsula may put an end to systemic repression against the indigenous Crimean Tatar and restore respect for human rights in the world," the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.
On May 18, 2023, the age of 79 has been granted for the forced deportation of Crimean Tatars - one of the most horrific crimes of the Soviet totalitarian regime.
In 1944, the USSR accused the Crimean Tatar people in cooperation with the Nazi authorities, which became a far -fetched reason to launch deportation. In violation of the rules of international law, the Soviet governmental act of genocide to erase the national identity of the Crimean Tatar - the indigenous people of Ukraine, prohibiting the use of the mother tongue, professing their religion and preserving their own culture.
"We remember those who have suffered from this tragedy, and we give the truthful Tatar people who have undergone and continue to reinforce repression by the Russian Empire, the USSR, and now in modern Russia," Ukraine has declared in the foreign policy department of Ukraine.

 This reasoning was expressed by the Doctor of Philosophy, the Leading Scientific Trade of NGO "Spirit and Letter" Alexei Panich during the work of the round table "Rashism. Understand to overcome. ”
Answering the question of whether the defeat of the Russian Federation will be entrusted to the collapse of Rashism as an aggressive ideology, regime and political practice, the expert noted that Russia's peace is impossible without the deconstruction of the Imperian state. In his opinion, the decentralization of the aggressor state must be controlled and transformed into a confederation with a frequent loss of individual regions, especially the Caucasus.
 The scientist insists that it is impossible to leave Russia centralized, there is no way to allow it to be a chaotic disintegration, to which the aggressor state is now shaking.
This thesis should be promoted as much as possible among Western politicians of and intellectuals, most of whom now hopes for the possibility of liberal-democratic reforms in the Russian Federation after defeat in the war of anti-Ukraine. In fact, Russia is unable to turn into a liberal deconstruction of the imperial state.

 Until the Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine occupied in Europe in the number of museums one of the leading places. Over the past 14 months, many of them have been irreparable. And many of those who were in the territory that looked at the dirty boot of the Russian soldier or is still temporary, partially, or even fully destroyed, or Barbarian robbed today.
For example, in the Kyiv region, in Mariupol, Zaporozhye and other Ukrainian cities, unless they were destroyed when "liberation" of these settlements, they were toponed.
During the Second World War, the Nazis were known to be "indifferent to all the beautiful, reflected in the museums", as chef Ssenrich Himmler said. Therefore, in the occupied territories, they destroyed museums, more valuable exhibits. Today, they do the racists, having sniffed from the museumchherson, Mariupol, Melitopol, Kakhovka many exhibits. They will soon appear - if you do not appear - in the museums of Perm, Vologda, Cheboksar. And perhaps in the Hermitage, which is so stuffed with exhibits that have nothing to do with Russia.
I do not thicken the paint: the paintings stolen from the Kherson Art Museum, nowadays in the Tavrida Museum in Simferopol. This is, in particular, the picture of Ivanapokhitonov "Picket on the river bank. Sunset ”, written in 1890 with oil. The second canvas is Pavel Sokolov's "House at sunset", owned by the Museum Assembly of the Museum Assembly, too. According to the adviser of the mayor Mariupolyapetra Andryushchenko, the Russian military removed all valuable exhibits from the Museum of Studies and the Art Museum. Quinji, in Mariupol. In particular, the originals of Archip Quinji and Ivan Aivazovsky's paintings.
 
Any conscious Vinnytsia or Vinnytsia will twist the temple fingerbread after heard. And this is at least. Well, at the maximum, Masha will indicate the course "Following the Russian ship". After all, the museum she remembers is a long -standing state of national, it is in excellent condition, as it was, the street, which has Pirogov. Like the Medical University: no one has renamed them and is impossible to rename them. But he sits in Katsapetovka some katsapchuk and, hearing from the hangover, will also assume that we have the Nazis.
But how else, if the disadvantageous professional academicians believe in these "revelations"? At least so they say from TV screens. In general, Zakharova believes that in the world "demons Russia, they conduct" violent Ukrainianization, support culture of all Russian. " The fact is that a few months ago, the experts of the Oonpoli reported that Russia continues to "blamed the history of Tasamobvity of the Ukrainian people to justify the war and hatred." It appears that among the important cultural sites of Ukraine, which affected the shelling, are museums, libraries and churches. I would like to remind that the representatives of this war registered about 250 cultural sites of Ukraine during the year of this war, which were injured or destroyed by war, resolved. Among them are dozens of museums.
If someone has a question, what kind of devil Masha so brazenly lies about the museum of Pirogov, I answer: and about something else, talking about Ukraine, is she what, the truth says? But there are other answer options. With this delusion, she wants to somehow send Russian power, which neglected hundreds of Russian museums. First of all, which, in decent slang, is in the so-called depth. And if in other words, then in a shaken Tmutarakan, like Muscovites themselves, living in Moscow or St. Petersburg, call their surroundings.
The Russians who were expelled from the occupied cities and villages continue to be broken. Among the objects "successfully destroyed by high -precision strokes" are the imums. Yes, the racists recently struck the Kupyansk museum that Nakarkiv region. The museum employees were killed - 54 and 57 years old. Their tillarymen got out of the rubble for several hours ...

 Today, 79 years old since the forced deportation of the Crimean Tatars, one of the most horrific crimes of the Soviet totalitarian regime, has been. The male day, by order of Dictator Joseph Stalin, about 200,000 Crimean Tatars were deported in railway carriages for thousands of kilometers from alien to East Asia. This was the culmination of ethnic purges and the persecution of the Crimean people by Soviet invaders.
It is symbolic that today's memory of the victims of the Genocukrim Tatar people "Remember the history - we return the territory" organized by the office of the Ombudsman of Ukraine, the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people, the public organization of the Crimean Rights and the ZMINA Human Rights Center.
The greatest war crime of genocide that took place in the history of the USSR 
Dmitry Lubinets, the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, told about why they chose exactly the place for the event and how much it is elaboular to the Crimean Tatars.
 - Every year on May 18, the world celebrates the Victims of the Genocchukrim Tatar people. When preparing this event, we very long learned which object to choose for it. Frankly, it was not easy to hold an event on the station - it was not easy, because it is clear that for the Crimean Tatars the station, the railway is a tragic story. Alevese, however, we come from the fact that the most tragic pages of our history we have to forget. We need to remember them, so today we are here to understand how difficult it was for those people who were thrown out of their own wards, loaded simply as a cattle, in railway cars and sent an incomprehensible direction, and no one understood what was waiting there. In fact, the Tseni's greater war crime of genocide, which took place in the history of the Soviet Union, unfortunately, did not give any punishment for it, - Dmitry Lubinets said.
The First Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine Emine Dzhaparova told vivid memories of his life, who concerned childhood on the occupied half and, in her opinion, could serve a mouthpiece for the current "Crimean lesson".
 
She also remembered how all her large family gathered together every year, together people from different corners of Crimea in the central square to pray that the occupying power of the peninsula was now forbidden.
 By the way, during the event, a joint prayer of all present in the Crimean Tatar language took place.  Within the event, the Tashke-Tashkasai Artperfomans also took place. During which the attendees heard an excerpt from a diary of a 13-year-old teenager Narimanakazenbash, who in 1944 was deported by the Crimea together with other Crimean Tatars.
“We are simply obliged to deduct Ukrainian Crimea” 
Another guest of the event was the Viceremier-Minister-Minister of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk, who resolved about the role and importance of indigenous peoples in the reconstruction and de-occupation of Krym.
 - We are simply obliged to deduct Ukrainian Crimea and restore the Ukrainian statehood. We multiply the experience that everyone who has come to and has resisted in the totalitarian system for many years, the regeneration of the younger generation. We need to consider the restoration of Crimea in the context of which the indigenous residents see it. This is the combination of our Ukrainian state and tradition of understanding the spirit and earth, the feeling that the peninsula is needed more and more, the indigenous people are needed. It is this combination of the larger that will not allow us to mock us, to do genocide and to think that it will all go with impunity. We will definitely restore our Ukrainian Crimea, - said Irina Vereshchuk.

Start Crimea Recovery Required from Youth 
 - Today I was asked what I see Crimea? First of all, I see a flowering, independent and under the Ukrainian flag. I think that it is necessary to start the construction of Crimea with young people. That is, from quality education and qualitative leisure for them. Also, we should not forget that most of them lived their whole life under the invading Russian flag, - Rose Bekirov said.
By the way, her great-grandfather was deported from Crimea in 1944. And for three generations, the actual deportation is again.

 Ladies and Gentlemen! 
At any moment, the recording of this appeal can be interrupted by a siren of air anxiety. It is one sentence briefly and accurately describes the state of global security and the level of threats that it faces today.
I congratulate all the participants of the second Strategic Ark and an important dialogue about salary. The decisive battle for his future lasts 449 days. Today is special. This forum takes place on a sign date - May 18. The day in which the history left us many tips and lessons. Casting and errors that we have the right to repeat on the way to our global security.
It was May 18, 1792, when the hundred thousand army crossed the borders of the Commonwealth and invaded its land. The Russo-Polish War began, the consequences of which we all remember.
Today is the same enemy. The same goal. The same price of defeat. We do not have to lose. We do not have the right to weaken the resistance for a moment, to oppose, we have the right not to squeeze evil, to lose the unity of the allies, prematurely lay down, not fight for the final victory.
We do not have the right to mislead when Russia begins to speak actively, talk about diplomacy. Russia is not concerned about the end of bloodshed, the nitrogen of money, resources to continue it.
Russia is needed not peace, but time. For new rockets, a new plan, a new attack. It is a Russian policy. Unchanged for centuries. XXI should be for her last. The mechanisms for the implementation of this contain the Ukrainian formula of peace. Security guarantees, so that this is never repeated.
Not repeated on May 18, 1944. Genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. Primus deportation and loss of their home for decades. All that modern Russia, calling herself the successors and followers of the totalitarian regime, repeated in Crimea in 2014. And repeated eight years in Donbass, Umariupol, Kherson.
Uncomfortable evil is always returning. Without the international tribunal, bringing the reference of all Russian military criminals to return.
We have often heard the words "destruction of international security architecture". On February 24, they were embodied in clear visual forms. The destroyed houses in Bucha, Borodyanka, Uman, Gostomel, Mariupol - this is how security architecture looks today.For our ancestors, falcon is a blessed sky synthesis of reason, courage, youth and strength. Light. Victory. The song "Hey, the Falcons" of the Hundred Little Battle of Ukrainians and Poles into a common battle ** for ours and your freedom.
Today, our benches are much larger. And just like a hundred years ago, we will again seek the parade on Khreshchatyk. For ours and your victory!Ukraine. Europe. World.
Finally, I want to remember one more May 18. Last year. The day that Natootod the application for the entry of two new members. The speed at which Finland passed and the high prospects of Sweden give Ukraine confidence and Viruu Vilnius NATO summit. In the determination of the Alliance and the will to confirm your choice of the value of the values of freedom and the indivisibility of security. The fact that in July we will be honored with a new important stage on the path of Ukraine to NATO membership. In the way of the period and safe future. Ukraine. Europe. The world. Humanity.

 For a long time the information agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has been issuing an information digest. The journalists of the Armyinform were interested in the impressions of the famous printed edition in the army of Sumy region.
 -I really liked the social and legal issues that are considered by the expenses and issues related to certain life situations. I like that here is perfect and quite step by step. I learned many useful things for myself, - said the serviceman Maxim.
 - It is quite convenient that the edition is in A5 format, can always be at hand. The first pages are attracted, in particular, the passage of the VLK, the main tades of financial support of servicemen. Also, I follow the Stoperative and Current Information on the website of the Armyinform and even the material for classes from one of their articles. These are quite interesting materials, I wanted this digest to be larger in volume and directly with questions about changes in the legislation. Perhaps it would be better to make crossword puzzles, anecdotes, etc. You still want more such a publication in order to distribute it to civilian organizations and institutions, - Anna says a military serviceman.
 - Briefly, clearly and creatively revealed issues of mobilization, conscription and other topical issues of military service. Color style is also very beautiful, infographic is good. I would like to add consideration of problematic issues, what worries our military the most, and step -by -step instructions for their implementation, - said the serviceman Elena.
 - It seems such a small book. There is a lot here. In my opinion, we must forget about our veterans and this issue is quite urgent to consider. The section "Business for Veterans" is quite relevant to the present. Legal assistance for our military is very important to consider it with specific examples that have already taken place. The names on the prophecies of Taras Shevchenko were very much liked, - said military personnel.
