<p>This was stated in the evening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUeGaMJwxE"></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRXzWdBohrA"></a>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>_Viso: _ <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9526"><em>opice president, telegram</em></a><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>He just held a military office. This is our special format of work of the Uzuzi circle with those responsible for the defense of the state.</p>
<p>There were commanders of key areas of the front. Also the head, the General Staff, intelligence, safety. Very meaningful work.</p>
<p>The first is that the brigades of defense - young men, the main strategic tasks have been completed, the details are not now reported.</p>
<p>Second: the brigades of the offensive - young people, we are preparing, without details.</p>
<p>Third: in the protection of civilians - air forces - young people, here with insulation. Our priorities this week, next and in the near future - additional air defense systems, additional missiles, training and planes, long -range weapons. And it will be.</p>
<p>He also held a thorough meeting with our international teams today. Ezoma - to retain the dynamics of international support and communication for the adviser, which was achieved in the first half of May, as well as these weeks. I am sure: we will fulfill this task.</p>
<p>He was honored to visit the Crimean Platform Office and meet with the leader -Crimean Tatar people Mustafa Dzhemilev, representatives of the Majlis of the Ikrman Tatar community.</p>
<p>Today and every year on this day, May 18, we honor the memory of all the victims of the Crimean Tatar people. It was one of the most serious crimes of the twenty century - the whole people were taken away from their native land and forced to live in alien. And when people returned home, Russia has once again brought the home, to our Ukraine evil - evil of aggression, repression, humiliation.</p>
<p>Returning justice for all our people, guarantee freedom for the whole state without any exception is our historical task. The task of all who protects the state, all who chose Ukraine and therefore will win.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that the Crimean platform created by us effectively directs the commonality of our country and the Crimean Tatar people. I am glad to know that the masked work with the Majlis brings the desired result.And one more.</p>
<p>Today, many Ukrainians and Ukrainian women have been in embroidery. It is important to remember what wealth unites us all. Ukraine is diverse, and that is our power, it was visible throughout the day in different embroidery ornaments.</p>
<p>But now I ask you all to remember those Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are literally our strength with you, our protection with you. Many of our people were not overwhelmed, because they were in military uniform. I ask you now to remember everyone who <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu"></a>for the sake of Ukraine. All those who assign tasks and at combat posts for the sake of Ukraine. Anyone who trains our bullies for the sake of Ukraine. Those you know personally are those you have heard of, and thousands of others, who all equally save the life of Ukraine. Remember the prony now, please and thank them.</p>
<p>Also, we do not forget about those people whom the invader holds. About prisoners of Ukrainians, about those who are in occupied cities and communities and are waiting for a return flag, our country. We must release all our people and all the land from Russian captivity.</p>
<p>We act together, in unity, taking care of each other and about the state, and we do not stop at the victory.</p>
<p>Thank you all who help!</p>
<p>Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all the victims of Russian tyranny!</p>
<p>Eternal memory of all victims of deportation of the Crimean Tatar people!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em> </strong></p>

<p>The Alliance head also repeated that there is no doubt that Ukraine should become a member of NATO, and the organization should guarantee that Russia will be more than not on a sovereign independent Ukraine.</p>

However, Israel has expressed an entity in the conclusion of such an agreement with the United States.</p>
<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-said-to-propose-joint-military-planning-with-israel-on-iran-but-jerusalem-wary/"></a>.</p>
<p>"The day before, Baiden's administration appealed to Israeli officials with a default proposal that will significantly improve the US -Israeli -military cooperation," the message reads.</p>
<p>The American official stressed that this proposal "does not concern the planning of the US-Israeli strike on the nuclear program of Iran", and will be mainly focused on discussing the ways of anti-registration of Iran's anti-regional activities and unpredictable circumstances.</p>
<p>According to the report, such a proposal arose during a recent visit to the Donizrael of the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff General Milly, Defense Minister Lloyd Austin and US CCS Commander General Eric Kurilla.</p>
<p>However, it is noted that Israel reacted to the proposal carefully and ask him more details.</p>
<p>Israeli officials are concerned that the US proposal may be an attempt to "tie Israel's hands" and possibly complicate any plans for Jerusalem to use Iran, in particular, against his nuclear activity.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-izrail"></a>He asked for clarification as to whether this proposal would be in the field of intelligence and scenarios, whether he would spread to spheres, " - said one of the Israeli officials.</p>

<p>He said this during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"In fact, the promotion of the topic that it is pro -Western and democratic, which is pro -Russian as liberal, and this conservative is very conditional and is done under the pathologra -traditional Western democracy, which does not take into account the Eastern features," the Ukrainian diplomat said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-18T16-17-52-03-00/1684411042-236.jpg" />In particular, he said, the party of justice and progress, headed by the interpreted president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has a right -hand bias with the Islamic platform, but over the last 20 years it has changed quite much.</p>
<p>“In the 2010s, they have made a lot to achieve progress in the EU dialogue and parties in time were very progressive, liberal democrats that made serious reforms. Then gradually this discourse of the party came down to more of such a nationalist dimension, ”Bodnar explained.</p>

<p>“To talk about that one(policies in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tureccina"></a>- order.)The pro -Western, other listeners are not true. I will remind you that the republican People's Party, which is now in opposition to Erdogan, has been in power for a long time. There were periods when there was a one -party government. They pursued a policy of exclusive orientation to Turkish interest. There was no impact of the event, nor the East, ”the ambassador emphasized.</p>
<p>In his opinion, it is now about confronting the Turkish opposition with Erdogan to change power, and the conservative-nationalist forces are concentrated by the more eenaurus preservation of the government coalition format.</p>
<p>As it was reported, the second round of election of Turkish President will take place on the 28th.</p>

<p>This was stated by the European Commissioner for Economics Paolo Gentiloni, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2762"></a>The forecast overview of the development of the European economy, which first includes the indicators of new candidates for membership in the EU - Ukraine, Moldova and Bosnia Igerzegovina, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, the Russian aggressive war against Ukraine throws a long shadowiness to our whole economy. It is not only a human and geopolitical problem, it is also a great economic risk ... But we must be proud that European economic economics demonstrates such outstanding stability ... Management during energy crisis, Fiscal policy coordination - all this led to the script that appeared to be better than expectations, "Gentiloni said.</p>
<p>In particular, according to him, in May, the gas price reached 35 euros in the ground, which is the lowest since the summer of 2021, and according to the forecast, gas prices will be reduced in 2023-2024.</p>

<p>“This section is based mainly on pre -war indicators, which makes enormous uncertainty. At the same time, the country demonstrated prominent resistance during the war and in the efforts to join the EU after, which kept the status of a candidate country on June 23, 2023. This should improve the spectivity for Ukraine, ”the document reads.“The economy has proved stability despite the war. The movement of the population, the reduction of business activity and severe economic losses in the regions of active combat have in fact caused high inflation and the rise in unemployment. In 2022, private consumption and investment fell by 30% and 35 percent, respectively, it caused a 29.1% reduction of GDP. In addition, Russian attacks on the energy grid at the end of 2022 - at the beginning of 2023 destroyed or seriously damaged the power of energy infrastructure. At the same time, the expected energy infrastructure, as well as the initiatives of solidarity and financial assistance, will, according to the forecast, will contribute to the stabilization of economic indicators in 2023, ”the EC said.</p>

<p>“Position <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj"></a>Concerning the Ukrainian issue is consistent and clear.

<p>The diplomat added that in the present circumstances, "all parties should remain calm, show restraint and avoid any action that can strengthen the crisis."</p>

<p>“When Russia attempted annexation of Crimea in 2014, the world was the only speech but not in actions. This prompted Russia to continue aggression and expand its Donbas, and later to the entire territory of Ukraine during full -scale intensification. From last year, we, fortunately, have the unity of countries in the world in support of Ukraine. We all put off problems aside and united around a common goal, counteracting a common enemy, ”the Foreign Ministry said.</p>
<p>He recalled that a year ago, during the EU discussion on granting Ukraine the status of a European Union status in the European Union, some skeptics called Kiev not undercarriage, insisting on a decision that had no consensus. Finally, it was achieved and after the decision of the EU country celebrated unity. Kuleba has compared this dynamics with the current discussion of Ukraine in NATO, which, in his opinion, will also end with a positive resort.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized the unity of views of Ukraine and Poland and noted that two -country work together to achieve the unity of an international coalition with a number of specific decisions. According to the minister, unity cannot be considered out of specific steps. Different decisions require different circles of countries to conquer consensus, and Ukrainian diplomacy is working on its construction in a particular case.</p>
<p>“Nowadays, the widest unity of countries is needed around the position that Ukraine has to prevents in this war under the conditions defined by Ukraine itself. Countries that are in their own purpose are beginning to make the right decisions very quickly.

Russia, as you know, continues to override <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-krimski-tatari"></a>In the occupied Krym, throws them in prison, uses torture, kills them.

<p>Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Alexander Kubrakov spoke about the continuation of the Geruric Agreement.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/oleksandr-kubrakov-zernovu-uhodu-rozblokovano">reports</a>Government portal.</p>
<p>“The grain agreement is unlocked, it will continue its validity until July 18. It will be a lot of receiving Ukrainian products thanks to the efforts of our partners, Turkey and the UN. We are grateful to partners for the adamant and purposeful suggestion that the agreement should work in the future and on the conditions signed by all. I note that the grain initiative was and is valid, as it prolonged March for 120 days, until July 18, ”Alexander Kubrakov emphasized.</p>
<p>To date, 30.4 million tonag products have already been sent to the needs of the world. Since mid -April, Russia has groundlessly launched the work of initiative, and in May, in fact, blocked it by refusing to register a fleet and conducting inspections of the fleet, which is going to load D -Ukrainian ports. Almost 70 vessels are now expected in territorial waters, 90% are those who are ready to deliver our farmers' products to the world.</p>
<p>“We welcome the continuation of the initiative, but we emphasize that it should work effectively. To do this, it is necessary to eliminate problems that are already created by Russia by sabotage of inspections and registration of a new Flot. We hope that our partners will make every effort to make the grain agreement fully work on the food security of the world, and Russia will eventually use food as weapons and blackmail, ”the testimony reads.</p>

<p>"This is the soul of the Ukrainian people ...". He called the Ukrainian embroidery Tarashevchenko, who, while living in a foreign land, always dressed it for big holidays.</p>
<p>Ukrainian embroidery is of extremely ancient origin. Research historians are thinking that it has begun to create folk craftsmen before the age. What it was then - it is unknown, since no model lived on the day.</p>
<p>Historians-researchers are inclined to think that it was created by folk-miles before the VI century</p>
<p>Instead, it is known that only women were embroidered with national clothing, giving the works of positive energy: Ukrainian embroidery symbolized the good, loyalty, love and other virtues inherent in our ancestors. We also know that the craft on the manufacture of mother's embroidery was passed on to her daughters. And those are descendants.</p>
<p>Reference. Some historical sources say that, in addition to drawing, the magic pattern was also applied to the Cossack body in the form of a rush. Here is what Mikhail Chugenko writes in the book "Shocking Ukraine": _ "Warriors ... Before the belt, or in wolf or bear skins, which better than other armor, protected from a blow to a spear or sword. Their body berrkers covered with black or red tattoos that had a magical property. ”_</p>
<p>To say that those who dressed the embroidery were always persecuted, it would not be completely believed. But the attitude towards such people has always different. For example, during the Russian Tsarism, some representatives of intelligence openly wore embroidery, once again confirming their nationality. But not everyone could do so. In addition, Lysenko, who worked in the theater, could not afford something.

<p>About this <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/zaiava-mzs-ukrainy-z-nahody-79-i-richnytsi-deportatsii-krymskykh-tatar-ta-vshanuvannia-zhertv-henotsydu-krymskotatarskoho-narodu">it is referred</a>In the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on the occasion of the 79th anniversary of the Crimean Tatars and honoring the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar.</p>
<p>"They are convinced that only the victory of Ukraine and the liberation of the Crimean peninsula may put an end to systemic repression against the indigenous Crimean Tatar and restore respect for human rights in the world," the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.</p>
<p>On May 18, 2023, the age of 79 has been granted for the forced deportation of Crimean Tatars - one of the most horrific crimes of the Soviet totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>In 1944, the USSR accused the Crimean Tatar people in cooperation with the Nazi authorities, which became a far -fetched reason to launch deportation. In violation of the rules of international law, the Soviet governmental act of genocide to erase the national identity of the Crimean Tatar - the indigenous people of Ukraine, prohibiting the use of the mother tongue, professing their religion and preserving their own culture.</p>
<p>"We remember those who have suffered from this tragedy, and we give the truthful Tatar people who have undergone and continue to reinforce repression by the Russian Empire, the USSR, and now in modern Russia," Ukraine has declared in the foreign policy department of Ukraine.</p>
<p>After the temporary occupation of Crimea in 2014 and the widespread coordination of Russia in Ukraine in February 2022, Crimea actually became a huge open -air prison and a place for concealment of crimes of the Russian Federation. More than 180 citizens of Ukraine were imprisoned on the basis of politically and religious persecution in Crimea.</p>
<p>"We demand from the Russian Federation to stop human rights violations of the occupied territory of the Crimea and Sevastopol, immediately to all political prisoners, to ensure full compliance with the RFAK's obligations of the occupying state in accordance with international law,"-said in the statement of Ukraine.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T52-00-00-04-00/01_panych.jpg" />This reasoning was expressed by the Doctor of Philosophy, the Leading Scientific Trade of NGO "Spirit and Letter" Alexei Panich during the work of the round table "Rashism. Understand to overcome. ”</p>
<p>Answering the question of whether the defeat of the Russian Federation will be entrusted to the collapse of Rashism as an aggressive ideology, regime and political practice, the expert noted that Russia's peace is impossible without the deconstruction of the Imperian state. In his opinion, the decentralization of the aggressor state must be controlled and transformed into a confederation with a frequent loss of individual regions, especially the Caucasus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Russia can not be aggressive in its current borders. It cannot be given to the fact that we will pour it with money, it will develop market -economic and there will be a regular incentive for the West for the production of high -added cost production, ”Alexei Panich assured.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T52-00-00-04-00/02-13.jpg" />The scientist insists that it is impossible to leave Russia centralized, there is no way to allow it to be a chaotic disintegration, to which the aggressor state is now shaking.</p>
<ul>
<li>The third and only acceptable option is a controlled decentralization of Russia's construct for some confederation, and partly simply with the departure of the separate territories, starting with the Caucasus, - summed up the expert.</li>
</ul>
<p>This thesis should be promoted as much as possible among Western politicians of and intellectuals, most of whom now hopes for the possibility of liberal-democratic reforms in the Russian Federation after defeat in the war of anti-Ukraine. In fact, Russia is unable to turn into a liberal deconstruction of the imperial state.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T55-00-00-04-00/01_pavlenko.jpg" />Institutional and economic insolvency and depopulation are the main problems of modern Russian Federation, which will inevitably destroy the aggressor state state,-says Candidate of Historical Sciences, Head of the Department of National Strategic Studies Department Irina Pavlenko. These reasoning was expressed by a round table "Rashism. Understand to submit. "</p>
<p>The expert reminded that the Russian Federation has a huge but little -populated affordable economically developed territory. The maintenance of such an extremely large space steadily becomes an increasingly heavier burden for Russia, which is eventually unbearable.</p>
<ul>
<li>In trying to keep this territory under control, they constantly increase the equipment that should keep it under control. And the apparatus that must be monitored by the apparatus. That is, they have two -thirds of the population today, starting with the disabled and ending with the military, - Irinapavalenko emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of the steady growth of the management apparatus and the increase in the number of officials are increased regulation and deterioration of the management of the management. And the predominance of state employees in the structure of the population leads to the good of resources for social expenditures.</p>
<ul>
<li>I bet on sanctions and financial inability, - said the expert. - All this can be kept and held through the budget. Money is taken away, money is redistributed. The less the money you redistributed, Thorano or late in the same Vladivostok, the question that was already in the 1990s: why do we and Moscow? What does she define?</li>
</ul>
<p>Gradually, the situation should lead to an increase in regional separatism decentralization or even the collapse of the Russian Federation. This process, according to researchers, will probably not be instant, but long -lasting. It is necessary to be hosted that it will be delayed for years or even decades.</p>
<ul>
<li>mechanisms that will strengthen their institutional and economicability should work. That is the history of long -term collapse, it is a long history, Cemaraphone, - summed up Irina Pavlenko.</li>

<p>Since last night, several waves of rocket attacks took place, and for a air intelligence the enemy launched several drones. The invaders were attacked from the sea, from the air and from ground launches.</p>
<p>Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Air Force of Ukraine, reported this in the Unified News Telelorphone.</p>
<p>He reported that the enemy launched 30 winged missiles. Eight of them, which were released from Russian ships in the Black Sea, were destroyed in the southern direction.</p>
<p>-The enemy also raised his strategic aviation-up to ten Tu-95 aircraft, Tu-160, which released more than 20 missiles,-said the spokesman of the Air Force forces of Ukraine. - The peculiarity of this attack can be called that this one -time was the use of ballistic missiles, the enemy was limited only by wing.</p>
<p>The officer noted that even when the air battle has a successful result, the wreckage always falls to the ground, resulting in fire, and trauma, and, unfortunately, the death of people. Therefore, he once again urged all the safety rules in the event of an alarm.</p>
<ul>
<li>The capital is attacked most often, so it is a city that obviously needs more protection. But today, eight rockets were knocked down over Odesa. Eastern and northern regions - there is also a very serious vector of work and there is also a prototype defense. Therefore, we distribute our forces where it is most necessary, - said Yuri Ignat. - We also have a lot of strategic objects that also need cover. Despite the fact that we get from the event of multi -varied air defense systems, there are still not enough. We need to further settle our air defense system.</li>

<ul>
<li>From the point of view of the deployment of an electronic queue for recording for the examination of the health care of health care, it is undoubtedly necessary to create an electronic resource, on which you can see the reception schedule and enroll the hospital. However, this is not enough to ensure the recording of servicemen on the electronic queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary for military hospitals and military units to have the necessary supplies, that is, computers, internet connections and medical information system - <strong> This is the first stage </strong>.</p>
<p><strong> The second stage </strong>, of course, is that the internal order is working out, who will form a schedule for doctors, who will administer the electronic resource is the question that needs to be identified at the level of health care facility. And <strong> The third stage </strong> is to inform military units about the order and the algorithmia for recording servicemen for inspection of the VLK through the electronic queue. The dial recording of servicemen for inspection is carried out by the chief service and medical service. But because many military units are currently in the areas of fighting, they do not have access to the Internet of or other resource support, therefore are not able to record their military servicemen for medical examinations through electronic queue, bringing to the inspection without recording, this creates some difficulties for the establishment of establishments. In which the electronic queue is already working - said Oksana Gorbach.</p>
<p>She said that in this case, the issue of passing the VLK for military servicemen is decided, so to speak in "manual mode".The issue of deployment of an electronic queue for the inspection of the VLK is a question that should be processed at the level of the hospital and at the level of the military unit, and therefore the deployment of an electronic queue takes some time. Coordination and support of this process is engaged in a working group to improve the processes of passing Vilk. Currently, the electronic queue is deployed in a test mode in 5 garrisons, the following are planned. - said Ms. Gorbach.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T78-00-00-04-00/foto-2-1.jpeg" />Until the Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine occupied in Europe in the number of museums one of the leading places. Over the past 14 months, many of them have been irreparable. And many of those who were in the territory that looked at the dirty boot of the Russian soldier or is still temporary, partially, or even fully destroyed, or Barbarian robbed today.</p>
<p>For example, in the Kyiv region, in Mariupol, Zaporozhye and other Ukrainian cities, unless they were destroyed when "liberation" of these settlements, they were toponed.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, the Nazis were known to be "indifferent to all the beautiful, reflected in the museums", as chef Ssenrich Himmler said. Therefore, in the occupied territories, they destroyed museums, more valuable exhibits. Today, they do the racists, having sniffed from the museumchherson, Mariupol, Melitopol, Kakhovka many exhibits. They will soon appear - if you do not appear - in the museums of Perm, Vologda, Cheboksar. And perhaps in the Hermitage, which is so stuffed with exhibits that have nothing to do with Russia.</p>
<p>I do not thicken the paint: the paintings stolen from the Kherson Art Museum, nowadays in the Tavrida Museum in Simferopol. This is, in particular, the picture of Ivanapokhitonov "Picket on the river bank. Sunset ”, written in 1890 with oil. The second canvas is Pavel Sokolov's "House at sunset", owned by the Museum Assembly of the Museum Assembly, too. According to the adviser of the mayor Mariupolyapetra Andryushchenko, the Russian military removed all valuable exhibits from the Museum of Studies and the Art Museum. Quinji, in Mariupol. In particular, the originals of Archip Quinji and Ivan Aivazovsky's paintings.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T78-00-00-04-00/foto-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Any conscious Vinnytsia or Vinnytsia will twist the temple fingerbread after heard. And this is at least. Well, at the maximum, Masha will indicate the course "Following the Russian ship". After all, the museum she remembers is a long -standing state of national, it is in excellent condition, as it was, the street, which has Pirogov. Like the Medical University: no one has renamed them and is impossible to rename them. But he sits in Katsapetovka some katsapchuk and, hearing from the hangover, will also assume that we have the Nazis.</p>
<p>But how else, if the disadvantageous professional academicians believe in these "revelations"? At least so they say from TV screens. In general, Zakharova believes that in the world "demons Russia, they conduct" violent Ukrainianization, support culture of all Russian. " The fact is that a few months ago, the experts of the Oonpoli reported that Russia continues to "blamed the history of Tasamobvity of the Ukrainian people to justify the war and hatred." It appears that among the important cultural sites of Ukraine, which affected the shelling, are museums, libraries and churches. I would like to remind that the representatives of this war registered about 250 cultural sites of Ukraine during the year of this war, which were injured or destroyed by war, resolved. Among them are dozens of museums.</p>
<p>If someone has a question, what kind of devil Masha so brazenly lies about the museum of Pirogov, I answer: and about something else, talking about Ukraine, is she what, the truth says? But there are other answer options. With this delusion, she wants to somehow send Russian power, which neglected hundreds of Russian museums. First of all, which, in decent slang, is in the so-called depth. And if in other words, then in a shaken Tmutarakan, like Muscovites themselves, living in Moscow or St. Petersburg, call their surroundings.</p>
<p>The Russians who were expelled from the occupied cities and villages continue to be broken. Among the objects "successfully destroyed by high -precision strokes" are the imums. Yes, the racists recently struck the Kupyansk museum that Nakarkiv region. The museum employees were killed - 54 and 57 years old. Their tillarymen got out of the rubble for several hours ...</p>

<ul>
<li>What the Russian military was committed and committed in the territory of Ukraine can not be unpunished. This is a special international tribunal or name it "Nuremberg -2" as you want.

The male day, by order of Dictator Joseph Stalin, about 200,000 Crimean Tatars were deported in railway carriages for thousands of kilometers from alien to East Asia. This was the culmination of ethnic purges and the persecution of the Crimean people by Soviet invaders.</p>
<p>It is symbolic that today's memory of the victims of the Genocukrim Tatar people "Remember the history - we return the territory" organized by the office of the Ombudsman of Ukraine, the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people, the public organization of the Crimean Rights and the ZMINA Human Rights Center.</p>
<h3><strong> The greatest war crime of genocide that took place in the history of the USSR </strong></h3>
<p>Dmitry Lubinets, the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, told about why they chose exactly the place for the event and how much it is elaboular to the Crimean Tatars.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T86-00-00-04-00/foto-1-12.jpg" />- Every year on May 18, the world celebrates the Victims of the Genocchukrim Tatar people. When preparing this event, we very long learned which object to choose for it. Frankly, it was not easy to hold an event on the station - it was not easy, because it is clear that for the Crimean Tatars the station, the railway is a tragic story. Alevese, however, we come from the fact that the most tragic pages of our history we have to forget. We need to remember them, so today we are here to understand how difficult it was for those people who were thrown out of their own wards, loaded simply as a cattle, in railway cars and sent an incomprehensible direction, and no one understood what was waiting there. In fact, the Tseni's greater war crime of genocide, which took place in the history of the Soviet Union, unfortunately, did not give any punishment for it, - Dmitry Lubinets said.</p>
<p>The First Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine Emine Dzhaparova told vivid memories of his life, who concerned childhood on the occupied half and, in her opinion, could serve a mouthpiece for the current "Crimean lesson".</p>

During which the attendees heard an excerpt from a diary of a 13-year-old teenager Narimanakazenbash, who in 1944 was deported by the Crimea together with other Crimean Tatars.</p>
<h3><strong> “We are simply obliged to deduct Ukrainian Crimea” </strong></h3>
<p>Another guest of the event was the Viceremier-Minister-Minister of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk, who resolved about the role and importance of indigenous peoples in the reconstruction and de-occupation of Krym.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T86-00-00-04-00/foto-5-7.jpg" />- We are simply obliged to deduct Ukrainian Crimea and restore the Ukrainian statehood. We multiply the experience that everyone who has come to and has resisted in the totalitarian system for many years, the regeneration of the younger generation. We need to consider the restoration of Crimea in the context of which the indigenous residents see it. This is the combination of our Ukrainian state and tradition of understanding the spirit and earth, the feeling that the peninsula is needed more and more, the indigenous people are needed. It is this combination of the larger that will not allow us to mock us, to do genocide and to think that it will all go with impunity. We will definitely restore our Ukrainian Crimea, - said Irina Vereshchuk.</p>

<p>At any moment, the recording of this appeal can be interrupted by a siren of air anxiety. It is one sentence briefly and accurately describes the state of global security and the level of threats that it faces today.</p>
<p>I congratulate all the participants of the second Strategic Ark and an important dialogue about salary. The decisive battle for his future lasts 449 days. Today is special. This forum takes place on a sign date - May 18. The day in which the history left us many tips and lessons. Casting and errors that we have the right to repeat on the way to our global security.</p>
<p>It was May 18, 1792, when the hundred thousand army crossed the borders of the Commonwealth and invaded its land. The Russo-Polish War began, the consequences of which we all remember.</p>
<p>Today is the same enemy. The same goal. The same price of defeat. We do not have to lose. We do not have the right to weaken the resistance for a moment, to oppose, we have the right not to squeeze evil, to lose the unity of the allies, prematurely lay down, not fight for the final victory.</p>
<p>We do not have the right to mislead when Russia begins to speak actively, talk about diplomacy. Russia is not concerned about the end of bloodshed, the nitrogen of money, resources to continue it.</p>
<p>Russia is needed not peace, but time. For new rockets, a new plan, a new attack. It is a Russian policy. Unchanged for centuries. XXI should be for her last. The mechanisms for the implementation of this contain the Ukrainian formula of peace. Security guarantees, so that this is never repeated.</p>
<p>Not repeated on May 18, 1944. Genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. Primus deportation and loss of their home for decades. All that modern Russia, calling herself the successors and followers of the totalitarian regime, repeated in Crimea in 2014. And repeated eight years in Donbass, Umariupol, Kherson.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable evil is always returning. Without the international tribunal, bringing the reference of all Russian military criminals to return.</p>
<p>We have often heard the words "destruction of international security architecture". On February 24, they were embodied in clear visual forms. The destroyed houses in Bucha, Borodyanka, Uman, Gostomel, Mariupol - this is how security architecture looks today.For our ancestors, falcon is a blessed sky synthesis of reason, courage, youth and strength. Light. Victory. The song "Hey, the Falcons" of the Hundred Little Battle of Ukrainians and Poles into a common battle <strong> </strong> ** for ours and your freedom.</p>
<p>Today, our benches are much larger. And just like a hundred years ago, we will again seek the parade on Khreshchatyk. For ours and your victory!Ukraine. Europe. World.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to remember one more May 18. Last year. The day that Natootod the application for the entry of two new members. The speed at which Finland passed and the high prospects of Sweden give Ukraine confidence and Viruu Vilnius NATO summit. In the determination of the Alliance and the will to confirm your choice of the value of the values of freedom and the indivisibility of security. The fact that in July we will be honored with a new important stage on the path of Ukraine to NATO membership. In the way of the period and safe future. Ukraine. Europe. The world. Humanity.</p>

During this day-at night and afternoon, about 14.50, there were two blows from the Belgorod region, pre-rockets C-300, the settlement of circus, near Kharkiv.</p>
<p>According to the head of the Media Sector of Media of the Main Directorate of the SESU in Kharkiv region Vasylenko Yevgeny, two residential private homes were arranged as a result of the hit, and several more were damaged. Unfortunately, a 52-year-old resident of the village was killed. The body of rescuers was removed from the rubble.</p>
<p>The village of Tsirkuni is one of the most affected settlements from Russian aggression in Kharkiv region. According to the head of Kharkiv region Volodymyrimoshko, the circuses got to the housing recovery program. Law enforcement considers that this factor has attracted the attention of Russian terrorists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Circusrs from May to October last year were constantly undergoing enemy -hatreds and suffered great destruction, many locals were killed, many were timeless. We believe that these blows are associated with the fact that the Russians are trying to seize the local population and make it panic. There is no other reason, since there are no military bases and objects in the settlement, and Ukrainian servicemen do not carry out any fighting.</li>

The journalists of the Armyinform were interested in the impressions of the famous printed edition in the army of Sumy region.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T95-00-00-04-00/maksym.jpeg" />-I really liked the social and legal issues that are considered by the expenses and issues related to certain life situations. I like that here is perfect and quite step by step. I learned many useful things for myself, - said the serviceman Maxim.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T95-00-00-04-00/anna.jpeg" />- It is quite convenient that the edition is in A5 format, can always be at hand. The first pages are attracted, in particular, the passage of the VLK, the main tades of financial support of servicemen. Also, I follow the Stoperative and Current Information on the website of the Armyinform and even the material for classes from one of their articles. These are quite interesting materials, I wanted this digest to be larger in volume and directly with questions about changes in the legislation. Perhaps it would be better to make crossword puzzles, anecdotes, etc. You still want more such a publication in order to distribute it to civilian organizations and institutions, - Anna says a military serviceman.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T95-00-00-04-00/olena-1-scaled.jpeg" />- Briefly, clearly and creatively revealed issues of mobilization, conscription and other topical issues of military service. Color style is also very beautiful, infographic is good. I would like to add consideration of problematic issues, what worries our military the most, and step -by -step instructions for their implementation, - said the serviceman Elena.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-18T95-00-00-04-00/angelina.jpeg" />- It seems such a small book. There is a lot here. In my opinion, we must forget about our veterans and this issue is quite urgent to consider. The section "Business for Veterans" is quite relevant to the present. Legal assistance for our military is very important to consider it with specific examples that have already taken place. The names on the prophecies of Taras Shevchenko were very much liked, - said military personnel.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent in New York, a consistent representative of Ukraine at the United Nations Sergey Kislytsa said at a meeting of the UN Security Council, which was convened by Moscow to "condemn" the supply of weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>"There are two options in the Rashist Criminal Bunner: either to see, or to repeat what happened in another bunker on April 30, 1945," Kyslyts said, without name.</p>
<p>He stressed that Ukraine will continue to fight, “until every Ukrainian citizen and every piece of our sovereign land will not be released but <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>It does not suffer a military defeat in Ukraine. "</p>

<p>According to him, "it is time for Russian hordes to withdraw their troops of Ukraine without any delay - and not on cars stolen from the Ukrainian population."</p>

He got time to fulfill the guidance of your boss, who in January last year had the arrogance to say that it was time for you to perform it for yourself: "collect manat and go" at the turn of 1991.</p>
<p>As it was reported, in January 2022 Ryabkov stated that NATO had "to collect and go at the turn of 1997."</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent in New York, a consistent representative of Ukraine at the United Nations Sergey Kislytsa said at a meeting of the UN Security Council, which was convened by Moscow to "condemn" the supply of weapons to Ukraine.</p>
<p>"There are two options in the Rashist Criminal Bunner: either to see, or to repeat what happened in another bunker on April 30, 1945," Kyslyts said, without name.</p>
<p>He stressed that Ukraine will continue to fight, “until every Ukrainian citizen and every piece of our sovereign land will not be released but <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>It does not suffer a military defeat in Ukraine. "</p>

<p>"If Russia is interested in survival, it should grasp this resolution as a charging circle, and go the way to the peace that it outlines," - it is an acid.</p>
