![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-23T-134-56-00-03-00/630_360_1684854119-337.jpg)MMETA has sold Giphy, online data bases and a search engine that allows users to search and share with animated GIF files, a Shchetterstock, for $ 53 million.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/23/facebook-owner-meta-sells-giphy-shutterstock-gif-search?utm_term=Autofeed&CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1684846854)

[ ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-meta)She said on Tuesday, May 23, which gave Giphy, which she purchased in November 2021 for about $ 315 million, but the British regulator forbade her to complete the Capid in 2022.

Shutterstock, which provides high quality licensed photos, illustrations, 3D models, videos and music to users and brands around the world will pay for Giphy in cash.

Executive Director Shutterstock Paul Hennesssey noted that the acquisition was "an exciting next step in the Shutterstock way as a creative platform."

** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-technology/3708226-u-meta-pocali-testuvati-reklamni-instrumenti-na-osnovi-stucnogo-intelektu.html)As reported by Ukrinform, the Department of Competition and the Britain Market and the Market(SMA)Meta has obliged to sell Giphy, an online hypersonal system that allows users to search and share with animated GIF files.

The regulator called the reason "the possible reduction of competition by inter -platforms of social networks, and the increase of the already significant impact of the META is."

This is reported by Ukrinform in New York.

First, "the famine remains an important element in the toolkit of the aggressor to subjugate the defense capability of the state to which he attacked, and the suppression of civilian regulations in the occupied territories," Kyslytsy said.

He recalled that from the beginning of the invasion of Moscow resorts to the blocking of humanitarian corridors and access to the surrounding and occupied territories.

"Hunger was also used as torture against the detainees in the occupied territories and Ukrainian prisoners of war," Postpred added.

To this end, the aggressor tries to undermine multilateral initiatives to respond to crisis, in the case of the Russian war is the Black Sea Grain, he explained

Third, the armed conflict causes "mine pollution of agricultural land, as well as the destruction of critical infrastructure, which undermines production, distribution and access to food and water", Kyslytsy said.

In particular, thousands of mines and other explosive objects were scattered on Ukrainian agricultural lands with an area of more than 4700 sq. Km.

Fourth, in the belief of post-press, [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon)should play an important role in global efforts aimed at overcoming the consequences of the war for the civilian population.

Kyslytsya reminded the words of the UN Secretary General Guterres from his speech, which he proclaimed a few hours ago: "War means hunger."** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3700628-evropi-potribni-ukrainski-silskogospodarski-tovari-solskij.html)According to Kislytsya, Ukraine is not the first time opposing the Kremlin practices of food as weapons.

He noted that this year marks the 90th anniversary of the great famine caused by the Stalinist regime, which took away the lives of millions of people in Ukraine.

"These painful memories are now one of the main sources of Ukrainian resistance to contemporary ties," Postperd added.

As reported by Ukrinform, on Tuesday, the UN Security Council, which in May presides the chairman, holds open debate to protect civilians in armed conflicts. UN Secretary General, speaking in its [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3713222-zahist-civilnih-u-zbrojnih-konfliktah-guterres-u-radbezi-oon-ne-zgadav-pro-zertvi-sered-ukrainciv.html)Black Sea Initiative.

На думку Болдуіна, західні країни мають надати Україні F-16 «прямо зараз».

«Якби Україна отримала ці літаки ще рік тому, то ситуація була б набагатокращою. Набагато менше було б жертв серед цивільного населення, серед дітей,набагато менше було б зруйнованої інфраструктури. Тобто політики самі малюютьці червоні лінії для себе, щоб запобігти ескалації. І потім все ж таки вони тілінії переступають. Як військовий командувач я розумію, що коли наді мною вповітрі є такі потужні літаки, як F-16, вони допоможуть мені й у повітрі, й унанесенні наземних ударів. Тому гадаю, що за допомогою такої зброї українськаармія набагато впевненіше себе почувала б на полі бою», - зазначив генерал.

This conclusion was reached by experts of the German economic group, who advises the Ukrainian government, Ukrinform reports.

“A reliable land transit corridor is not only decisive not only for Ukraine but also for international food security. Finally, this political state will continue to play an important role in the process of Ukraine's accession of Ukraine, ”the analytical note states.

Experts recall that in April this year, Ukrainian agro -food export received a serious blow: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgariasaboronized the import of grain, oilseeds and many other food products from Ukraine by the end of June. In addition, Poland banned transit.

"Unilateral and sudden decisions to ban import and transit are inconsistency with the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU and the EU and WTO jointline norms," experts emphasize.

But this event also contains rapeseed and sunflower seeds, which have been using non -EU regimes for many years.

After two weeks of consultation, the European Commission has announced the replacement(By June 5)EU-prohibiting the imports of wheat, corn, rapeseed and seeds to five EU member states, including Romania, but not transit.

The EU ban covers $ 0.4 billion in Ukraine's monthly exports(close -up of general exports of this product by Ukraine), in April, Ukrainian agro -food exports to four countries that introduced banners fell by 68% -up to $ 0.1 billion.

The reorientation of Ukraine to other countries has led to new delays and additional costs, according to conclusions, experts say.

However, the EU decision did not decide trade uncertainty. Countries have already urged the expansion and duration of restrictions, while other Emergency Member States are concerned about the consequences for free trade in the EU's inner market.On April 21, transit through Poland was restored. However, additional ones, including convoy and GPS trackers, were put forward. Ukrainian exporters have informed the transit delays and large queues at the border. In addition, exports that needed overload or waiting in ports remained difficult.

Recall that the prohibition began to protest farmers and the need to run into the market and damage to producers suffering from a low valuable background of activation [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-eksport)Grain from Ukraine EU initiative on autonomous trade measures and "ways of solidarity".

Indeed, the physical volume of Ukrainian imports in the EU doubled from 7.9 million tons in 20121 to 16.0 million tons in 2022. One -third of additional import comes to five neighboring countries, with Poland imported an additional 2.4 million tons in 2022 compared to 2021, followed by Romania and Hungary(+1.3 million tons).

«Однак вплив цього припливу зерна на ринки сусідніх країн неочевидний», -стверджують економісти. Ринкові ціни на зерно впали у перші місяці 2023 рокупорівняно з піком навесні 2022 року, але так і залишилися значно вищими задовоєнний рівень.

It would be the best to have a ban, but the current agreement retains access to the EU and other countries through transit. And, formally, the solution. On the other hand, this decision requires a significant short -term re -orientation, which means additional losses in addition to those that are performed by exporters through prohibitions, is indicated in the conclusions.

About it the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets [reported](https://t.me/dmytro_lubinetzs/2507)In the telegram.

“Not far from the village of Kirovske on the night of May 18 to 19, the employees of the Russian DPS detained the 29-year-old Crimean Tatar Mambeth Asan-Usta. They brought the man to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation to draw up an administrative protocol of insurance and promised to return him to the car that remained remained. At the same time, the Russians did not do so, but brought out Mambeth because of the official output, where he was waiting for a Volkswagen minibus and people in the military form of masks. They attacked the man, tied and forcefully planted in the car. For a version of the abducted, he was taken to Simferopol, where in an unknown apartment began interrogation about the relationship of the man with Ukraine and damage to the village in the village of Puretsenko, Simferopol district. After all, there was an explosion in the morning of May 18, which is why a few cars with grain came off the rails. The occupation of the peninsula accused Ukraine of this incident. People in the military form continued to threaten the massacre of the Crimean Tatar, inclining it to sign unknown documents. They also wanted Mambeth to pass the polygraph, but the man refused.

I would like to point out that since the beginning of the occupation of Crimea in February 2014, the rights of citizens of Ukraine have been violated by the Russian Federation. The abduction of people, illegalization, fabricated cases, deprivation of the right to a fair court is the crime for which _r_ axis should be punished.

—To today, 181 persons are illegally held in Crimea and Russia by the premium and/or religiously motivated affairs.

According to the rules of international law, Russia is obliged to immediately stop Tzlochyna, ”Dmitry Lubinets wrote.

About this [the one was talking](https://t.me/Koord_shtab/1098)During a meeting with the family servicemen of the National Guard Service of Ukraine on a coordinating product on the management of prisoners of war.

“Who and how captured is not taken into account. There are stitches, they also need to be turned, ”the headquarters noted.

The native people are concerned that the Russians sometimes fire our troops from the territory of the Ukrainian prisoners, using them as a "live shield".

“According to international humanitarian law, the responsibility for the captives of the dishonestron who holds them. But we are doing our best to improve the conditions of detention under pressure from the International Community and to do everything possible for the safety of prisoners, ”the headquarters representative emphasized.

He also noted that at the present stage from captivity it is possible to return both the confirmed by Russia of prisoners and not confirmed.

"We have proposed some initiatives on confirmation-the answer to the aggressor. The aggressor country confirms the people through the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ignoring the Russian side of the mechanism of confirmation is a violation of humanitarian law," the meeting said.

It is also easier for lawyers and human rights defenders to find prisoners in Russia and by the occupied territories after they have received a sentence because then then they appear in the relevant Russian registers. Currently, the exchanged prisoners and those who are investigating are being exchanged.

“The exchange fund is replenished daily. Exchanges in any case depend on the front. Now we can manage risks, but it is too early to predict something - the war is still ongoing, ”the headquarters representative summed up.

“The warriors of the three elements - the earth, water and heaven today celebrate their day. A day of night horror in the berets of the color of the storm wave, ”Oleksireznikov wrote.

He recalled that during the years of ATO/OOS, Ukrainian Marines argued every time: where they have a position they are - there will be non -conversations.

“The start of the large -scale war was met at the forefront, where the titanic courage was shown and the enemy was difficult to describe the enemy. And today they are in the release of Ukrainian land from invaders. The enemy should be thoughtful: even at such a difficult time, we form new units of infantry, which will inevitably bring them closer to the Cobzon concert.

It is proud that I have friends among Ukrainian marines, proud that samples of wedge weapons come to them, proud to be Ukrainian near them.

Happy Holidays, Break!Semper fi!” - said Alexei Reznikov.

“Avdiivka has been with a dignity and steadily standing rashist invasion since 2014. In their pragmatism, the rashists resort to the tactics of the scorched earth.

— Авіаційна коаліція широка, українських пілотів навчатиме низка країн. Наразітриває процес підготовки людей до навчання на F-16. Створено передові групи,які виїхали до тих країн, що надали нам навчальні майданчики. Вивчається, яксаме відбуватиметься дана підготовка, кількість пілотів, часові терміни тощо.У відрядження направлятимуть не лише льотчиків, а й авіаційних інженерів таофіцерів бойових управлінь. Старт навчанню даний — і це головне, — зауваживармієць.

Він уточнив, що всіх військових пілотів одразу ж відправити не можна. Аджекомусь треба забезпечувати дії Сил оборони України. За час війни льотчикиздобули певних професійних висот. Тому поїдуть за кордон підготовленими.

— Кожен курсант Харківського національно університету Повітряних Сил післявипуску у своєму активі вже має по 200 годин нальоту. Далі в бойових бригадахвони вже опановують різні навички пілотування. Наразі ж іде мова про їхнєперенавчання на інший тип літака. Як порівняти з радянським МіГ-29,закордонний F-16 є більш автоматизованим. Але це не означає, що буде легко, —розповів речник Командування Повітряних Сил.

Говорячи про терміни підготовки на F-16, офіцер зауважив, що підготовкукожного льотчика варто розглядати індивідуально, враховуючи ті завдання, щовиконуватиме його авіаційна бригада.

"When I was serving in the army, one of my best comrades was Bashkir.

Thousands of men from Bashkirria were killed or crippled.

The situation impressed me with my absurdity. And she pushed her to write a native to my friend, the whole Bashkir people and his true leaders.

Today's Ufa authorities, taking care of personal gain and working in the interests of Kreml, send its people to death.

Bashkiri is one of the largest peoples of Russia, which is at the same time a uniform situation.

In modern Bashkiria there are three commemorative national groups - Russian, Bashkir and Tatars. The Republic of Bashkortostan has huge natural resources and developed industry. There is everything there to guarantee a high level of pre -production.

The main interest of Bashkir is obvious - to ensure national development in itself in itself, including - through the exercise of the right to self -determination of the truthful distribution of considerable resources in favor of the region.

To do this, you need to concentrate all efforts within Bashkirria and the protection of Moscow.

If you list the problems and threats to the Bashkir people, the cause of them is not Ukraine or Ukrainians. The roots of all reasons - in Moscow and in Ufa.

Instead, Bashkir is sent to die for a thousand kilometers for what.

No one but the Kremlin and its lackeys are interested in it.

This should be stopped as soon as possible.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-23T71-00-00-04-00/20230523-2.jpg)The emergence of a number of so -called private military companies in the temporarily occupied Crimea is primarily associated with the increase in fear among the Russian occupiers of the hardware of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Chernyak told about it, [reports](https://gur.gov.ua/content/strakh-pered-kontrnastupom-zs-ukrainy.html)GUR MOU.

"The invaders clearly understand that the fighting in the Crimea will be, and they will build fortifications, defensive lines - not only in the Crimea, but also in the Soviet Farms," - explained Andrey Chernyak.

The representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine added that the leaders of the occupying power to the peninsula will worry because of disappointment by the Russian army: who knows whether it will be waded to protect their families and looted property in Crimea.

“These private armies have been designed to protect occupation administrations because of the realization that Russia's armed forces will be able to protect them. And secondly, they are not sure of the integrity of the Russian Federation. If Russia begins to "fall", then they will have "PVC", which will protect their wealth, families, " - said a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.

According to Andriy Chernyak, the so -called Crimean PECs from various sources are financed: for example, the leader of the occupation administration of Crimea was collected by Aksyonov there and forced money to allocate money for his private army.

“On the one hand, Crimean businessmen are forced to do it, but on the other, they also want to protect themselves and their wealth. The invaders guarantee them that they are evacuated if they are evacuated, and everything will be well, ”Andrey Chernyak said.

The representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the so-called "Aksionovtsi" fighters receive from 200 to 250 thousand rubles a month, train mainly on the bases of preference and temporarily occupied Kherson region, and the instructors for them are professionally trained by Russian military with combat experience: Several times a higher salary - from $ 5,000 or more.

Novens to the Crimean PVC are recruited so as not to compete with his "Wagner": "They are recruited among the mobilized, created double -contraints with PVK and the Ministry of Defense. They are trying to attract the Krym population first, but in addition, they take measures throughout Russia, ” - said the representative of the GUR of Ukraine."In totalitarian Russia, there can be no paramilitary formations that would be subordinate to the power structures," the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence emphasized.

— На Бахмутському напрямку протягом минулої доби було лише три бойовізіткнення. Щоправда, ворог був активний у плані артилерійських ударів — 404рази. Тож про снарядний голод у них не йдеться. У цих боях було знищено 79окупантів, дві самохідні артустановки «Гіацинт» та «Гвоздика», а також 9гармат типу «Мста», Д-20 і Д-30. Окрім цього, знищено 7 БПЛА різних типів, —повідомив офіцер.

Він уточнив, що «вагнерівці» щодня зазнають величезних втрат: до 100 осібвбитими та стільки ж — пораненими. Тому вони давно б відступили, але їхніватажки гонять їх на українські кулі, виставляють за ними «загороджувальнізагони» тощо. Тож усі гучні «заяви» євгена пригожина слід розглядати вконтексті гри на публіку.

— Усі ці місяці ми проводили ефективну оборонну операцію зі сточуванняможливостей ворога, знищували його бойовий потенціал. Не маючи переваги вособовому складі, ми успішно використовували слабкі місця ворога, нестандартнітактичні прийоми. В ході такої активної оборони за найменшої можливості миконтратакували противника. Іноді ми просувалися на 250–1000 метрів, але це бувреальний успіх, а не вигадана пропагандистська брехня, як в окупантів, —зауважив полковник Сергій Череватий.

"The so -called" medical examinations "in temporarily occupied territories are only a fiction that Russians use as an excuse for further export of children to the Russian Federation. Make medical examinations are not actually conducted, but children are put invented and use it to take them out" for treatment " medical institutions of the Russian Federation. " - The message says.

Is stated. That this procedure is a component of the state policy of the Russian Federation, directed by the genocide of Ukrainians. Thus, the Government of the Russian Federation has allocated more than 1.4 million rubles for "preventive medical examinations" in 2023. The process is managed by Putin for the rights of children Maria Lviv-Belov. On March 17, 2023, the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued a warrant for the arrest of Lviv-Belova and Putin for illegal deportation of Ukrainian children.

The National Resistance Center calls the residents of the Tot in no way to let the children on any "medical examinations" conducted by the invaders. This is more likely that children will be forcibly taken out for treatment to the Russian Federation, where they will eventually get to the Russian children's homes.

He also noted that Ukraine "made Putin's plans for the ambulance dispelled, and we must continue to support her protection."

According to Josep Borrel, "Ukraine's support is not exhaustion." “On the contrary, I show what we have to do: give it the tools needed for effective protection, and do it as soon as possible and in the most appropriate quantities. Ukraine is a strong support and the defense ministers are determined to provide it, ”the EU's High Representative and Security Policy said.

### Text speech by high representative Josepa Borrel at a press conference

“The Defense Council today focused on our military support for Ukraine. For this purpose, we also had the presence of NATO Secretary General Jenstoltenberg, with whom we shared an analysis of the military situation in this war.

And, of course, all defense ministers have expressed their readiness to continue Ukraine. We have reviewed Ukraine support activities. First of all, the ESU mission of military assistance to support Ukraine [Eumam Ukraine]. Many European countries are taking part in it and 20,000 Ukrainian military will be held through these training centers. And at that rate, without a doubt, by the end of the year, we will reach the numbers of 30 thousand soldiers, which was twice as much as they were at first.

All defense ministers have agreed that it was an extraordinary success in which it was very important in all countries. 30,000 soldiers trained in a year - as I told you - it is twice as much as we thought at first.

In the field of material support, the latest data we have indicate that the European Peace Fund, we have called on member countries to provide military equipment for the amount of 10 billion euros. The Fund we manage in Brussels will allocate 5.6 billion euros.

Therefore, we offered an eighth package another 500 million euros, which is being constructed. I hope that obstacles to its approval can be paid this week during discussions in technical committees. But today I do not have unanimous consent.In this way, we will be able to increase the capacity of the European Peace Fund for Ukraine. Of these 3.5 billion euros, about half will go to other cylinders. The number has not yet been determined. But they will not only concern Ukraine, the need for many other parts of the world.

The third dimension of our support is the supply of ammunition. You already know that 20 March we have agreed to allocate 2 billion euros for the provision of Ukrainian artillery ammunition, and we set ourselves to set it a million of shells in the next 12 months.

And for this we have designated three lanes or three lines of action - three tracks.

The first direction of action was to ask Member States to give us their courses. That they do not expect to produce more, but make their contributions that already have. And the last numbers are really much better than those that were 10 days ago. Because today I can announce that this first track of the Member States has put 220,000 artillery ammunition and 1300 missiles.

Since this first track will be open by May 31, I think we can be able to allocate the goals of 1 billion euros for this purpose, because what has already been given, we estimate it at 860 million euros.

The second area of action is to go together in joint purchases for European and Norwegian defense industry. Eight of the 24 countries that joined the project of the European Defense Agency confirmed to intend to receive 155 mm ammunition. The project will be to manage the project. In addition, there are two more projects: one is headed by France, Aisha - Germany. The EDA project [or member states that head it] can hold 1 billion euros for the purchase of ammunition of this particular caliber.

And further, the third direction, the third course of action is an increase in the production power of the European industry. The internal market commissioner, Mr Tierry Breton, explained to us that the European industry has the potential for the production of the necessary ammunition, and it depends on the co -law - the Council of Ukraine and the European Parliament - to approve the proposal of the European Commission. We hope to reach a whole million shells for Ukraine over the next 12 months.

The Council gathered the Leading Council of the European Defense Agency, which I am honored to lead, and we discussed the learned lessons or the consequences of this aggressive war in terms of our military potential and European proof priorities.I would like to add that in addition to the military dimension today, more than 1.5 billion euro of macro -financial assistance is sent to Ukraine to continue supporting the functioning of the Ukrainian state. And I take the opportunity to remind you that if we add all the elements of support-military, civilian, economic, humanitarian, financial support, help to refugees-if we add to the Abraile Ukraine from the European Union-and its Member States-undoubtedly supports the most. Ukraine. Because we have already exceeded the figure of 65 billion euro. This puts us in a truly relevant position of Ukraine's support, and we will do it.

We believe that Ukraine is protected effectively that it has made Putin's plans for a quick victory and we must continue to support her protection. Ukraine's support is not exhaustion and, conversely, show what we should do: give it the tools needed for effective protection, and do so as soon as possible and in the most appropriate quantities. Ukraine is a powerful support, and the defense ministers are determined to give it.

We also discussed the development of a strategic compass, ”Josepborrell said.
