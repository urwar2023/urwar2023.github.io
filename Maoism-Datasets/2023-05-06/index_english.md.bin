** _ on May 5 this year, according to the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine dated 24.12.2022 No. 333, in Ukraine will be celebrated for the first time the Day of Specialist and Military Cooperation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. About the path to this special activity of Simis correspondent Army _ ** ** _inform _ ** ** ** _Sear of the central administration

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-05T52-00-00-04-00/1-21.jpg)In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the decision to the pilot project from the CVS was made on May 5, 2014. His work was successfully started in the shortest possible time - a month later.

In the context of the Russian Federation, a hybrid warfare against Ukraine, civil-military cooperation has become an adequate response to novocardum. The need to establish interaction with civilian populations of state power, primarily in order to prevent obstruction(combat)actions, prompted to seek and embody a completely new in the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is based on the experience of NATO's armed forces. The CVS, in fact, became the first in the landscaping, formed according to the standards of the North Atlantic Alliance, which has been successfully performing the tasks for years in a row.

** _-If we turn to the experience of NATO member states, then the task is mostly in the territory of other states in international contingents, but we have war in our own territory ._ ** **

-Indeed, the main feature of the direction of civil-military cooperation of Ukraine is that they work in the territory of their state and the widespread forces and the population.

At the initial stage, for the main tasks and functions that the units of the Civil-Military Cooperation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been laid, the basic functions of NATO CVS were based on **: ** Organization of civilian-military interaction, support for troops(strength)and civilian objects, as well as relied on the experience of the United States Armed Forces. This fully corresponds to the challenges that have come to us.

An additional function, so to speak, is a national feature of search work and repatriation measures.

** _— You just told about the functions of the CVS, let us dwell on them ._ **

-One of the main functions of the CVA in the Armed Forces is civil-military interaction, which provides for appropriate work and communication with state authorities, international non-governmental organizations and public associations of civilians.

Support for troops(strength)It is a priority function for CVD units. It is also not necessary to forget about the importance of evaluating the state of civil environment and informing commanders on the ground. This enables qualitatively predictable negative factors that can significantly affect the task with the appointments of the Armed Forces.

In turn, supporting civil entities is to minimize the negative effects of hostilities on the civilian population. From the beginner -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the CVS units were faced with the need to provide humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilian populations(combat)actions and deoculated territories.

It is a sustainable and extremely important area of work. Therefore, the Humanitarian Project of the Armed Forces of Ukraine "Evacuation 200" was started and temporary groups on transportation of the Image of the fallen soldiers were created, which was further renamed the humanitarian Project "on the shield".

Currently, the CEC of the General Staff of the Armed Forces created the management of search work and repatriation measures. This is due to the pre -suggestation of the search for the search and repatriation of missing and lacer. This activity is carried out in cooperation with expert services, law enforcement agencies and other units of security and defense forces.

It should be noted separately that only in the Armed Forces there is such specificity of work for the units of civil-military cooperation.

**-the consequences of a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation have demonstrated that civil-military cooperation should be considered primarily as a common function of all units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. What has changed during this time? **

- With a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the priorities of the Tasks of the CVS in the launch have changed. The experience that the CVS has gained since February 24 last year is forcing some doctrinal documents and approaches to the tasks of the USS CVS. This is primarily due to the fact that, focusing on NATO standards, we adap them to use in the territory of our country, in the conditions of reflection of the Russian -scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.Our partners actively help us in the preparation of the personnel of the units of the CVS of the Armed Forces, which is constantly undergoing appropriate training both in Ukraine and abroad. Despite the fact that the war is ongoing, we will continue to study.

** - Thank you for such a meaningful conversation and on this occasion I congratulate you on your professional celebration!**

About it during a television marathon ["Unin"](https://www.youtube.com/live/WY8sDvZdWEA)The Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Anna Malyar told.

- Every rocket attack is perceived as something new and exclusive, because it is usually a loss and destruction. But if you look at the dynamics of action and war, no change in tactics is currently observed. The Russian Federation operates on the ability of its capabilities, adjusting the production of certain types of weapons. It is simply a course of war according to their current opportunities. Rocket shelling and drone attacks are checking the potential of our air defense.

Anna Malyar noted that the Russians are prone to symbolism. May 9 is their clause historical myth.

- For example, what do they do to take Bakhmut by May 9? Now we draw as they pull the Nabakhmut direction from the entire front line of the Wagner Front. Where there were units of Russian paratroopers, representatives of the Wagner PEC are thrown into their nursing. I must say that the propaganda is also lagging behind. Not only the official media of the Tategram-channels, but also the heads of these private groups have intensified. On the other hand, Ukraine's Deborons resist and do not allow defense. Active assault actions are also also giving up. We already have the news that our fighters destroy the storage of ammunition from the Wagnets.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-06T-128-16-00-03-00/630_360_1683371703-230.jpg)The coronation ceremony, which is currently involved in the King of the United Kingdom of Charles III and his wife, the Consorto Queen Camilla, is in a certain conclusion of the monarch's contract with the people of Great Britain and the public companion to stand on the guard of laws.

Such an explanation of the age tradition was given by the British journalist and writerin Kokrel-Fer in an interview [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hYreW-GnnM), reports Ukrinform.

“Coronation is the conclusion of the King of the Great [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-britania)contract with the people. He promises us that he will do everything to stand the laws of the United Kingdom and the Anglican Church, ”Kokrel -Fer said.

She drew attention to, she said, an interesting British paradox - Ukraine, which opened the world parliamentary democracy, has preserved such a most indomencratic type of government as a monarchy. "And not just kept it- he works," the writer emphasized.

In this context, she reminded that there was no such document as a constitution in the UK, but there are constitutional precedent acts.

"Without the monarch, all government acts are illegitimate, that is, in some ways the highest nosoar, which must give all legal legitimacy," Kokrel -Fhere said.

As an example, she cited the annual opening ceremony in the United Kingdom.

It is known that the United Kingdom is a unitary state and a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary management system. There is no Constitution in the form of a single document in the Great Britain. Traditions, legislative acts of parliament and judicial precedents are constitutional.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-pioneer-says-its-threat-world-may-be-more-urgent-than-climate-change-2023-05-05/)Jeffrey Hinton, widely known as one of the "baptized parents of an artificial office", recently announced that he had been released from Alphabet after decades of work in it, saying that he wanted to speak about the risks of chewing technology for his former employer.

Hinton's work is considered important for the development of modern systems [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stucnij-intelekt)In 1986, he is a challenge of the fundamental article "Learning representation by re -widening of errors", which became an important milestone in the development of neural networks, which are based on AI technology.

"I would not like to depreciate climate change. I would not like to say" You are innocent to worry about climate change. "This is also a huge risk. But I think it may be a more urgent problem, - says Hinton.

He added that in the event of climate change, it is very easy to give all the recommendations: just stop burn carbon. However, it is not clear to solve the possible risks associated with AI what it will be necessary to do.

According to Ukrinform, the adviser to the head of the Presidential Office Mikhailopodolyak said this on the air of the Tele scale "One News".

“Prigogine is not a monopolist today who has previously been a very important component of the military system to solve certain important issues in the third countries. Prigogine no longer receives budget financing, does not receive a resource because of the Ministry of Defense, ”Podolyak said.

According to him, Prigogine has no direct communications with the Kremlin, and the threat of his mercenaries from Bakhmut is only one of the manifestations of the internal war that began in Russia.

This was emphasized by the Minister of Health of Ukraine Viktor Lyashko during the EU Member States Ministers, which included the heads of different institutions of EU Member States in the field of health care.

“It is very important for Ukraine to support the EU countries, as it is the European region that is our key partners in response to the truthful aggression of Russia. Health care is one of the most affected by war and one of the most loaded. We will fix the growth of demand for various types of medical care and services. Today, there is no hospital in Ukrainian, which would not be affected by a Ukrainian who is affected by the war. Every sixth health care institution physically felt in its own stands, which means the so -called "precision weapons" of Russia. Attacks on health care facilities are only part of a wider picture of deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools, universities, water and power supply systems, transport, warehouses, food stocks and more. All these exit are consciously, including for the purpose of pressure and intimidation of peaceful order. In more than 400 days, the aggressor did not realize that nothing would make the Ukrainians retreat. Just as no gas, energy or political hammer forced you, European partners, to deviate from the help of Ukraine to put the concessions of the country that started this war. I am grateful that the level of humanitarian support for Ukraine remains high, and the political trip to the aggressor continues to grow, ”the health minister Lyashko emphasized, addressing his European colleagues.

The minister added that Russia's full -scale war against Ukraine has created critical reception on the national health care system. To date, over 1,400 facilities of medical institutions, 177 - destroyed. Also, from the beginning, Russia damaged 103 "fast", another 250 destroyed and captured 125, almost700 pharmacies were attacked. Many countries have already taken care of some of the Tazaclade regions. Currently, the process is coordinated and the implementation of ambitious plans.Representatives of the EU Member States have confirmed their complete and unquestionable support for Ukraine in the war with the aggressor, as well as expressed their readiness and gave the realization to support Ukraine and cooperate within the projects. It is about supporting refugees from Ukraine, integration of mechanists and simplification of conditions for work for them in some EU countries, providing humanitarian assistance, development of services in the field of physical tapsychological rehabilitation, participation in the reconstruction of destroyed or damaged infrastructure, medical evacuation of Ukrainians. .

The Ministry of Health is also actively working for the direction of technology into the European community. Self-screening is conducted, a table of more than 600 documents is developed in accordance with EU requirements. Our goal is to establish a transparent system where Ukraine will be able to become a complete component of the medical space of the European region on equal terms and will be able to report these conditions.

Підготовлена незалежною місією експертів Московського механізму ОБСЄ доповідьє першим окремим міжнародним звітом, присвяченим проблематиці незаконногопереміщення Росією українських дітей. Слід зазначити, що Російська Федераціявідмовилась співпрацювати із згаданою місією.

**Серед ключових висновків Звіту необхідно виділити, що:**

* велика кількість українських дітей, починаючи з 24 лютого 2022 року і раніше цієї дати, були переміщені на тимчасово окуповані території України та на територію російської федерації, що може кваліфікуватися як злочин проти людяності «депортація або примусове переміщення населення»;  * евакуація та тривале переміщення українських дітей без згоди є порушенням міжнародного гуманітарного права, а в окремих випадках — серйозними порушеннями IV Женевської конвенції та воєнними злочинами;  * примусово переміщені чи депортовані українські діти опиняються в суцільно російському середовищі, зокрема за мовою, звичаями та релігією, та піддаються проросійській інформаційній кампанії, яка часто зводиться до цілеспрямованого перевиховання та залучення до військової освіти;  * дії росії із зміни громадянства українських дітей, незаконне усиновлення дітей або подібні заходи з асиміляції є порушеннями IV Женевської конвенції;  * російська федерація створює різноманітні перепони для сімей, які прагнуть повернути своїх дітей, а також перешкоджає встановленню переліку та місцезнаходженню дітей, що є порушенням Женевських конвенцій;  * зафіксовано численні та повторювані порушення інтересів та прав дітей, передбачених Конвенцією ООН про права дитини, зокрема права на ідентичність, сім’ю та возз’єднання з сім’єю, освіту, доступ до інформації, відпочинок, дозвілля, свободу думки, совісті та релігії, права на свободу і недоторканність тощо;  * сукупні наслідки цих численних порушень викликають серйозні занепокоєння щодо того, що було порушено право переміщених українських дітей не піддаватися катуванням і жорстокому поводженню та іншим нелюдським або таким, що принижують гідність, видам поводження чи покарання.

The conclusions of the report can be used within the framework of national and international mechanisms of prosecution of customers and performers recorded in the report of crimes.

This year, he is already celebrated in the country. The decree states that this professional holiday is established "in order to honor the courage and heroism modern military traditions. "

Why are our infantry honors on May 6? After all, this day in 1648 the cosaks won the battle near the yellow waters. The battle is considered the first victorious - under the leadership of Bohdan Khmelnitsky. And on May 6, they celebrate the religious holiday - Yuri Zmieborets Day, who was one of the patrons of the Ukrainian army.

Our infantrymen, along with warriors of other families and types of troops since 2014, during the time -to -terrorist operation and operations of the Joint Forces courageously defended Ukraine.

Like last year, the day of infantry is now celebrated in the conditions of reflection of a wide -scale armed Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Under the pressure of our infantrymen in the spring of 2022, the enemy fled from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions.

Ukrainian infantry participated in a lightning counter -offensive in Kharkiv region.

And last November, the infantry soldiers, together with other families and Vidyamivsk, liberated the regional center of Ukraine-the city of Kherson.

And for this, thousands of soldiers were awarded state awards.

Today, Ukrainian infantrymen are ready to liberate other territories of our state.

In the current difficult environment, the personnel of the mechanized and motor infantry units demonstrates the loyalty of the military oath and high responsibility.

And firing power and high mobility are something that allows modern infantrymen to destroy Russian invaders on the battlefield.

The Armyinform joins the greetings and wishes our infantry new victories!

Answering the presenter's questions about whether the forces were beaten by the defense "dagger" a few days ago, or not, a spokesman for the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuri Ignat on the air [television marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The only news emphasized that the information should be announced by the Commander of the Air Force or other non -existence. After all, providing prompt information is the help of the enemy. At the same time, he commented that we have now had a weapon that can work for such purposes.

- The work of _patrio systems in Ukraine - this is the history of the whole world. We know how much western media have already illustrated and showed it. Yes, we have weapons opposite ballistics. But no one knows in practice whether _patriot_ can work. Of course, it is stated for certain purposes. But to practice the practice, no. A week ago, the Air Force commander published a dwarf where he, together with the calculation of _patriot **** _ said the following words: "Well, you need to try? We need to try!Together to victory, guys. " He shook his hands and went to work on his business. And the boys began to do their work.

I want to say that _patriot_ is generally a unique complex, extremely powerful. It can also work for ballistic purposes. Maybe somewhere out of place, but there in one installation can be placed in 4 mines of rockets of different types, which will work for various purposes. Because there is no need to use a rocket against ballistics in order to knock down the aerodynamic target. This is the uniqueness of this complex. Well, we have such azom. Unfortunately, there are few, - said Yuri Ignat.

He also stressed that information that and when air force is not immediately reported, without official confirmation of air units.

During an interview with Dmitry Komarov, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov reported that Russia's military leadership hid the real loss of his army at the beginning of the invasion of the territory of Ukraine.

- I was amazed by the cynicality of the Russians. On the day we were in the negotiations of Ubilorus, we even counted 3,000 Russians killed. These are Gostomel, other cities. Our side suggested that their delegations take away the bodies of killed by the soldiers, - said Alexei Reznikov. - The head of the Russian delegation returns to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia, and he says that they do not confirm this information. According to them, they killed several hundred people.

They cynically hid the losses from their leadership. They were afraid to convey this information to the highest leadership of Russia.

- This phrase that they do not throw their own, does not correspond to any reality, - summed up the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

- We used the system "Eyes". This is such a born project from the moment of the refinement of Kyiv region, the liberation of Kharkiv region. Currently, we have thousands of operators of different types of drones from small to large. We constantly keep online observations. All units, commands see the picture. Thanks to these eyes, we were dominating in the air, and our boys were moving forward, - Oleksiyreznikov said.

He stressed that in turn the Russians were afraid to report on the loss of the territory. They could keep it secret for several days. Therefore, when their commanders, who reported for logistics, thought they were in the rear 50-60 kilometers from the front line, and their Ukrainian military was surrounded by the Ukrainian military. They were shocked that the Ukrainian army can already be here. Proper competent planning with the use of all forces and means, situational identity gives preference.

- It is very important to develop the Ukrainian UAV sector. It is necessary to be independent from China, from other states. You need to have your own, independent UAV sector. It will be situational awareness and advantage, ”said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

Today, the commander of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Mykola Oleshchuk has officially confirmed that the Ukrainian air defense for the first time in history has shot down the Russian aerobalist practitioner "dagger". It happened during a night attack on May 4 in the sky of Kyiv region. The X-47 lady released the MiG-31K from the territory of Russia.

Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignati on the air of the Telehorphone "One News" [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5TqaWCCdUg)About the features of the rocket opened the details of the beating of the Russian rocket.

-On May 4, at about second o'clock in the morning, the enemy Mig-31K rose from the Savaslaka airfield and from there, in fact, made a start. The Center Air Command, which takes care of the Kyiv region, accompanied this goal. And the goal, in fact, was worked out by the Patriot Division, which is capable of knocking down ballistic routes, - Yuri Ignat informed.

He added that about it today [reported](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/05/06/komanduvach-povitryanyh-syl-pidtverdyv-shho-ukrayina-vpershe-zbyla-rosijsku-raketu-kyndzhal/)In his telegram-channel, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk commander.

The Air Force spokesman also noted that Ukraine needs as much as possible as possibleparatrio, as Russia is the threat of such rockets throughout Ukraine, especially in the eastern direction. But the decision to transfer them is made by international partners.

- The eastern direction is one of the most important, because attacks are occurring, but also the capital of Ukraine is the number one target for the enemy. It is most commonly attacked by Kiev, where all the bodies of our management, power and many infrastructure sites are located, - said Yuri Ignat.

At the same time, he recalled that Ukraine is also expecting SAMP/T and others, which will appear on the next time.

- We expect samp/t, we also expect other Patriot divisions and we will enhance the prototype defense. The most necessary now is what can protect our sky only from ballistic missiles, but also from enemy aviation. We know that there is a serious threat in Russia's use of aviation. That is why we have to get in this direction in this direction to drive away Russian aviation away, - said Yuri Ignat.

He noted once again that the knocking down is a good news.

- Of course, there, behind Parebrik, is burning, but it is not burning for sure the first day, because it is actually such a slap of Russia, - said Yuri Ignat.- Our air forces are grateful to our partners who give us such weapons. It did not believe that Patriot could be in Ukraine so quickly. It may have been ashamed earlier, but as partners could be provided. We want partners to see this weapon at work. We have already shown some videos, showing the world that everything works successfully, - said Yuri Ignat.

“Dear warriors, infantrymen!

Today we celebrate our professional holiday!

It is a holiday of steel and courageous men. Infantry is about endurance, courage, courage and heroism. And about character - it is the basis of stability.

As Karl Clausewitz wrote, the concept of "power of character" is about the firmness of beliefs. It is indifferent whether the latter are the conclusions of a foreign or own system of views, whether they arise from the principles, norms, instant impressions and any other manifestations of the mind.

Infantrymen - always where it is difficult!

In recent years of the war, you have shown that even in the most difficult situations, it is possible to break the course of events in your own benefit. And even where the enemy is numerically, it is possible to conquer the Ukrainian land.

Successful counter -offensive operations have become possible due to the clear discipline of infantry.

Today, the holiday is not only the Land Forces, but also the defenders of the territorial defense, landing troops, the Marines and all who hold the front line, where heavy fights are going on.

Eternal honor to fallen heroes who gave their lives in the fight against Pidlagressor. Glory to all who continue to fight and fearlessly destroys enemies.

I am convinced that in the near future Ukrainian infantry will lift the Ukrainian label above Deoocupovan Donetsk, Lugansk and in the Crimea.

Happy infantry, our dear defenders and defenders of Ukraine!

Glory to Ukraine!".

In addition, it is important to prepare a childhood from childhood, - Oleksireznikov said in an interview. - I believe that we do not need a fixed service, but there should be a better approach, perhaps an analogue of the Swiss reservist variant.

He also added that after the victory of Ukraine, it is obligatory to take place in the Nonurnberg-2, where the Russian killers will be tried.

-There must be an international court where Russian criminals, their military-political leadership should be on the defendants and obtain their sentences.

“She had a pleasant and important meeting with a special representative of the NATO General Secretary of Women, Peace and Security Irene Fellin.

The meeting is obliged to write in a dry official language. Standard phrases such as "the parties discussed important issues", "The meeting has passed the handset" and so on.

Now I will start picking up words to convey the real atmosphere of the meeting and not to raise the protocol.

The meeting was emotional and frank. Irene Fellin is very well aware of our war and sincerely ill for the fate of Ukraine and Ukrainians.

Irene has heard my speech at an international event in Portugal on the problems of women of icholovik in the Armed Forces, which arose from a full -scale war, and now wanted to talk about it in more detail.

Yes, there are things that can only be discussed in such a personal meeting format.

Irene Fellin is grateful for indifference and active position. "
