-Indeed, the main feature of the direction of civil-military cooperation of Ukraine is that they work in the territory of their state and the widespread forces and the population.

— You just told about the functions of the CVS, let us dwell on them . 
-One of the main functions of the CVA in the Armed Forces is civil-military interaction, which provides for appropriate work and communication with state authorities, international non-governmental organizations and public associations of civilians.
Support for troops(strength)It is a priority function for CVD units. It is also not necessary to forget about the importance of evaluating the state of civil environment and informing commanders on the ground. This enables qualitatively predictable negative factors that can significantly affect the task with the appointments of the Armed Forces.
In turn, supporting civil entities is to minimize the negative effects of hostilities on the civilian population. From the beginner -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the CVS units were faced with the need to provide humanitarian aid and evacuation of civilian populations(combat)actions and deoculated territories.

Therefore, the Humanitarian Project of the Armed Forces of Ukraine "Evacuation 200" was started and temporary groups on transportation of the Image of the fallen soldiers were created, which was further renamed the humanitarian Project "on the shield".
Currently, the CEC of the General Staff of the Armed Forces created the management of search work and repatriation measures. This is due to the pre -suggestation of the search for the search and repatriation of missing and lacer. This activity is carried out in cooperation with expert services, law enforcement agencies and other units of security and defense forces.
It should be noted separately that only in the Armed Forces there is such specificity of work for the units of civil-military cooperation.

In this context, she reminded that there was no such document as a constitution in the UK, but there are constitutional precedent acts.
"Without the monarch, all government acts are illegitimate, that is, in some ways the highest nosoar, which must give all legal legitimacy," Kokrel -Fhere said.

Health care is one of the most affected by war and one of the most loaded. We will fix the growth of demand for various types of medical care and services. Today, there is no hospital in Ukrainian, which would not be affected by a Ukrainian who is affected by the war. Every sixth health care institution physically felt in its own stands, which means the so -called "precision weapons" of Russia. Attacks on health care facilities are only part of a wider picture of deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools, universities, water and power supply systems, transport, warehouses, food stocks and more. All these exit are consciously, including for the purpose of pressure and intimidation of peaceful order. In more than 400 days, the aggressor did not realize that nothing would make the Ukrainians retreat. Just as no gas, energy or political hammer forced you, European partners, to deviate from the help of Ukraine to put the concessions of the country that started this war. I am grateful that the level of humanitarian support for Ukraine remains high, and the political trip to the aggressor continues to grow, ”the health minister Lyashko emphasized, addressing his European colleagues.

Also, from the beginning, Russia damaged 103 "fast", another 250 destroyed and captured 125, almost700 pharmacies were attacked. Many countries have already taken care of some of the Tazaclade regions. Currently, the process is coordinated and the implementation of ambitious plans.Representatives of the EU Member States have confirmed their complete and unquestionable support for Ukraine in the war with the aggressor, as well as expressed their readiness and gave the realization to support Ukraine and cooperate within the projects.

The battle is considered the first victorious - under the leadership of Bohdan Khmelnitsky. And on May 6, they celebrate the religious holiday - Yuri Zmieborets Day, who was one of the patrons of the Ukrainian army.
Our infantrymen, along with warriors of other families and types of troops since 2014, during the time -to -terrorist operation and operations of the Joint Forces courageously defended Ukraine.
Like last year, the day of infantry is now celebrated in the conditions of reflection of a wide -scale armed Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Under the pressure of our infantrymen in the spring of 2022, the enemy fled from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions.
Ukrainian infantry participated in a lightning counter -offensive in Kharkiv region.
And last November, the infantry soldiers, together with other families and Vidyamivsk, liberated the regional center of Ukraine-the city of Kherson.
And for this, thousands of soldiers were awarded state awards.
Today, Ukrainian infantrymen are ready to liberate other territories of our state.
In the current difficult environment, the personnel of the mechanized and motor infantry units demonstrates the loyalty of the military oath and high responsibility.
And firing power and high mobility are something that allows modern infantrymen to destroy Russian invaders on the battlefield.
The Armyinform joins the greetings and wishes our infantry new victories!

Maybe somewhere out of place, but there in one installation can be placed in 4 mines of rockets of different types, which will work for various purposes.

They were shocked that the Ukrainian army can already be here. Proper competent planning with the use of all forces and means, situational identity gives preference.

“Dear warriors, infantrymen!
Today we celebrate our professional holiday!
It is a holiday of steel and courageous men. Infantry is about endurance, courage, courage and heroism. And about character - it is the basis of stability.
As Karl Clausewitz wrote, the concept of "power of character" is about the firmness of beliefs. It is indifferent whether the latter are the conclusions of a foreign or own system of views, whether they arise from the principles, norms, instant impressions and any other manifestations of the mind.
Infantrymen - always where it is difficult!
In recent years of the war, you have shown that even in the most difficult situations, it is possible to break the course of events in your own benefit. And even where the enemy is numerically, it is possible to conquer the Ukrainian land.
Successful counter -offensive operations have become possible due to the clear discipline of infantry.
Today, the holiday is not only the Land Forces, but also the defenders of the territorial defense, landing troops, the Marines and all who hold the front line, where heavy fights are going on.
Eternal honor to fallen heroes who gave their lives in the fight against Pidlagressor. Glory to all who continue to fight and fearlessly destroys enemies.
I am convinced that in the near future Ukrainian infantry will lift the Ukrainian label above Deoocupovan Donetsk, Lugansk and in the Crimea.
Happy infantry, our dear defenders and defenders of Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!".

 The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar reported On Facebook:
“She had a pleasant and important meeting with a special representative of the NATO General Secretary of Women, Peace and Security Irene Fellin.
The meeting is obliged to write in a dry official language. Standard phrases such as "the parties discussed important issues", "The meeting has passed the handset" and so on.
Now I will start picking up words to convey the real atmosphere of the meeting and not to raise the protocol.
The meeting was emotional and frank. Irene Fellin is very well aware of our war and sincerely ill for the fate of Ukraine and Ukrainians.
Irene has heard my speech at an international event in Portugal on the problems of women of icholovik in the Armed Forces, which arose from a full -scale war, and now wanted to talk about it in more detail.
Yes, there are things that can only be discussed in such a personal meeting format.
Irene Fellin is grateful for indifference and active position. "
