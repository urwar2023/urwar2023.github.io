When international organizations that should protect life on a global scale, even a week do not have time to form and send a rescue mission to a nailed territory when some world entities do not dare to get out even with clear and strong statements that would condemn this next Russian war, terrorists simply terrorists They are fueled by this weakness of the world, with this carelessness - it encourages them. And we have to overcome it. And we will overcome.
We click and encourage that international organizations, international support in the part of Kherson, where occupiers are now.
As of this time, more than 3,000 people have already been eachamed in the Kherson and Mykolaiv region. But again, it is only free-controlled, controlled by us.All this should be a separate fair and rigid responsibility of the Russian state and the Russian leadership.
And international organizations must work where we have not yet deduced our territories. Every life is important - all of Kherson, all south. Every city is Yelselo. We will do our best and impossible to help all people.
I thank each of our rescuer, military and police, local communities and international organizations that are currently operating in the Kherson region of Tamikolaevshchina, all our volunteers - everyone who helps to save the catastrophe zone and animals, animals and life in general ... and tell the world of the people who suffered.

“It happens - and with journalists especially - when life puts a preying choice: to become a hero? It happens that it is much easier to bypass such a selection and stay somewhere in the gray area between good and evil - in the zinosajuneutrality. But anyone who does not bypass him and confronts evil, who who misses things by his name and spreads the truth - can be a hero not only for a day. We live at a time when our freedom depends on all of us, when the world has to know the full truth about every crime against freedom in one world so that freedom is preserved everywhere.

 Latvia has said to consider a request for asylum, submitted by the director with the RFSSKIPICIN.
As Ukrinform reports, it reports Delfi .
Earlier, Dilipitsin stated that he did not support the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and express the readiness to integrate into Latvian society.
Now France has a shelter for the Russian director.
In the public decision of the administrative district court of June 1 it is assumed that a citizen RF He entered the EU Stone through Estonia on August 30, 2022. He had a Russian passport and a Schengen category "C" visa issued by France, the validity of June 2, 2022 to June 1, 2023.
The court's verdict does not indicate the name of the person, but the LETA agency found out about the theater director Sergiy Pititsyn from St. Petersburg, which is being placed in Latvian and Russian theaters.
On November 15, 2022, Plipitsyn appealed to the State Border Border with a statement of a refugee status or alternative status in Latvia. In April this year, the Latvian Citizenship and Migration Directorate(PMLP)Approval of the transfer of a man's request to France. The decision was made by the regulation of the European Parliament.
Disagreeing with the decision of the administration, the Russian appealed to the district administrative court. He claimed in court that he did not have a Russian passport because he was left in the State Border Service. And instead of a passport he was given a certificate of a person who seeks asylum in Latvia.
Sergey Pmipitsin disagreed with the PMLP decision also because it has the ability to work in Latvia. He is a director, earlier worked in Latvian theater: in 2009 - in Riga, in 2017 - in Valmierre, in 2019 - Uliepai. And on May 18 this year, the premiere of the play "Rebellion" took place at the Cesizian Theater. In the Cesesky Theater they want to continue cooperation with the director.
In addition, Plipicin is currently negotiating with the Joriks research Theater, and Deu September this year envisages a new performance. In addition, there are intervals with representatives of the Riga Russian Theater named after M. Chekhov, as well as the Zlyypay and Valmiere theaters.
Dilipicin states that he is where to live in Latvia, he studies Latvian and the Tagotok language to pass the state language.According to the director, he cannot return to the Russian Federation for political reasons because he does not support Moscow's war against Ukraine. That is why the applicant left the Russian Federation on August 29, 2022.
Another reason why the director cannot return to the Russian Federation is specific professional activity. According to Prypitsyn, in the Russian Federation he will not be able to realize in his profession, since the authorities will persecute it, he will not have the cost of existence, perhaps he may find repression or imprisonment.
Despite the evidence of the applicant, the Latvian court rejected the statement of the Russian theater register to cancel the PMLP decision.
The court noted that France, as a member of the EU, is generally able to protect human rights in its territory: France is considered a safe country and can be possible political asylum. It follows from the case file that the PMLP received a response from a competent French body that assumed a responsibility for consideration of the applicant's request for asylum.

“It happens - and with journalists especially - when life puts a preying choice: to become a hero? It happens that it is much easier to bypass such a selection and stay somewhere in the gray area between good and evil - in the zinosajuneutrality. But anyone who does not bypass him and confronts evil, who who misses things by his name and spreads the truth - can be a hero not only for a day. We live at a time when our freedom depends on all of us, when the world has to know the full truth about every crime against freedom in one world so that freedom is preserved everywhere. Evil now claims not only the country or another country, but on values. Our values with you. To be cut. And I thank you - and all Canada "For you are not kidding with evil," Zelensky said.
The head of the Ukrainian state thanked for the support of our struggle for freedom. "Thank you for telling the world about every military crime of Russia. I see you for giving people understanding what is happening!"

Again and again we thank our people: military, police officers, rescuers. I thank separately to volunteers, doctors, local authorities - to anyone who helps to infect people after a catastrophe at the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant, and especially thanks to those who help to get people, in particular, from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult, dangerous, it is a special heroism. Thank you for every saved life!
Russian terrorists continue to fire evacuation routes, punctures, boats on which people are taken out ... Today, three people were killed as a result of one of the same. It was an evacuation from Kardashinka, villages on the Left Bank of Kherson region ... The invaders created this disaster, undermined the Swing, threw people in the flooded cities and villages, and they still set up boats after which people try to take away ... even more innicated than you, the Russian state.
Representatives of the International Criminal Court visited the Kherson region these days. The first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a corresponding appeal to the Office of the International Criminal Court to the Office of the International Criminal Court to investigate this disaster, and the work has already begun.The full and fair responsibility of Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite that there will be no more repetition of such evil in the world.
Today, our state has taken another sanctional step. Against those who will serve the evil that the Russian state became. Against those who have helped to destroy the diligence in Russia and play one of the key roles in repression by natively occupied our territory and in the territory of Russia itself. 178 of the samists were added to our sanctions lists on the submission of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do our best and every one of this list of assistants of the Russian dictatorship is true of everything they had done against people and freedom. For every broken fate and for every criminal decision, which helps to turn into a terrorist state.
And one more. Of course, I am grateful to our soldiers for this day. Each of our battle, each of our division. Khortytsya, Tavriya, all who are contagious, all who are in positions, everyone who helps ... I thank you!Thank you for every book, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!

Canada imposes additional sanctions against 24 physical and 17 organizations in Ukraine within the framework of the Regulations on Special Economic Measures(Ukraine) . Price measures are a direct answer to Russia's attempts to destroy cultural objects, institutions and identity of Ukraine.
About it reports The Canadian Government site.
In addition to significant damage and complete destruction of a number of Ukrainian cultural objects, thousands of Ukrainian cultural artifacts were found missing or, as reported, stolen by Russian troops in temporary -occupied territories after a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine in 2022 year. In its efforts, the identity of Ukraine, Russia, is reported that illegally exported Ukraine and caused harm to cultural heritage objects.
“With today's announcement, Canada imposes sanctions against persons associated with Russian cultural objects by Russia to resist Kreml's attempts to“ Russify ”Ukrainian culture. There are Ukrainians who work in museums and other cultural centers in the list of persons who have been submitted to the sub -centers. It also includes the newly created structures of the occupied territories of Ukraine, such as the so -called ministries of education, as well as natural and legal persons related to private military companies that have arisen in Ukraine and fight on the side of Russia, ”the message goes.
In addition, since Russia is trying to force its culture and the education of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, these sanctions will lead to further expenditure on the so -called power in the regions of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian Russian military in order to protect Ukrainian culture and identity.
With these sanctions, Canada confirms its unwavering devotion to the support of the people against the aggressive war of Russia, continuing to increase the pressure on Russia, who cooperate with the Russian administration in Ukraine as they stop these unjustified attacks.

The first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a corresponding appeal to the Office of the International Criminal Court to the Office of the International Criminal Court to investigate this disaster, and the work has already begun.The full and fair responsibility of Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite that there will be no more repetition of such evil in the world.
Today, our state has taken another sanctional step. Against those who will serve the evil that the Russian state became. Against those who have helped to destroy the diligence in Russia and play one of the key roles in repression by natively occupied our territory and in the territory of Russia itself. 178 of the samists were added to our sanctions lists on the submission of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do our best and every one of this list of assistants of the Russian dictatorship is true of everything they had done against people and freedom. For every broken fate and for every criminal decision, which helps to turn into a terrorist state.
And one more. Of course, I am grateful to our soldiers for this day. Each of our battle, each of our division. Khortytsya, Tavriya - all who are contagious, all who are in positions, everyone who helps ... I thank you!Thank you for every book, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!
Glory to our heroes!Glory to all who protect the life of Ukraine and Ukrainians!
We will win!
