<p>About it <a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/krymskyi-bloher-kolaborant-u-svoiemu-dopysi-prohovoryvsia-pro-pidhotovku-rosiianamy-pidryvu-kakhovskoi-hes.html">reports</a>MOV Intelligence Directorate.</p>
<p>In particular, Talipov was indignant with the posts of so -called Russian military bloggers who reported that the personnel of the invaders were thrown on the islands and they were "not on trees on trees". In fact, as Talipov explained, this is a fake: “I contacted our boys. Everyone came out of the islands. At the third night there was no one. There are no losses. Therefore, all the information that is published in this keys is a brazen lie. "</p>
<p>This is a direct evidence that the Russian military knew about the future terrorist attack pasuvatly declared evacuation.</p>
<p>There is a high likelihood that after the wide publicity of this information, they will try to declare the "enemy of the people" or "agent of the Ukrainian Special services". However, the number of such evidence is increasing. They will all become an additional evidence in the future tribunal.</p>

<p>This was emphasized in an interview with Ukrinform by infectious disease doctor Yevgeny Dubrovsky.</p>
<p>“We all know about the total morta of fish, especially in the territories where the water is frozen - the fish remained there and died.

<p>This was emphasized in an interview with Ukrinform by infectious disease doctor Yevgeny Dubrovsky.</p>
<p>He recalled that leptospirosis is a dangerous disease, a source of contamination of any rodents: mice, rats, rats, etc. However, infection requires several conditions: standing water in which a rodent lives, and a person who causes this water should have damage to the skin - scratches, cuts.</p>
<p>"If you look critically at all these conditions, then it is really possible, especially with rescuers who get people from hard -to -reach places. It is just a private sector where water can be infected - some standing places, smooth, bay . And rescuers, of course, have scratches, injuries, because their work is difficult and dangerous, they may become infected, " - said the expert.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, GeoconfirMed - the GEOCONFIRMED - the global geolocation platform, focused on the war in Ukraine, which is quoted [Stratko of the Armed Forces] in its analysis.(https://t.me/AFUStratCom/18387).</p>
<p>As stated in the message <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1667309514654195714?t=OMVTdgbcVgj_4SYqzlqcMQ&amp;s=19">GeoconfirMed</a>, for the third night in a row, Russian chats are spreading about the restoration of the offensive of Ukrainians at night in the Zaporozhye direction.</p>
<p>However, the platform notes, "almost all footage spread Russian sources that are, of course, focused on Ukrainian losses. Most losses have been a few days or some are already known losses, demonstrated from a different point It was tempted. Where the audience see one damaged car, they were more and who were not injured ... ".</p>
<p>The report also states that on June 10, Ukraine has published several quadrans from both southern directions: in the last 3 days, Ukraine has been able to destroy the two tons-1A, one in the Great Novosilka and one in the Bakhmut direction. There was no more than this war. It helps to determine that Ukrainians are tingling about OPPEC(Publication of materials in view of the safety of military operations), but those infrequent footage that have been published show that "something is happening."</p>
<p>Regarding the number of geoconfirMed destroyed cars, Ukraine has more than a thousand units for new units for new Brigades.</p>
<p>This is a war against echelorated defense. The Armed Forces will lose a lot of equipment. It is a part of the state. The numbers that the Russians show, nothing compared to volumes(techniques -ed.)What Ukraine has an offensive for this.</p>
<p>Analysts also point out that "most destroyed vehicles are most likely destroyed by mines. The naked eye shows that the hatches are open, there is no blood, therefore there were no machines. To replace, people are not.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/latviya-otkazalas-rassmatrivat-proshenie-rossijskogo-rezhissera-o-predostavlenii-ubezhischa.d?id=55651092">Delfi</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier, Dilipitsin stated that he did not support the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and express the readiness to integrate into Latvian society.</p>
<p>Now France has a shelter for the Russian director.</p>
<p>In the public decision of the administrative district court of June 1 it is assumed that a citizen <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia">RF</a>He entered the EU Stone through Estonia on August 30, 2022. He had a Russian passport and a Schengen category "C" visa issued by France, the validity of June 2, 2022 to June 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The court's verdict does not indicate the name of the person, but the LETA agency found out about the theater director Sergiy Pititsyn from St. Petersburg, which is being placed in Latvian and Russian theaters.</p>
<p>On November 15, 2022, Plipitsyn appealed to the State Border Border with a statement of a refugee status or alternative status in Latvia. In April this year, the Latvian Citizenship and Migration Directorate(PMLP)Approval of the transfer of a man's request to France. The decision was made by the regulation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Disagreeing with the decision of the administration, the Russian appealed to the district administrative court. He claimed in court that he did not have a Russian passport because he was left in the State Border Service. And instead of a passport he was given a certificate of a person who seeks asylum in Latvia.</p>
<p>Sergey Pmipitsin disagreed with the PMLP decision also because it has the ability to work in Latvia. He is a director, earlier worked in Latvian theater: in 2009 - in Riga, in 2017 - in Valmierre, in 2019 - Uliepai. And on May 18 this year, the premiere of the play "Rebellion" took place at the Cesizian Theater. In the Cesesky Theater they want to continue cooperation with the director.</p>
<p>In addition, Plipicin is currently negotiating with the Joriks research Theater, and Deu September this year envisages a new performance. In addition, there are intervals with representatives of the Riga Russian Theater named after M. Chekhov, as well as the Zlyypay and Valmiere theaters.</p>
<p>Dilipicin states that he is where to live in Latvia, he studies Latvian and the Tagotok language to pass the state language.According to the director, he cannot return to the Russian Federation for political reasons because he does not support Moscow's war against Ukraine. That is why the applicant left the Russian Federation on August 29, 2022.</p>
<p>Another reason why the director cannot return to the Russian Federation is specific professional activity. According to Prypitsyn, in the Russian Federation he will not be able to realize in his profession, since the authorities will persecute it, he will not have the cost of existence, perhaps he may find repression or imprisonment.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence of the applicant, the Latvian court rejected the statement of the Russian theater register to cancel the PMLP decision.</p>
<p>The court noted that France, as a member of the EU, is generally able to protect human rights in its territory: France is considered a safe country and can be possible political asylum. It follows from the case file that the PMLP received a response from a competent French body that assumed a responsibility for consideration of the applicant's request for asylum.</p>

<p>After meeting with Tunisia President, Kaisa Sayed in the capital of the country, von Derlyen announced that they will work together on a "pentalist pack", which includes "Increasing Trade and Investment" and "mutually beneficial energy cooperation".</p>

We live at a time when our freedom depends on all of us, when the world has to know the full truth about every crime against freedom in one world so that freedom is preserved everywhere. Evil now claims not only the country or another country, but on values. Our values with you. To be cut.

<p>_ <strong> Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>Today, 95 more of our people were returned from Russian captivity, 31 of them were Mariupol's defender. Most are ordinary and sergeants, two officers. Arms, National Guard, border guards. I thank our team: Budanov, Yermak, baby, lubin, who is engaged in exchanges, thank you for this result. Well done guys!Every Ukrainian, we have to pull every Ukrainian from Russian.</p>
<p>We continue our rescue operation in the south of Ukraine, and about 4 thousand people have been evacuated. Dozens of cities and villages remain flooded, the worst situation, as before, on a temporarily occupied part of Kherson region.</p>
<p>Again and again we thank our people: military, police officers, rescuers. I thank separately to volunteers, doctors, local authorities - to anyone who helps to infect people after a catastrophe at the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant, and especially thanks to those who help to get people, in particular, from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult, dangerous, it is a special heroism. Thank you for every saved life!</p>
<p>Russian terrorists continue to fire evacuation routes, punctures, boats on which people are taken out ... Today, three people were killed as a result of one of the same. It was an evacuation from Kardashinka, villages on the Left Bank of Kherson region ... The invaders created this disaster, undermined the Swing, threw people in the flooded cities and villages, and they still set up boats after which people try to take away ... even more innicated than you, the Russian state.</p>
<p>Representatives of the International Criminal Court visited the Kherson region these days. The first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a corresponding appeal to the Office of the International Criminal Court to the Office of the International Criminal Court to investigate this disaster, and the work has already begun.The full and fair responsibility of Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite that there will be no more repetition of such evil in the world.</p>
<p>Today, our state has taken another sanctional step. Against those who will serve the evil that the Russian state became. Against those who have helped to destroy the diligence in Russia and play one of the key roles in repression by natively occupied our territory and in the territory of Russia itself. 178 of the samists were added to our sanctions lists on the submission of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do our best and every one of this list of assistants of the Russian dictatorship is true of everything they had done against people and freedom. For every broken fate and for every criminal decision, which helps to turn into a terrorist state.</p>
<p>And one more. Of course, I am grateful to our soldiers for this day. Each of our battle, each of our division. Khortytsya, Tavriya, all who are contagious, all who are in positions, everyone who helps ... I thank you!Thank you for every book, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!</p>
<p>Glory to our heroes!Glory to all who protect the life of Ukraine and Ukrainians!</p>

<p>_ <strong> Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>Today, 95 more of our people were returned from Russian captivity, 31 of them were Mariupol's defender. Most are ordinary and sergeants, two officers. Arms, National Guard, border guards. I thank our team: Budanov, Yermak, baby, lubin, who is engaged in exchanges, thank you for this result. Well done guys!Every Ukrainian, we have to pull every Ukrainian from Russian.</p>
<p>We continue our rescue operation in the south of Ukraine, and about 4 thousand people have been evacuated. Dozens of cities and villages remain flooded, the worst situation, as before, on a temporarily occupied part of Kherson region.</p>
<p>Again and again we thank our people: military, police officers, rescuers. I thank separately to volunteers, doctors, local authorities - to anyone who helps to infect people after a catastrophe at the Kakhovskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant, and especially thanks to those who help to get people, in particular, from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult, dangerous, it is a special heroism. Thank you for every saved life!</p>
<p>Russian terrorists continue to fire evacuation routes, punctures, boats on which people are taken out ... Today, three people were killed as a result of one of the same. It was an evacuation from Kardashinka, villages on the Left Bank of Kherson region ... The invaders created this disaster, undermined the Swing, threw people in the flooded cities and villages, and they still set up boats after which people try to take away ... even more innicated than you, the Russian state.</p>
<p>Representatives of the International Criminal Court visited the Kherson region these days. The first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a corresponding appeal to the Office of the International Criminal Court to the Office of the International Criminal Court to investigate this disaster, and the work has already begun.The full and fair responsibility of Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite that there will be no more repetition of such evil in the world.</p>
<p>Today, our state has taken another sanctional step. Against those who will serve the evil that the Russian state became. Against those who have helped to destroy the diligence in Russia and play one of the key roles in repression by natively occupied our territory and in the territory of Russia itself. 178 of the samists were added to our sanctions lists on the submission of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do our best and every one of this list of assistants of the Russian dictatorship is true of everything they had done against people and freedom. For every broken fate and for every criminal decision, which helps to turn into a terrorist state.</p>
<p>And one more. Of course, I am grateful to our soldiers for this day. Each of our battle, each of our division. Khortytsya, Tavriya, all who are contagious, all who are in positions, everyone who helps ... I thank you!Thank you for every book, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!</p>

They are easily hidden in a firing position, and the pace of firing about 600 shots of the rockwill allows you to reliably hit the air targets at great distances. The union with the thermal imaging sight and the collimator target is a very powerful weapon against the Shahaneda.</p>
<p>This was announced during the tactical-special classes at one of the landfills of the northern operating zone, the commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Lieutenant General Sergey Naev.</p>
<ul>
<li>The main task of Viktor installations is to fight striking unmanned pilots, as well as to counteract aircraft and helicopters on small high percentages. Front-armed equipment, field fortifications of the enemy and its infantry are also quite achievable targets for a paired 14.5 mm of anti-aircraft machine gun installed on the Toyota Land Cruiser 70 chassis,-emphasized Lenanthentantgiy Nayev.</li>

<p>Canada imposes additional sanctions against 24 physical and 17 organizations in Ukraine within the framework of the Regulations on Special <em>Economic Measures(Ukraine)</em>. Price measures are a direct answer to Russia's attempts to destroy cultural objects, institutions and identity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2023/06/minister-joly-announces-additional-sanctions-to-protect-ukrainian-culture-from-destruction-by-russia.html">reports</a>The Canadian Government site.</p>
<p>In addition to significant damage and complete destruction of a number of Ukrainian cultural objects, thousands of Ukrainian cultural artifacts were found missing or, as reported, stolen by Russian troops in temporary -occupied territories after a full -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine in 2022 year. In its efforts, the identity of Ukraine, Russia, is reported that illegally exported Ukraine and caused harm to cultural heritage objects.</p>
<p>“With today's announcement, Canada imposes sanctions against persons associated with Russian cultural objects by Russia to resist Kreml's attempts to“ Russify ”Ukrainian culture. There are Ukrainians who work in museums and other cultural centers in the list of persons who have been submitted to the sub -centers. It also includes the newly created structures of the occupied territories of Ukraine, such as the so -called ministries of education, as well as natural and legal persons related to private military companies that have arisen in Ukraine and fight on the side of Russia, ”the message goes.</p>
<p>In addition, since Russia is trying to force its culture and the education of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, these sanctions will lead to further expenditure on the so -called power in the regions of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian Russian military in order to protect Ukrainian culture and identity.</p>
<p>With these sanctions, Canada confirms its unwavering devotion to the support of the people against the aggressive war of Russia, continuing to increase the pressure on Russia, who cooperate with the Russian administration in Ukraine as they stop these unjustified attacks.</p>

However, the European community has clearly expressed that the culprit of the catastrophe can be only the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>According to Ukrinform, this is in an interview with the channel <a href="https://youtu.be/yErLHjfPDPw">Freedom</a>The EU Ambassador, the head of the EU Delegation Matti Maasikas, said.</p>
<p>“This is a terrible tragedy that followed <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vibuh">explosion</a>But the destruction of the dam in Nova Kakhovka is in fact a good example. Yes, there is a journalistic protocol that is obliged to give the word to the opposite side. But you see how a few policies such as the President of the European Council Charlmicell, the high representative of the EU on Foreign Policy and Security Policy, Josepborrell, said only Russia, ”Maasikas said.</p>
<p>He added that international publications, in addition to the comments of the parties, also take into account the experts.</p>
<p>“There are also several different experts who say that in all logic, only Russia will be. And this is obvious, since this dam is a nad -Russian occupation. They in any case bear for this responsibility, ”he said.</p>

<p>"It happens - and with journalists especially - when life puts a preying choice: to become a hero? It happens that it is much easier to bypass such a choice and stay somewhere in the gray area between good and evil - in the zinosajuneutrality. But anyone who does not pass it and resists evil, who is inheritance of things by their names and spreads the truth - can become a hero not only for a day. We live at a time when our freedom depends on all of us, when the world has to know the full truth about every crime against freedom in one world so that freedom is preserved everywhere. Evil now claims not only the country or another country, but on values. Our values with you. To be cut. And I thank you - and all Canada - for not joking with evil. I am for the support of our struggle for freedom!”</p>

<p>“Today, 95 more of our people have been returned from Russian captivity, 31 of them were Mariupol's defender. Most are ordinary and sergeants, two officers. Arms, National Guard, border guards. I thank our team: Budanov, Yermak, baby, lubin, who is engaged in exchanges, thank you for this result. Well done guys!Every Ukrainian, we have to pull every Ukrainian from Russian.</p>
<p>We continue our rescue operation in the south of Ukraine, and about 4 thousand people have been evacuated. Dozens of cities and villages remain flooded, the worst situation, as before, on a temporarily occupied part of Kherson region.</p>
<p>Again and again we thank our people: military, police officers, rescuers. I thank separately to volunteers, doctors, local authorities - to all who help to reflect people after a catastrophe at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, and especially thanks to those who help to get people, in particular, from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult, dangerous, it is a special heroism. Thank you for every saved life!</p>
<p>Russian terrorists continue to fire evacuation routes, punctures, boats on which people are taken out ... Today, three people were killed as a result of one of the same. It was an evacuation from Kardashinka, villages on the Left Bank of Kherson region ... The invaders created this disaster, undermined the Swing, threw people in the flooded cities and villages, and they still set up boats after which people try to take away ... even more innicated than you, the Russian state.</p>
<p>Representatives of the International Criminal Court visited the Kherson region these days. The first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a corresponding appeal to the Office of the International Criminal Court to the Office of the International Criminal Court to investigate this disaster, and the work has already begun.The full and fair responsibility of Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite that there will be no more repetition of such evil in the world.</p>
<p>Today, our state has taken another sanctional step. Against those who will serve the evil that the Russian state became. Against those who have helped to destroy the diligence in Russia and play one of the key roles in repression by natively occupied our territory and in the territory of Russia itself. 178 of the samists were added to our sanctions lists on the submission of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do our best and every one of this list of assistants of the Russian dictatorship is true of everything they had done against people and freedom. For every broken fate and for every criminal decision, which helps to turn into a terrorist state.</p>
<p>And one more. Of course, I am grateful to our soldiers for this day. Each of our battle, each of our division. Khortytsya, Tavriya - all who are contagious, all who are in positions, everyone who helps ... I thank you!Thank you for every book, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!</p>
<p>Glory to our heroes!Glory to all who protect the life of Ukraine and Ukrainians!</p>
<p>We will win!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!", - the address reads.</p>
