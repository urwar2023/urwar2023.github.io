<p>About it in an interview <a href="https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news%2C1593654%2Cgosc-studia-pap-robert-telus-ke-nie-chce-przedluzyc-zakazu-importu">PAP</a>Polish Robert Telus reported on Thursday, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“We will have a meeting in Warsaw on July 19. We also invited the Ministry of Republic of Ukraine, ”Telus informed.</p>

<p>He stressed that Poland and other EU countries, where the ban on imports of Ukrainian grain, "do not want to harm Ukraine".</p>
<p>“We do not want to harm Ukraine. We want to create tools that will allow Ukrainian products not to stay in Poland or in border countries, but to comply with Europe or outside Europe, ”the Polish minister stressed.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3726892-import-ukrainskogo-zbizza-u-polsi-proveli-perevirku-v-222-kompaniah.html)He noted that in the near future he will also speak on this topic with the Minister of Supreme Economy of Lithuania, which did not join the countries that require an embargoo for Ukrainian grain.</p>
<p>Telus expressed the opinion that the reluctance of the European Commission to continue after September 15, to import up to five EU countries of Ukrainian grain has a political substance. According to him, Brussels do not want to make such a decision by pre -Parliamentary elections in Poland.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the European Commission forbade the import of wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower from Ukraine to Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Romania at the insistence of these countries. On June 5, the prohibition was proceeded by September 15, 2023.Poland has suspended transit of Ukrainian agro -agricultural products through its territory, but renewed it from April 21.</p>
<p>Warsaw hopes that the ban on import of Ukrainian grain will be reinforced and after September 15, and that some other types of products from Ukraine will be added to the list of prohibited products.</p>
<p>One of the arguments of Warsaw to ban the import of Ukrainian grain to Poland, the import of technical grain, which was later sold as a consumer, as well as the passage of a large amount of Ukrainian grain to the Polish market, from which Polish agrarians were present.</p>
<p>The parliamentary elections in Poland will probably take place in October. The exact Datuvibor President of Poland should be indicated by mid -August.</p>

<p>This was emphasized by the director of economic programs of the Ukrainian Institute of Guide(IIF)Anatoly Amelin <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1619640075197535">during the presentation of the Ukrainian economy forecast for 2023-2024</a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“Among the events that will influence the economy of Ukraine and the world, one of the main ones will be the election of the US President. Their results will affect the volume of help to Ukraine. We already hear the rhetoric of Donald Trump, who says that we do not need to spend American money on Ukraine. Of course, his victory will not be unknown that Ukraine will stop, because in the US several centers of influence, the Ipresident is only one of them. But this can affect the amount of this assistance, ”Amelin has been.</p>

According to Meelina, there are currently several local "points" that can start starting to the beginning of this crisis, and then the effect of the domino will spread the process to the general economy. For Ukraine, which is very dependent on international assistance, this is a high risk.</p>
<p>The next global trend will be to strengthen the sanction policy towards Russia of friendly countries.</p>
<p>“This trend will be, but we see, unfortunately, that the sanctions that are currently considering Russia have no great effect. She still has superstition in order to continue wars. Yes, they are limited to obtaining a revenue from the sale of energy resources, but they still receive the money. Therefore, these sanctions are not enough and should be strengthened, first of all, countries and companies that help them to circumvent sanctions, ” - said.</p>

<p>The results of European studies that formed the basis of the strategic forecast of 20123, today in Brussels during the press conference, presented the Security president of the European Commission, Marosh Shefchovich, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“The annual strategic forecast is the opportunity to see our successes and the following steps. At a time when the danger is increasing and open conflicts are released at the borders of Europe, a strategic forecast allows us to get better for a vast future and to predict the development of events that can influence us. To put it briefly, it can make Europe more resistant, ”Shefchovich said.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3731312-evrokomisia-zaklikae-do-prodovzenna-cornomorskoi-zernovoi-iniciativi.html)He stressed that this year's report focuses on the issues of social stability and well-being of people who should be at the center of any direction of European policy, and pour into such key areas as the economy of the environment, the stability of the social model of liberal democracy.</p>
<p>The Vice president of the European Commission has named several key conclusions that publish the opposed document.</p>
<p>“First, we are facing challenges in effective international cooperation. It is reflected because of the battle of narratives that are obviously now turning a doctrine(social)models. In other words, we have to admit that the time, the raliberal democracy was a model of obvious choice, ended. Liberallyidemocracy is increasingly facing the challenges of autocractions, which of the models is more effective for solving the growing social thaeconomic problems, ”the European Commission spokesman said.</p>

<p>“The second conclusion is that social policy and prosperity should be the center of political decision -making and economic indicators. This means the need for clarification of GDP indicators and standards, which characterized economic growth, stability and well -being for almost a century. For example, it is necessary to predict what GDP will be based on the life expectancy, which depends on the state of health. In this dimension, we can expect the EU GDP to grow by 15.5 percent by 2040 - it is higher than you can expect in other countries, such as the US, China or India, ” - said Shefchovich.</p>
<p>The third conclusion, he said, is that Europe should move in attracting a majority of private investment for strategic projects, in particular, the osshel of the "green" transformation. This can be achieved through the use of state funds as a "catalyst" to inflow private investment, in particular to maintain risky and "breakthrough" innovative projects. In this context, according to Shefchovich, the European Investment Bank should play its role, in particular, in promoting green and digital transformation, transformation in key areas, such as providing raw materials, the development of green technologies and biotechnology.</p>

<p>The European Commission will submit a projected report in 2023 to the EU Member States during the EU Council on July 10, this document will also be cooked during an informal meeting of Heads of State and EU Government of Visapan Granada in October this year.

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent in New York, a UN Radsebz Council was stated on Thursday at the United States by UN Landa Thomas Grinfield.</p>
<p>She indicated that Russia was using Iranian drones against Ukrainian largest and civilian infrastructure. Over the past few weeks, the Russian Federation has repeatedly implemented attacks with the help of these UAVs, which has led to the destruction of Ukrainian civilian objects and the death of civilians.</p>
<p>"Moreover, we have shared publicly with the secretariat that the Russian was working with Iran on the production of Iranian UAVs in Russia," emphasize Grinfield. - In particular, Russia receives from Iran the materials needed for the construction of the production plant <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bezpilotnik">UAV</a>in Russia".</p>
<p>According to her, this plant can be commissioned in the early year. In the event of construction, it "will significantly strengthen the potential for the attack on Ukraine and will allow Russia to continue the campaign of disruption of Ukrainian power plants, the closure of railways and to interfere with the transit of agricultural goods into world markets," the post -press.</p>

<p>Thomas Grinfield has regretted the fact that the reported non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is published today, "is incomplete because it does not fully covers the recent violations associated with unmanned aircraft."</p>
<p>According to her, the Secretariat did not accept proposals from Ukraine and other sides to consider the undeniable evidence of these violations. "This is a unclear gap," she added.</p>
<p>"The UN should, without any further delay, send a group of investigators to study the wreckage of weapons that Russia uses against Ukraine and which is blocked by Ukraine and the United Kingdom," Thomas Grinfield emphasized.Iranian development and dissemination of UAV is a global threat, explained.

The enterprise will exist under the cover of the company "Albatros", which is engaged in "creation of farm unmanship". Although this structure openly sells for the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reconnaissance drones, but probably the enterprises will also work with drones-Kamikadze, in FT.</p>
<p>Ilya Voronkov, a co -founder of the company, confessed to the publication that supplies <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bezpilotnik">drones</a>Russian military. He also asserted that 70% of the components for its drones receive the company in the Russian Federation and the engine from China.</p>
<p>The Russian firm "Albatros", which has previously specialized in "agricultural technologies", has built its new plant in the special economic zone of "Alabuga" in Tatarstan - a place that is considered to be the centrolum by Tehran in the United States to develop the potential of Moscow in production.</p>

Since October 2022, Business Park has been looking for candidates for such assets as "UAV production director", "UAV designer" and "UAV Chief Technologist". Business Park also posted an announcement of search engines from Farsi, who will need to go on a business trip, perform synchronous translation and translate technical documents.</p>
<p>In June, the White House released satellite photos that identified the two -building in the Alabuga area as a key part of Iran's attempts to help Muscowns to increase the production of their drones. "We are also concerned that Russia is working with Iran for the production of Iranian UAVs from the inside of Russia," said John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council.</p>

<p>The F-16 multi-purpose fighter can increase the efficiency of our air defense to run by night missile attacks on cities and important objects. About this, commenting on today's shelling of the "caliber" of Lviv, told the Colonel of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>According to him, it is a plane that is created to be part of the air defense and intercept such types of air goals as the winged rockets of Chirons-Kamikadze. The air defense forces destroy hostile targets to cities or important persons, but we need a plane that could destroy these goals for route. The presence at the operative airfields of the next forces of such closers would significantly increase the efficiency of counteracting the enemy's air attacks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-06T69-00-00-04-00/f-16-scaled.jpg" />He also noted that the planes we currently have - these are Soviet water, their equipment, and weapons are not able to resist the modern winged missiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we expect all partners decisive steps <em>(As for the supply of Ukraine</em> <em>f</em> <em>-16. - Ed.)</em>, since every day of delay brings the following seizures that we have seen today in Lviv and see almost every night in other places, - said the spokesman of the Armed Forces Command.</li>

<p>About it <a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/rosiia-formuie-novi-shturmovi-pidrozdily-shtorm-zet-z-chysla-uviaznenykh.html">reports</a>GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can confirm that they [detachments "Storm Zet"] are fighting against Ukraine, but significant casualties due to low level of preparation. There are also prone case cases where the Zecs from the newly created penalty units set up internal "showdowns" with shooting, deserted the Zaporizhia equipment together. That is, this scooter, the Zek Zecs is difficult to control, - said the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Chernyak.</li>
</ul>
<p>The representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine questioned that the Wagnets on the polyb would be replaced by the Kadyrivtsi.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having suffered enormous losses in the first year of a large -scale invasion of Russia, "Kadyrivtsi" avoid participation in hostilities. Their work is mostly terror and looting in the occupied territories, - said Andrey Chernyak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chechen Putin's infantryman is primarily worried about his own skin, so his private army is always located near Kadyrov. The attempt of Wagner's rebellion showed that the Kremlin suzerain structures are quite fragile. Chipotov Kadyrov send their most capable detachments for such conditions? - explained the representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He recalled that hidden mobilization did not stop in Russia. According to Pandry Chernyak, the multimillion-dollar Muscovy has no problems with human resources. It is more acute for the aggressor state is the issue of preparation and armed ones, whom the Kremlin sent to the war against Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, now Russia is trying to slow down the offensive actions of the Ukrainian troops, stabilize and freeze the front line in order to gather, prepare, prepare and arms reserves for a long war, but our task is to destroy all other plans of the enemy, - summed up the GUR.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-06T91-00-00-04-00/donory.jpeg" />More than 60% of battle deaths are related to blood loss. Timely transfusion of healing blood or its components can significantly reduce this percentage, as it will allow you to win time to send the wounded to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>This is on a single webport of the executive authorities of Ukraine <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/moz-rishennia-uriadu-nablyzylo-donorsku-krov-do-frontu">notes</a>Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Every day, defenders and defenders of Ukraine heroically defend the peace of Ukraine. Each of them risks their own life and health for peace, victory and restoration of our territorial integrity.</p>
<p>In war, there are injuries and injuries that are incompatible with life. However, there are also tissues that can be prevented. It is about heroes with massive blood loss. In a timely wounds timely stopping of bleeding - only the first stage of assistance. The second stage is no less important. It involves the recovery of the blood that has been saved. Timely transfusion(transfusion)The whole donor blood can save more than one life by the supra.</p>
<p>The resolution developed by the Ministry of Health must streamline the mechanism of donor blood and its components and bring them closer to the front. Counterly identifies and regulates the logistics chains of obtaining a donor civil and its components with medical units. Without unnecessary bureaucracy of the paneoptimally organized procedures.</p>
<p>From now on, the mechanism of security and defense forces in donor blood deals with the request for the required blood volumes from combat units. According to the opportunity to prepare and deliver to the war zone in time.</p>
<p>The resolution also stipulates that each medical unit determines the person responsible for the order of donor blood and its components. At the same time, doctors independently decide how they are more convenient to order blood - branches or from individual medical units. This makes the system flexible to the operational situation on the front.</p>
<p>The process of obtaining donor blood and its components with medical units of force safety and defense is simple and understandable. It provides such an algorithm of action:In fact, the tasks of the units are reduced to the formation of applications and reports in which the responsible persons of medical units provide a minimum necessary information. This approach allows military doctors to spend optimally one time and do not make unnecessary efforts to find and ensure the delivery of a donor blood and its components.</p>
<p>At the same time, the resolution defined the algorithm of actions of medical units in critical situations, such as the mass receipt of the wounded. In this case, medical units can take away the required amount of Donor Claw and its components in the auxiliary temporary blood bank, which will only be known to them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, medical units will now be able to send their nursing staff to the blood centers for training of transfusions. As the result - the implementation of this resolution will facilitate the provision of medical services to medical services in accordance with NATO standards set by TCSS protocols(Tactical Сombat Сasualty Сare).</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the unit No. 5 has worked at the energy levels of power, and since September 2022 the occupation administration of the station has supported its work in a state of hot stop. Already, the invaders deliberately violate a number of basic requirements for the operation of the energy block, including ignoring the planned schedule of maintenance of system safety, sabotage of overhaul of equipment of the reactor department of the reactor department of the oil -mechanical repair, electrical equipment of the turbine supply and control systems.</p>
<p>In addition, the service life of the equipment that is subject to replacement is exhausted. In particular, more than 1000 units of thermal mechanical equipment and more than 100 - electrical.</p>

<p>“The number one priority is aircraft. We need more complex systems such as Patriot, Nasams, Iris-T, SAMP-T, small radius systems. Fighting. But this is a political decision. I hope we will have an F-16, a cerestalistic plan. The priority of the number two is different types of artillery camp for them. Weapons to combat drones that Russians are massively launched in Ukraine. We need cheaper solutions. We need radars, the system of emergence of air goals for their effective destruction, ”the Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine said.</p>
<p>Given the future NATO summit, which will take place next week, the parties discussed the expectations and prospects for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We look at life realistically and understand that we do not get a member of NATO during the war. However, the question remains: when we win, the attack will be 100 percent, what will be the security architecture in the world, including the Uevropi? Ukraine is the eastern shield of Europe. Russia, in turn, remains an imperial aggressor that dreams of Gathering Land Plan. If Ukraine fell, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia would be the following countries. And the Russians may have stopped if they were rebuilt. According to one of their analytical centers in the fall of 2021, more than 80% of Russians were convinced that the occupation of Estonia and Poland is a good idea. Yes, it's their thinking.

The expectations of Ukrainians every way to the Alliance are extremely high, about 90% of citizens support the introduction, this is the first time in the history of Ukraine. That is why we expect a serious, real, pragmatic and practical signal that Ukraine will become a member of NATO de jure, because we are already a partner of the Alliance de facto, ”the minister said.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-06T97-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-2.jpeg" />Among the mass of Russian misinformation, it is absolutely absurd and dangerous confirmation that helping Ukraine, including weapons or sanctions, makes it longer and does not help restore security.</p>
<p>This was stated during his speech before Bulgarian politicians, representatives of the public and 3ma Volodymyr Zelenskyy - <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/oboronna-pidtrimka-ce-poryatunok-svobodi-vistup-prezidenta-u-84117">writes</a>The official website of the President of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Probably you could hear such absurd statements. It is always important to refute, because war is a time when any ignoring of reality is prevented from ending war. Reality speaks for itself, namely: they have significantly reduced the scale of this war. First of all, thanks to the weapons we are, ”the head of the Ukrainian state said.</p>
<p>He informed the audience at a briefing that about 1900 cities and villages of the Ukrainian land were already liberated by our soldiers during February 24 last year. To the Ukrainians, it is necessary to go a very, very difficult way to release the reproduction of the whole territory.</p>
<p>“We reflected Russian attacks on our northern regions, the capital of Ukraine. Missed large territories of the east and south of our country. We started creating a powerful air shield that can become the basis of a pan -European air shield, and have already proven that there are no missiles in Russia that could not be confused, - said Volodymyr Zelenskyy. - We destroyed everything in the battles, I am, I am, all the most capable part of the Russian army. Putin is now to humiliate against such modes as in Iran to get a weapon to continue his terror. "</p>

About it <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayini-dlya-uspishnogo-kontrnastupu-vazhlivo-vchasno-otrim-84121">stated</a>President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky, answering questions during a meeting with representatives of political circles, public and media of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>According to the Head of State, during the occupation of the Ukrainian lands, the eradica -shaped three lines of defense. The Russian army is massively changing enthusiastic territories to prevent the promotion of Ukrainian troops, and a lot of special equipment is required to overcome this.</p>
<p>“We have a completely replaced area, and our boys have to go forward. The Union is neutral. There are states that think for a long time. There are bureaucratic processes. Put in front of a global multifaceted call, because we walk on foot, exchanging, and then there is a technique. There is a difference: to walk or go with technique, ”he said.</p>
<p>According to the President, Ukrainian armed forces forcefully interact techniques, shells and ammunition to move forward. And with a pragmatic look to build the Ukrainian army - in the</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-06T98-00-00-04-00/2.jpeg" />In particular, the Head of State said that during his meeting today, they had a full understanding of the Bulgaria Rumen Radev in matters concerning the energy and Ukrainian formula of peace, while on the issue of defense assistance to Ukraine, their views differ.</p>
<p>“He thinks it is an escalation - to provide assistance to Ukraine. And I think - no, Caes protection, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>The President of Ukraine disagrees with the statement of a colleague about the inadmissibility of reducing weapons in Bulgaria's army for the help of Ukraine, since the arms of the Bulgarian army alone will not be enough to stop Russia.</p>
<p>"I said frankly: if Russia goes on, your weapon will not be enough. Even if it will be five times more than you have now. Our weapons were also not enough - we were helped by partners, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.“And if some leaders are very pragmatic, at least from this point of view to understand: while Ukrainians are fighting - help them. Otherwise, there is a probability that every one will come to you, ”the head of state said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-06T98-00-00-04-00/3-1.jpeg" />The President also noted that for the Ukrainian people a very important motivational factor would be a clear signal of the prospect of acquiring Ukraine's membership in NATO at a summit in Vilnius, as it was with the granting of EU members in June 2022.</p>
<p>“We understand that in NATO we will be in a few years or after the war - how the members of the Alliance will be. But it is necessary to give a signal to motivate Ukraine to protect Europe. This is not such a high price for such a war and for such suffering, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy recalled.</p>
