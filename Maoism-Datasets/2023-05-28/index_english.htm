It also allows you to efficiently combine intellectual capital, encourage the exchange of knowledge and remain Vavagard of technological achievements. This is especially relevant in the context of new agents, such as cyber, hybrid war, autonomy and artificial intelligence.In addition, the Last NATO Parliamentary Assembly has become an important platform for awareness of the Alliance of Multinational Procurement and Logistics Alliance, especially in the context of discussing a tassel on the Alliance's Security Decision.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, the Head of Aviation of the Armed Forces Command Brigade General Sergey Golubtsov in an interview [Donbassrealia] told about it.(https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/my-zmozhemo-zavoyuvaty-perevahu-v-povitri/32429248.html).</p>
<p>"If we realize that we have a group against us, let's say 50 squadron and 39erodromes, of which they perform tasks, of course, we would like more. win the advantage in the air and make the enemy give off the blows that they now strike in a certain area, on a certain struggle, "he said.</p>

<p>Golubtsov added that in order to plan the operation of destruction or task of blows, it should be understood that there is still some echelon of security.

<p>He noted that even a couple of aircraft capable of starting a rocket for more than 100 kilometers will make the enemy think and react.</p>
<p>According to him, the F-16 is able to become part of air defense to ensure the fighter covering within the country.

<p>"Of course, the advantages of tactical or operational, the enemy in the air is not due to the fact that Ukraine has received a fairly powerful building from partner countries: radar detection, observation, anti-aircraft missile complex goals, "Golubtsov said.</p>

It is not saved by neither Shahda nor any other means of terror that she is humiliating in the world. Because the strength - it is in the city, it is in cities, it is in life, and when life and people are despised, and people who are more important for the culture of the city, will only lose for Russia. And even the hundred "Shahmed" will not be saved from it. They will only add shame on Russia.</p>
<p>These days we congratulate on the city of Kyiv and Alexandria, Severodonetsk, Kalush, Kryvyi Rih ... cities of different fate, but of the same respect. Our Ukraine. Our belief that we will pass this extremely difficult stage of history ... We will pass, and all our cities will be free, and people will be protected from any evil, which can threaten our country.</p>

Our civil servants. Our diplomats. Thank you all who strengthen our defense, our country, our people!</p>
<p>The fact that our capital is free is that our cities are protected - protecting, that we will release every occupied city now is all merit of people. All who are fighting and working for the sake of Ukraine. It is a merit of our kind people who can do historical things. When united. When it realizes its power. When nothing forgives the enemy. And when he inspires the world.</p>

<p>About it reports Ukrinform with reference to <a href="http://t.me/Ukrenergo/2109">telegram</a>Ukrenergo.</p>
<p>“Night attack by the Russians <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bezpilotnik">drones</a>She did not cause new damage to the energy infrastructure of the manufacturing networks. Thanks to our incredible air forces of the Armed Forces, 52hehads were destroyed, ”the message said.</p>
<p>It is noted that on Saturday, May 27, from 9:00 pm to 22:00 to cover the evening bid of consumption, the power system of Ukraine took an emergency assistance to Romania. Emergency aid is not a commercial import. The rapid response is a rapid response measure for balancing the power system. The reason for the use of emergency care was the lack of total capacity of Ukrainian power plants.</p>
<p>Imports from Slovakia were carried out, but in the evening it was insignificant. The use of emergency aid from neighboring countries is possible due to the synchronous operation of Ukraine's power system with the European ENTSO-E energy system.</p>
<p>Currently, electricity is sufficient to cover the needs of consumers, but in the evening "Ukrenergo" asks to consume electricity. In general, all thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants and hydroelectric power plants have undergone massive rocket and drone attacks. So, to restore and prepare them for the next heating season, it is necessary to carry out significant repairs.</p>

<p>Про це повідомляє власний кореспондент Укрінформу в Австрії.</p>
<p>Забіг відбувався у прямому сенсі під каштанами – саме ці дерева рясновисаджені вздовж алеї у парку Пратерштерн, де й відбувався забіг.</p>
<p>Дорослі учасники долали дистанції у п’ять та два кілометри. Для наймолодшихбула можливість пробігти 500 метрів.</p>
<p>Багато учасників були одягнуті у вишиванки та мали з собою українськусимволіку, тим самим ідентифікуючи себе та привертаючи увагу відвідувачівпарку до триваючої війни РФ проти України.</p>
<p>«Ювілейний 30-й «Пробіг під каштанами» проходить у Відні на тему «Пробіг там,де ти». Зараз усі ми знаходимося тут, у Відні, тимчасово, і хочемо повернутисядодому. Ми усі хочемо, щоб Україна перемогла у цій війні. І ми маємо надію, щонаступні пробіги будемо робити вже в Україні – під каштанами у Києві на ДеньКиєва", - повідомила у коментарі кореспонденту агентства організатор пробігу уВідні Олена Листопад, яка є учасницею «Пробігу під каштанами» з 2014 року.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, Podolyak said in an interview with the Italian edition of Larepubblica, reports <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/news/bud-yakij-kompromis-iz-rosiyeyu-ce-pryamij-shlyah-do-nastupn-83205">Presidential Office</a>.</p>
<p>“First, the Russian Federation will have a conversation about the true conditions of the end of the war exclusively on the battlefield. And after such a "conversation" offered by our armory forces, she will not have a choice. Secondly, the formula of peace will be attached to the world democratic community, which fixes the logistics of the only possible end of the war, ”Podolyak said.</p>
<p>In addition, he said, after all the large -scale destruction and murder, which was made in Ukraine, Ukrainians are not compromised with the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The adviser to the head of the Presidential Office reminded that for almost nine years, the Ukrainian has been reaching out at the negotiation table, but as a result, it received a full -scale war, which has not seen a world since the Second World War.</p>
<p>"Any compromise with the Russian Federation is a direct path to the next stages of war, escalation, a significant strengthening of the role of global terrorism. The main point of the peace plan is the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The conversations of the Russians will only start after that, ”Podolyak emphasized.</p>
<p>According to him, there are no other real plans, except the Ukrainian formula of peace, and Kiev will not accept other proposals because they are provided with the support of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“Any other initiative today is an attempt to sell the Russian plan, the declulic moment is an immediate ceasefire, but without the withdrawal of the Russian Occupation Group. This is a completely unacceptable position, not aimed at peace, ana security, in fact, victory of Russia. And most importantly - why to generally to break the initiatives, which stands for the figures of the Russians and their unwillingness to the brothers responsibility for enormous crimes against humanity? ” - emphasized the head of the Presidential Office.</p>

<p>Як зазначив Подоляк, українська формула миру – це основа запланованих мирнихпереговорів, а учасники саміту можуть доповнити своїми корисними ідеями. Алеключовим моментом є перший пункт – вихід Російської Федерації з усієїтериторії України, включно з Донбасом і Кримом.</p>
<p>«Сьогодні лідери світової демократії як ніколи єдині у розумінні природивійни, позиції Росії та правильного шляху припинення війни. Ми розуміємо, якіінструменти для цього потрібні: зброя, правовий механізм притягнення довідповідальності за злочин агресії, репарації та відновлення, відкритий обмінполоненими й повернення депортованих громадян. Головне – військова поразкаРосії й неодмінне повернення нам окупованих територій», – переконаний радниккерівника Офісу Глави держави.</p>
<p>За словами Подоляка, над проведенням мирного саміту працюють представникиУкраїни, країн G7 та Північної Європи. Коло учасників поступово розширюється,тож очікується участь десятків держав демократичного світу. Приєднатися можутьусі країни, зацікавлені у поверненні світу до справедливих глобальних правил,до міжнародного права й поваги до суверенітету держав.</p>
<p>Відповідаючи на запитання про те, чи Росія буде учасником майбутнього мирногосаміту, радник керівника Офісу Президента сказав: «А який сенс кудисьзапрошувати росіян після того, як вони навмисне нападають на іншу країну,навмисне порушують міжнародне право, навмисне обстрілюють мирне населенняракетами? Росіяни абсолютно не готові визнавати свою причетність довеликомасштабного злочину та використовують будь-який міжнародний майданчиквиключно для поширення своєї ненависті».</p>
<p>Щодо будь-яких вимог стосовно членства України в міжнародних організаціях, яківисуває Російська Федерація, то, як наголосив Подоляк, лише український народсамостійно визначить своє майбутнє, членство в міжнародних організаціях ібезпекових об’єднаннях.</p>
<p>«Суверенітет Росії поширюється виключно на територію Росії в межах міжнародновизнаних кордонів», – зауважив він.</p>
<p>На думку радника керівника Офісу Президента, спільний кордон із державою-агресором, яка понад дев’ять років веде війну проти України, вимагає посиленнямілітаризації з метою стримування її агресивних настроїв.</p>

<p>“The main lesson we have made during the year of this war is to practice in practice. Through our own actions, we were able to learn new lessons: how to remain stable, confident and how to defend our values. I am particularly proud of the collectively democratic world and the individual and the right state of Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic, and those decisions that were tied in support of Ukraine. All these actions and decisions are stories of success, ”Viceremier -Minister.</p>
<p>One of the most important decisions, she said, was the granting of Ukraine's status to Ukraine. The government official noted that on June 23, all members <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz">EU</a>demonstrated unity and infallibility, and Ukraine has gained the prospect of the future - a peaceful, within the European family.</p>
<p>“We need to start from these lessons. We are still far from the strategic ease of future security architecture. But we are very close to developing it, and I think it is time to make some decisions. It is about many years of strategic uncertainty about Euro -Atlantic aspirations - one of the decisions that the Russian Federation has been speculating for years. Due to the acceptance of political decisions on the involvement of Ukraine in the family of European and Euro -Atlantic defense architecture, we must finally recognize the obvious: without Ukraine there is no architecture of European security, ” - statementlastfanishina.</p>
<p>The main issues of discussion were the strengthening of defense support of Ukraine, as well as the reconstruction and post -war recovery.</p>

Our belief that we will pass this extremely difficult stage of history ... We will pass, and all our cities will be free, and people will be protected from any evil, which can threaten our country.</p>

<p>Golubtsov added that in order to plan the operation of destruction or task of blows, it should be understood that there is still some echelon of security.

<p>He noted that even a couple of aircraft capable of starting a rocket for more than 100 kilometers will make the enemy think and react.</p>

In interviewing Government Courier, Deputy Head of the State Secretariat of Communications Volodymyr Trofimenko told where Ukrainian broadcasting will finally help, how it will help to resist the enemy at the information front and what are the benefits of MH-7. About it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsszzi/posts/pfbid02kjLtWdDf71UM1GXheYwE3nNMKKG9vu6v1oeexMoDN6KX8JDWwc25rscCNVdZkwfwl">reports</a>State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The main thing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>To understand the danger of Russia, it is enough to mention the number of shelling of objects that provide signal broadcasting. The RRT TVs in Kiev, Kharkiv, Vinnitsa and other cities of the country have repeatedly called missile attacks. In the Kherson region, the enemy, retreating, physically destroy the infrastructure, that it is more difficult for us to return Ukrainian speech to the territory of the territory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our task now is not only to quickly restore all infrastructure, but also to provide new opportunities for our citizens to be constantly in the Ukrainian information space.</p>
<ul>
<li>The available networks do not cover television broadcasting up to a third of the territory of Ukraine. Acceptance of digital television in the territories, border SFF and RB is complicated. Particularly urgent problem in Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Rivne, Zhytomyr, Volyn regions, where the population is able to accept Russian TV channels from the powerful transfer stations of the Russian Federation of IRB. The launch of the MX-7 multiplex will be able to cover more than 90%of the territory of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>-The MX-7 network has more transmission stations and better energy assaults than existing multifams, which affects their capacity. Therefore, receiving the signal will be available in areas where it does not now have a slightly signal or relief features. Turning powerful transmitters in the meter will increase the coverage of temporarily occupied territories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our task was to make the state network of broadcasting as much as possible for every Ukrainian. Speech access for viewers will be free and open. Also, most MX-7 multiplex users are not able to spend money on buying equipment, they already need it.</li>
</ul>

None of them will be here!Kiev and all our cities, all Ukraine will put a point in the history of Moscow despotism, which for a very long time has been a different peoples. It is not saved by neither Shahda nor any other means of terror that she is humiliating in the world. Because the power - it is in the way, it is in cities, it is in life, and when life and people are despised, and people who are more important for the city's culture, will only lose for Russia. And even the hundred "Shahmed" will not be saved from it. They will only add shame on Russia.</p>

Our belief that we will pass this extremely difficult stage of history ... We will pass, and all our cities will be free, and people will be protected from any evil, which can threaten our country.</p>
<p>Today, I want to thank all our people who fought and fight for the adviser - all our soldiers, all types of armed forces and the rays of the troops, every Brigade, every unit. Thank you!To all who are in battle, everyone who is in combat operations to everyone who is in combat posts!Thank you to everyone in the world who is not indifferent and who wants the victory of freedom as well as we.</p>

Our civil servants. Our diplomats. Thank you all who strengthen our defense, our country, our people!</p>
<p>The fact that our capital is free is that our cities are protecting - they are protecting, that we will release every occupied city now - all this is a merit of people. All who are fighting and working for the sake of Ukraine. It is a merit of our kind people who can do historical things. When united. When it realizes its power. When nothing forgives the enemy.
