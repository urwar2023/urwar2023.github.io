Emergency aid is not a commercial import. The rapid response is a rapid response measure for balancing the power system.

Imports from Slovakia were carried out, but in the evening it was insignificant. The use of emergency aid from neighboring countries is possible due to the synchronous operation of Ukraine's power system with the European ENTSO-E energy system.
Currently, electricity is sufficient to cover the needs of consumers, but in the evening "Ukrenergo" asks to consume electricity. In general, all thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants and hydroelectric power plants have undergone massive rocket and drone attacks. So, to restore and prepare them for the next heating season, it is necessary to carry out significant repairs.

 Advisor to the Presidential Office of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak stated that any compromise with Russia is a direct path to the next stages of war, escalation, a significant strengthening of the role of global terrorism.
According to Ukrinform, Podolyak said in an interview with the Italian edition of Larepubblica, reports Presidential Office .
“First, the Russian Federation will have a conversation about the true conditions of the end of the war exclusively on the battlefield. And after such a "conversation" offered by our armory forces, she will not have a choice. Secondly, the formula of peace will be attached to the world democratic community, which fixes the logistics of the only possible end of the war, ”Podolyak said.
In addition, he said, after all the large -scale destruction and murder, which was made in Ukraine, Ukrainians are not compromised with the Kremlin.
The adviser to the head of the Presidential Office reminded that for almost nine years, the Ukrainian has been reaching out at the negotiation table, but as a result, it received a full -scale war, which has not seen a world since the Second World War.
"Any compromise with the Russian Federation is a direct path to the next stages of war, escalation, a significant strengthening of the role of global terrorism. The main point of the peace plan is the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. The conversations of the Russians will only start after that, ”Podolyak emphasized.
According to him, there are no other real plans, except the Ukrainian formula of peace, and Kiev will not accept other proposals because they are provided with the support of the Russian Federation.
“Any other initiative today is an attempt to sell the Russian plan, the declulic moment is an immediate ceasefire, but without the withdrawal of the Russian Occupation Group. This is a completely unacceptable position, not aimed at peace, ana security, in fact, victory of Russia. And most importantly - why to generally to break the initiatives, which stands for the figures of the Russians and their unwillingness to the brothers responsibility for enormous crimes against humanity? ” - emphasized the head of the Presidential Office.

Як зазначив Подоляк, українська формула миру – це основа запланованих мирнихпереговорів, а учасники саміту можуть доповнити своїми корисними ідеями. Алеключовим моментом є перший пункт – вихід Російської Федерації з усієїтериторії України, включно з Донбасом і Кримом.
«Сьогодні лідери світової демократії як ніколи єдині у розумінні природивійни, позиції Росії та правильного шляху припинення війни. Ми розуміємо, якіінструменти для цього потрібні: зброя, правовий механізм притягнення довідповідальності за злочин агресії, репарації та відновлення, відкритий обмінполоненими й повернення депортованих громадян. Головне – військова поразкаРосії й неодмінне повернення нам окупованих територій», – переконаний радниккерівника Офісу Глави держави.
За словами Подоляка, над проведенням мирного саміту працюють представникиУкраїни, країн G7 та Північної Європи. Коло учасників поступово розширюється,тож очікується участь десятків держав демократичного світу. Приєднатися можутьусі країни, зацікавлені у поверненні світу до справедливих глобальних правил,до міжнародного права й поваги до суверенітету держав.
Відповідаючи на запитання про те, чи Росія буде учасником майбутнього мирногосаміту, радник керівника Офісу Президента сказав: «А який сенс кудисьзапрошувати росіян після того, як вони навмисне нападають на іншу країну,навмисне порушують міжнародне право, навмисне обстрілюють мирне населенняракетами? Росіяни абсолютно не готові визнавати свою причетність довеликомасштабного злочину та використовують будь-який міжнародний майданчиквиключно для поширення своєї ненависті».
Щодо будь-яких вимог стосовно членства України в міжнародних організаціях, яківисуває Російська Федерація, то, як наголосив Подоляк, лише український народсамостійно визначить своє майбутнє, членство в міжнародних організаціях ібезпекових об’єднаннях.
«Суверенітет Росії поширюється виключно на територію Росії в межах міжнародновизнаних кордонів», – зауважив він.
На думку радника керівника Офісу Президента, спільний кордон із державою-агресором, яка понад дев’ять років веде війну проти України, вимагає посиленнямілітаризації з метою стримування її агресивних настроїв.
