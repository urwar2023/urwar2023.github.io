 The aggressor state of Russia forcibly exports civilian population from the occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, including the staff of the captured AAP in Energodar.
“It is about people who either deliberately worked on the aggressor or were forced to do. They are told that hostilities will soon begin, that this territory will be fired and bombed, so they will convince and work with the Russians, ”said Andrey Chernyak, a representative of the RBC-Ukraine.
According to a representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the so-called evacuation of the packed territories of southern Ukraine, Russians use as a screen to carry counterintelligence and filtration measures: “They, first, are bad that the population can observe their preparation for battles-that is, certain counterintelligence measures. It is also filtration, because, first of all, there is a forced export of the pro -Ukrainian population. And thirdly, the Russians are afraid of holding in these territories of some guerrilla movement and internal resistance, ”Andrey Chernyak said.
At the same time a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the removal of Russian combat units from Zaporizhzhya, or from the Kherson regions, is not being recorded. In the occupied territories of these two regions, there are now approximately 152 thousand personnel of enemy troops, and all their actions indicate that they are preparing a pre -defense.

 In Ukrinform presented the book "Ukraine: Journalists on the front line". The editions are administered to the masters of the words that were defense of our country both on the information front and on the battlefield. The peculiarity of the book is that the journalists act in it in two hypostases - as authors and as heroes of stories.
The book contains more than 60 essays, combined in six sections, the first of which - "on the leading land" tells of military journalists who serve the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Among them-an essay about our colleague Vladislavoloshin, who saw with his own eyes and described more than ten wars, and when this war began in 2014, he participated in the creation of the ATO press center, he frequently on business trips on the forefront, and now continues to document the Opirals.
The same cover contains materials of different genres: reports, interviews, essays, reviews, as well as photographs and documents. These are the living evidence of eyewitnesses of the content of events and the impression of direct participants in hostilities, experienced work and information resistance.
The book also feeds on other editions that describe the course of large-scale interaction and poems of poet journalists, written after February 24, 2022.
The publication became a kind of continuation of the book that was published in the early 2022 - "Journalists in the War", the compiled by the head of the Kiev organization Mikhail Soroka. There are stories about the events of the Russian-Ukrainian war since 2014. Mikhail Mikhailovich, who was the presenter of the presentation of the book "Ukraine: Journalists on the Advanced", announced the beginning of work on the Thirdtoom, which, convinced, will describe our victory.
The head of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine Serhiy Tomilenko said in his own, 59 Ukrainian journalists were killed in the war, including14 - during his professional duties. One of the books of the book is "Memory". In it, the essays of the died of colleagues and friends-Mikola Kravchenko, Alexander Kuzenkov, Alexei Chubashev, Maxim Levin, Irina Tzvil, Pavel Lee, Dmitry Shipovsky. As well as the material of our colleague Olgimossonz about Dmitry Labutkin's TV studio officer. The attendees were honored with a moment of silence ...
 
Military journalist Colonel Sergey Kuzmin and Head of the Department of Military Comrade of the Window Colonel Alexei Poznyakov shared the experience of cooperation between public and civilian journalists during the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Editor of the Ivanka District Newspaper "Tribune of Labor" in Kyiv region Pavlo Smovzh, ex-editor of the newspaper "Donetskchina" Igor Zots, Professor of the Department of Social Communications of the Educational and Scientific Institute of Journalism that entered the book.
Of course, the presented publication does not claim exhaustiveness - too wide the Jauralist palette of belligerent Ukraine. However, this book contains great masses of specific facts that will be useful for future researchers of the Russian-Ukrainian war and perhaps to those who will determine the punishment of military ransoms on the tribunal. Therefore, the time of its preparation is recorded under each publication. The task of all Ukrainian journalists today is to fix the rates of the aggressor country, victory over misinformation and fakes of hostile propagandists. After all, journalists, like no other, know that the war is waged more than the territory, but also for human souls. And the victory certainly awaits us on these fronts!
