This was emphasized by the Secretaries of National Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexey Danilov in an interview for the Facts of the Week on ICTV on Monday, May 15, 2023.

“Chechnya is occupied by the Russian Federation today. In 2008, Putin committed an act of aggression on a non -volatile Georgia. In the summer of 2014, the Russian Military SPRK BUK destroyed aircraft. In 2014, the Russians invaded our country ... ” - reminded Vavdanilov.

Unfortunately, the NSDC secretary noted, the civilized world then "worried, worried, but did not make any decisions regarding the aggressor country."

To date, he emphasized, "there is no decision on the future of Russia after war" because it "is a hostage of illusions about Russia's power through nuclear potential."

"If someone believes that Russia should stay in the same form in which it is a Blado of War, after our victory, then the question of activation of Russian swinging, imperialism," said Alexei Danilov, adding that then RFProtrotag will succeed in aggression about aggression another country. "They will calm down if they exist within the limits in which they exist," he saved.

“It is about people who either deliberately worked on the aggressor or were forced to do. They are told that hostilities will soon begin, that this territory will be fired and bombed, so they will convince and work with the Russians, ”said Andrey Chernyak, a representative of the RBC-Ukraine.

According to a representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the so-called evacuation of the packed territories of southern Ukraine, Russians use as a screen to carry counterintelligence and filtration measures: “They, first, are bad that the population can observe their preparation for battles-that is, certain counterintelligence measures. It is also filtration, because, first of all, there is a forced export of the pro -Ukrainian population. And thirdly, the Russians are afraid of holding in these territories of some guerrilla movement and internal resistance, ”Andrey Chernyak said.

At the same time a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine [reported](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/zhest-dobroyi-voli-chi-pochali-rosiyani-tikati-1684096645.html)that the removal of Russian combat units from Zaporizhzhya, or from the Kherson regions, is not being recorded. In the occupied territories of these two regions, there are now approximately 152 thousand personnel of enemy troops, and all their actions indicate that they are preparing a pre -defense.

About it in Telegram channel [wrote](https://t.me/annamaliar)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.

- Such reports of the Russian Federation promote its narrative about the military power of the state. It is worth noting that the unchanged information background of the narrative of the Russian Federation remains the coverage of the situation around Bakhmut and other cities with squeezing actions at the front, where, according to authors reports from the Russian Federation, they occupy successful successes, - the message reads.

Anna Malyar also noted that the spread of the above narratives has a certainmet - to hide the fact that in fact Russia is afraid of the Ukrainian contrast. Manipulations in the information space are aimed at creating a mythical image of the invincibility of the Russian superpower and intimidation of the international and Ukrainian community.

“We gathered today against the background of Russian invaders [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna)against Ukraine.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-17T16-00-35-03-00/630_360_1553098741-454.jpg)Goooggle has announced that since December 2023 will start deleting accounts that were inactive for at least two years.

About it reports Ukrinform with reference to the press release of the company.

It is noted that such an innovation is related to the intentions of the company to protect users, because if the account has been unused for a long time, it is likely to be broken.

This is due to the fact that forgotten or uncontrolled accounts are often neoped or re -use passwords that could be broken and tuned for two -factor authentication for them, so the account is undergoing fewer security checks.

** Read also: ** [** Google **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-technology/3707634-google-prezentuvala-tri-novih-pristroi-pixel.html)The internal analysis of the company shows that abandoned accounts are expected 10 times less likely to customize a two -stage check, rather than active accounts. This means that these accounts are often vulnerable, and sometimes the account is compromised, it can be used for something: from theft of personal data to the transfer of unwanted or even harmful content, such as spam, in [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-google).

“To reduce this risk, we update our policy on inactive accounting records from Google to 2 years in all our products.

According to Ukrinform correspondent, Latvia President Egilslevit said in his speech at the Council of Europe Summit in Reykjavik.

"Today, Russia enters a bloody page into European history. Aggressive war is the greatest international crime. Unfortunately, the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction in this case. And this is an unbearable gap in international law," he said.

The Latvian President added that that is why he proposed to create an ad hoc tribunal in Ukraine immediately after a full -scale maintenance of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. "This is necessary for three reasons: first, to distinguish between justice for Ukraine, secondly, to support the standards of international law achieved after the Second World War, which prohibits aggressive wars, and, thirdly, not to undermine confidence in our democratic values," he added.

"It is legally possible. All that is needed is only political will. I urge all over, colleagues, join this initiative," he said.

The Latvian President also stressed that Russia should compensate for Ukraine for all losses during aggression. "And so I congratulate the decision on the creation of registries caused by Russia's aggression against Ukraine," he added.

“No consumer shutdowns are yet planned. Energy stabilizes in the power system by increasing the generation at the TPP of imports of imports during peak hours of consumption, ”the message reads.

Currently, Ukraine is in the regime of dynamic export-import crossings from the EU. This is a common practice for the European continent, when at night, at some hours during the day, the country exports excess [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-elektroenergia), and in the afternoon imports.

According to Sakharuk, the successful integration of Ukraine in ENTSO-E has given our energy system additional flexibility, so that the country can store exports surplus hours and increase imports during peak consumption hours.

This practice will avoid restrictions on the period of repair campaigns on generation.

On the air [television marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The "only news" of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Ignatius reported how the Russian "daggers" were destroyed, aimed at Kiev, so that no one was worried The Patriot SAC in Kiev was struck by a dagger rocket.

- From a technical point of view it is called both complex and division, and is system. But in the same division there is a team point where there is a combat service that, according to the information received about the air situation, works out the enemy's air purposes. In general, Patriot can work in manual, semi -automatic and automatic modes. And it is in automatic mode that depends on the speed of decision -making, the detection of goals and the use of release, hostile missiles were destroyed during a recent massive attack of Nakyiv region, - said Colonel Yuri Ignat.

The spokesman of the Air Force Command of Ukraine also added that the Patriot SCR is a creepy powerful system, whose combat work is also provided by radar and close -sided rocket launchers, which are located at a certain distance. Therefore, it is simply impossible to destroy this anti-aircraft missile complex.

Answering the leading question about the purpose pursued by the Russians during the day -old massive blow to the Kyiv region, the officer replied that thanks to the professional work of our air defense forces about the ultimate goal of the Russians, we did not know, since all the hostile rockets were destroyed in the air.

- If the interception by our means of air defense of the same "dagger" happened in the air, then it is impossible to calculate where it was the enemy. After all, in times the enemy rocket, only a few degrees, its movement can change overweight kilometers. We can only understand that the enemy aimed at our military and infrastructure sites. That is, he tried to impress the goals that united him priority. But what the goals are, we do not know, Borossian missiles did not fly there. And that's very good!- summed up Yuri Ignat.

Ukrainians have received the last introductory to successfully use the Patriot radar for reflecting Russian air strikes.

The purpose of the training was to jointly use the knowledge gained during the classroom training courses, in the still unknown area of action in the maximum realistic conditions. All instructors who trained Ukrainian military service for air defense in different countries were combined together to one country in order to harmonize the level of training.

"We were able to mutually provide optimal training and materials. The Ukrainians are capable of Ukrainians," said the commander of the 21st Anti-aircraft missile group, Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Kenig after successfully completed attestation certification.

Since February 2023, he has been responsible for the training of Ukrainians on the Patriot anti-aircraft missile complex in Germany. His training team was taught a group of Ukrainian military to use the Patriot system for a few weeks, which usually takes 18 months.

The skills were also worked at night to fully prepare the staff of long possible scenarios.

“My servicemen conveyed their knowledge with maximum devotion, despite the parallel deployment in Slovakia and Poland. The Ukrainians, who thought about their families at home, used every minute to use the Patriot tracking radars for safe intercepting goats, ”Marcus Kenig emphasized.

The editions are administered to the masters of the words that were defense of our country both on the information front and on the battlefield. The peculiarity of the book is that the journalists act in it in two hypostases - as authors and as heroes of stories.

The book contains more than 60 essays, combined in six sections, the first of which - "on the leading land" tells of military journalists who serve the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Among them-an essay about our colleague Vladislavoloshin, who saw with his own eyes and described more than ten wars, and when this war began in 2014, he participated in the creation of the ATO press center, he frequently on business trips on the forefront, and now continues to document the Opirals.

The same cover contains materials of different genres: reports, interviews, essays, reviews, as well as photographs and documents. These are the living evidence of eyewitnesses of the content of events and the impression of direct participants in hostilities, experienced work and information resistance.

The book also feeds on other editions that describe the course of large-scale interaction and poems of poet journalists, written after February 24, 2022.

The publication became a kind of continuation of the book that was published in the early 2022 - "Journalists in the War", the compiled by the head of the Kiev organization Mikhail Soroka. There are stories about the events of the Russian-Ukrainian war since 2014. Mikhail Mikhailovich, who was the presenter of the presentation of the book "Ukraine: Journalists on the Advanced", announced the beginning of work on the Thirdtoom, which, convinced, will describe our victory.

The head of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine Serhiy Tomilenko said in his own, 59 Ukrainian journalists were killed in the war, including14 - during his professional duties. One of the books of the book is "Memory". In it, the essays of the died of colleagues and friends-Mikola Kravchenko, Alexander Kuzenkov, Alexei Chubashev, Maxim Levin, Irina Tzvil, Pavel Lee, Dmitry Shipovsky. As well as the material of our colleague Olgimossonz about Dmitry Labutkin's TV studio officer. The attendees were honored with a moment of silence ...

Editor of the Ivanka District Newspaper "Tribune of Labor" in Kyiv region Pavlo Smovzh, ex-editor of the newspaper "Donetskchina" Igor Zots, Professor of the Department of Social Communications of the Educational and Scientific Institute of Journalism that entered the book.

Of course, the presented publication does not claim exhaustiveness - too wide the Jauralist palette of belligerent Ukraine. However, this book contains great masses of specific facts that will be useful for future researchers of the Russian-Ukrainian war and perhaps to those who will determine the punishment of military ransoms on the tribunal. Therefore, the time of its preparation is recorded under each publication. The task of all Ukrainian journalists today is to fix the rates of the aggressor country, victory over misinformation and fakes of hostile propagandists. After all, journalists, like no other, know that the war is waged more than the territory, but also for human souls. And the victory certainly awaits us on these fronts!
