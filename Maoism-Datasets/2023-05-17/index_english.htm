They are told that hostilities will soon begin, that this territory will be fired and bombed, so they will convince and work with the Russians, ”said Andrey Chernyak, a representative of the RBC-Ukraine.</p>
<p>According to a representative of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the so-called evacuation of the packed territories of southern Ukraine, Russians use as a screen to carry counterintelligence and filtration measures: “They, first, are bad that the population can observe their preparation for battles-that is, certain counterintelligence measures. It is also filtration, because, first of all, there is a forced export of the pro -Ukrainian population. And thirdly, the Russians are afraid of holding in these territories of some guerrilla movement and internal resistance, ”Andrey Chernyak said.</p>

Russian TG channels are actively disseminating information about the alleged destruction of batteriepatriot by one rocket "dagger".

<p>About it in Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar">wrote</a>Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Such reports of the Russian Federation promote its narrative about the military power of the state. It is worth noting that the unchanged information background of the narrative of the Russian Federation remains the coverage of the situation around Bakhmut and other cities with squeezing actions at the front, where, according to authors reports from the Russian Federation, they occupy successful successes, - the message reads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anna Malyar also noted that the spread of the above narratives has a certainmet - to hide the fact that in fact Russia is afraid of the Ukrainian contrast. Manipulations in the information space are aimed at creating a mythical image of the invincibility of the Russian superpower and intimidation of the international and Ukrainian community.</p>

<p>It is, in particular, about the head of the Russian government Mikhail Mishustin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov. This was stated in a comment by Ukrinform spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Polishilukash Yasin.</p>
<p>“Poland considers this a significant step towards holding individual criminal responsibility for international senior management crimes <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>, as well as a clear symbolic and legal signal that the ISS can and will take measures against the highest officials of the Russian Federation, including the so -called three, that is, the head of state, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, ”Yasina said.</p>
<p>He noted that in Poland they are aware that there is one category of crimes from which all began - the crime of Russia's aggression against Ukraine - and it lies with the extra -urists of the ISS. Therefore, Poland supports and is working on the creation of a new international court on the crime of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, without a clear indication of the way it is created and authority.</p>

<p>She said this in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"We have concerns about this document, because there is not a very understanding of the advertising of the regional media.

It turns out a conflict that can cause a very large number of regional media. We urge to replace in this article(Articles 13 - Ed.)Definition of "legal entities of Ukraine" on "residents of Ukraine" or to remove this norm at all, " - said IMI Director.</p>
<p>In her opinion, if the bill is approved in its current form, it is negative to the media market, because regional media will not be able to earn Nazi.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-verhovna-rada"></a>On the first reading of the law "On Amendments to the Law of Ukraine" On Advertising "on the Implementation of European Legislation of European Legislation of Ukraine by the implementation of certain provisions of certain provisions of acquisiece in the field of audiovisual advertising in the first reading.(European Convention on Cross -Border Gency, European Parliament Directive and Council 2010/13/EC Provisionalvisual Media Services of March 10, 2010 as amended(EU)2018/1808 dated 14 November 2018)and to some other laws ”(№9206).</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform correspondent, Latvia President Egilslevit said in his speech at the Council of Europe Summit in Reykjavik.</p>
<p>"Today, Russia enters a bloody page into European history. Aggressive war is the greatest international crime. Unfortunately, the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction in this case. And this is an unbearable gap in international law," he said.</p>

<p>“No consumer shutdowns are yet planned. Energy stabilizes in the power system by increasing the generation at the TPP of imports of imports during peak hours of consumption, ”the message reads.</p>
<p>Currently, Ukraine is in the regime of dynamic export-import crossings from the EU. This is a common practice for the European continent, when at night, at some hours during the day, the country exports excess <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-elektroenergia"></a>, and in the afternoon imports.</p>
<p>According to Sakharuk, the successful integration of Ukraine in ENTSO-E has given our energy system additional flexibility, so that the country can store exports surplus hours and increase imports during peak consumption hours.</p>
<p>This practice will avoid restrictions on the period of repair campaigns on generation.</p>

<ul>
<li>From a technical point of view it is called both complex and division, and is system. But in the same division there is a team point where there is a combat service that, according to the information received about the air situation, works out the enemy's air purposes. In general, Patriot can work in manual, semi -automatic and automatic modes. And it is in automatic mode that depends on the speed of decision -making, the detection of goals and the use of release, hostile missiles were destroyed during a recent massive attack of Nakyiv region, - said Colonel Yuri Ignat.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spokesman of the Air Force Command of Ukraine also added that the Patriot SCR is a creepy powerful system, whose combat work is also provided by radar and close -sided rocket launchers, which are located at a certain distance. Therefore, it is simply impossible to destroy this anti-aircraft missile complex.</p>
<p>Answering the leading question about the purpose pursued by the Russians during the day -old massive blow to the Kyiv region, the officer replied that thanks to the professional work of our air defense forces about the ultimate goal of the Russians, we did not know, since all the hostile rockets were destroyed in the air.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the interception by our means of air defense of the same "dagger" happened in the air, then it is impossible to calculate where it was the enemy. After all, in times the enemy rocket, only a few degrees, its movement can change overweight kilometers. We can only understand that the enemy aimed at our military and infrastructure sites. That is, he tried to impress the goals that united him priority. But what the goals are, we do not know, Borossian missiles did not fly there. And that's very good!- summed up Yuri Ignat.</li>

<p>The book contains more than 60 essays, combined in six sections, the first of which - "on the leading land" tells of military journalists who serve the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Among them-an essay about our colleague Vladislavoloshin, who saw with his own eyes and described more than ten wars, and when this war began in 2014, he participated in the creation of the ATO press center, he frequently on business trips on the forefront, and now continues to document the Opirals.</p>

<p>Editor of the Ivanka District Newspaper "Tribune of Labor" in Kyiv region Pavlo Smovzh, ex-editor of the newspaper "Donetskchina" Igor Zots, Professor of the Department of Social Communications of the Educational and Scientific Institute of Journalism that entered the book.</p>
<p>Of course, the presented publication does not claim exhaustiveness - too wide the Jauralist palette of belligerent Ukraine. However, this book contains great masses of specific facts that will be useful for future researchers of the Russian-Ukrainian war and perhaps to those who will determine the punishment of military ransoms on the tribunal. Therefore, the time of its preparation is recorded under each publication. The task of all Ukrainian journalists today is to fix the rates of the aggressor country, victory over misinformation and fakes of hostile propagandists. After all, journalists, like no other, know that the war is waged more than the territory, but also for human souls. And the victory certainly awaits us on these fronts!</p>
