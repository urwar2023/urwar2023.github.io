It is almost twice less than in the corresponding period last year, when Russia was prevailing for a large -scale invasion and the activity of hackers was anomalous high.

About it [reports](https://t.me/dsszzi_official/5647)State Secretariat of Uterticulum.

"With the help of hackers, Russia is trying to get any information that can be advised in the Convention War," the message reads.

[](https://telegra.ph/file/1d07fbce81ccbefea3039.jpg)According to experts, in January 2023, the activity of cyber -refiners was somewhat reduced. This may probably be associated with the enemy New Year holidays. However, the Ulita hackers returned to the usual level of activity.

Since the beginning of this year, an increase in the number of attacks for espionage has been emphasized on the maintenance of constant access to the organization. And even the middle -aged software distributed by Russian hackers is dominated by data collection and remote access to devices.

“It can be one of the signs that Russia is preparing for a long war. She tries to obtain any information that can give preference in the Convention against our country: from mobilization data-to disclosure of the secrets of Western weapons logistics, ”the Dozhaspecs said.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

Today, our National Guard celebrates its day, and it will be right if we thank the National Guard together. For the National Guard, along with all the warriors, he powerfully beat Ukraine. Thank you for the strength and strength of killing for the Donbas. For the defense of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. For the heroic protection of Mariupoli "Azovstal". For fighting in Luhansk region. For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.

Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.

During the large -scale war, almost 5,000 National Guards have been marked by state awards - it is for participation in battles, for bravery, for stability, a slaughter, which is reached by the National Guard. 32 National Guard fighters awarded Hero of Ukraine.

I thank all the Guards: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command!Thank you who helps the National Guard units, who trains the fighters, provides them with them necessary, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation.

The power of Ukraine is the power of all who fight for Ukraine and who helps the soldiers. It is simply impossible to Yuena our state force without the National Guard.

Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special participant. He also held meetings with intelligence.

Defense, strengthening of our protection - both from the external threat, as well as the internal threats. We are preparing our appropriate steps.

Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.

It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.

It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.

He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.

We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.

In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.

Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.

57 Separate Motor Infantry Brigade, 5th Separate Storm Brigade and 93rd Separate Brigade-Well done, boys!Thank you for your power!

Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-all in Donetsk-thank you for being the best in the week!

I also want to celebrate our warriors today, which defend the summary and Chernihiv region. It is also a defense against attempts to start DRG across the border, it is the attachment of Ukraine from air strikes, it is also a protection against terrorists.** _ Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle!_ **

** _ Thank all who help defense!_ **

The Swedish company IKEA has sold its last enterprise in Russia - a furniture factory in the Podbereza Novgorod region. In total, Sweden has built on the Russian Federation of three -factories for the production of furniture, but since the beginning of Russian full -scale aggression against Ukraine decided to leave the Russian Federation completely.

The head of the Gossuum Volodin proposed to change the current legislation in order to conquer the activities of the International Criminal Court in Russia.

The Ministry of Economy of the Russian Federation has closed access to the portal of administrative professionalism and open civil control "Operations", introduced in 2014. Formally, because the authorities provide the Russian Federation with information that only 20-40 % corresponded to their real notes on obtaining statistical information, registers and state -owned bases. On their basis, entrepreneurs in particular were able to adjust their business to inadequate services to citizens.

The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has banned the sale of shares of companies from "unfriendly", according to Russia, countries until October 1, 2023.

More than 52 % of male Russians do not live up to 65 years of age, - said the Chief Specialist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation on reproductive health.

The occupation authorities of Crimea have promised that the Government of the Russian Federation would provide financial assistance to ensure minimum wages to the employees of the tourism industry of the peninsula.

In Russia, there is a shortage of cadaver - corpses on which medical workers study. As a result, the price of cadaver increased by 80-120 %, the accident of training courses by 20-30 %. Currently, Russian companies are trying to adjust the supply of corpses under the scheme of parallel import.

The roselvsky supervision found a dangerous disease - dwarf soot - in seed, imported to Russia from Belarus. The import of almost 5 tons of wheat was debated, the party was returned to the supplier.

Civil infrastructure remains the main purpose of Russian hackers. First, the central authorities. Since the beginning of this year, significant attacks and local governments have been registered(second place in number).

According to the experts of the Government Response Team to Cert-UA, a year ago, the Sector of Security and Defense took the second place a year ago.

Such a high proportion indicates not only that this segment is interesting for the hackers, but also that local authorities are still insufficiently protected by the enemy, which is usually explained by a lack of funds and experts.

Recall that during January-February 2023 the Government Response Team of Cert-UA, which operates at the State Security Service, [worked out](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/03/26/za-dva-misyaczi-v-ukrayini-zafiksuvaly-ponad-300-kiberatak-derzhspeczzvyazku/)More than 300 cyberincidential cyberattacks.

Водночас свій страх загарбники намагаються компенсувати збільшенням кількостівійськової техніки на півострові. Морське узбережжя поступово перетворюють налінію оборони. Тож найімовірніше, що цьогорічний сезон відпочинку в Криму будезірваний.

Тим часом українська влада закликає кримчан бути уважними й обережними, непіддаватися на жодні провокації. За можливості повідомляти про місцеперебування ворога чи його техніку.

Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar on her page in the telegram [told](https://t.me/annamaliar/599)About how not to break out a zapsychological equilibrium, reading messages in the media.

“There are two main types of information in the communication summons of the war:

* News. They are variable and directly dependent on the dynamics of events on the front; * Information relevant throughout the war.

News - retreat/come, have a rocket stroke, fighting, we keep defense, we cause losses, stabilizes the situation, intensified arbitration and more.

But there are things that will not change to the victory, which are specific and which do not need to be perceived as news and frightened every time. Because it is a simple -constitution of the inevitable fact.

For example:

The Russian Federation wants to capture the whole of Ukraine. This is their ultimate goal for our country. They have fallen to us in 2014. Therefore, regardless of the course of combatants, their defeats and unjustifiably large losses, they do not change this purpose. Another thing is that they cannot realize it.

What does it mean to us? What we should allow and consider all possible events in order to be ready to resist any time at any time. Actually, this is what happens.

Any headlines with the assumption of events are not news, but only assumption. All assumptions are entitled to life, but objectively there is only what is happening on the front and what has already happened.

Of all the forecasts of this war, there is only one accurate - we will win it.

The topic of mobilization. Also, no news and relevant until the victory itself. It is worth taking this way.

Objectively mobilization has been ongoing from February 24 to execute the Presidential Decree.

Thanks to the mobilization and high motivation of our people, we have already preserved the state in 2022 and now we will finish the case and release our lands. If you apologize for mobilization, it is the everyday reality of war, not news.

But for the calm perception of realities it is necessary to know that no waves are mobilizing. Everything goes in a planned order. The need for mobilization depends on the development of the situation on the front - these are obvious things, it is not news.

It will also remain a permanent issue of the probability of rocket attacks of fans of Ukraine. Probably everything. Because the war continues. But how should you read the such heads with forecasts?

To understand that no one knows 100% how it will be.To know that Ukraine works with our partners to maximize the sky.

We have become a very adult society this year. We have learned to critically accept any information, we courageously tolerate the most tragic news and is quite difficult to knock out the collective psychological balance of media reports from the collective psychological equilibrium.

But this condition should be constantly maintained and not panic, fears and betrayal - because we still win the war, ”Anna Malyar wrote.

He also added that a year ago, no one would have thought that the support of partners would be so powerful. That the whole civilized world will restart and resist the bloody aggressor, the country-terrorist of the Russian Federation.

Everything has changed during this year. Ukraine has changed the world.

The stability of the Ukrainian people and the skill of our army convinced that Ukraine would win.

“And we are already winning. After all, the "special operation" of the orcs goes "according to the plan" - they dig ops and try to strengthen. In their heads, they have already changed the paradigm "we are the second army of the world and we will win you in three days" to "We need to cross the Vaboron", - says Alexei Reznikov.

According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, a great way has been traveled. And a lot of chiefs. All our cities will be liberated and we will go to borders, internationally recognized in 1991. And this new technique will make a good company for its "brothers" on the battlefield.

Soon its advantages, thanks to our military, will feel Russian.

Always first!

“By the way, after a personal" piloting "Challenger, as a participant in trophies, I can say that even the Rols Royce driver will not be in such comfort, the qualification of this work of martial art on the road.

So, in the dry residue: our "military zoo" is expanding. And "Elephant" joined the "battle". This is how our paratroopers called the Challenger, ”Alexei Reznikov said.

He just spent the meeting - for the first time on the departure, in the Dnieper. It is here, that the urban city of our country, after visiting manganese and Nikopol, Zaporozhye, the leading positions of our soldiers in the Zaporozhye region.

Operational directions have reported the actual situation. General -General, General Tarnavsky - they were personally. Those who head the defense of the Nadonechyna in the hottest directions. There were also online reports of the commander, which cover the south and north. There was a report by the head and others.

By the way, I want to thank the soldiers of our intelligence for their powerful work today. The Kraken unit, as always, at the height. Well done guys!

They discussed the general situation in the frontal areas, the fortification and protection of our borders along the entire length of the front - from Kherson region to Kharkiv region.

Each commander understands that the enemy must be responsible for every blow to our locations and villages, on our people. For Sloviansk, for Konstantinovka and Druzhkivka, for Avdiivka and Toretsk, for all the pain of Ukrainians-and not only during the full-scale war, but also during the 14th year.

The Dnieper has been our fortress for over nine years, and has been supporting the front of fighters all this time. It was here, in the Dnieper, from the 14th of the age of thousands of our soldiers saved health after injuries. The Dnieper concentrated the work of volunteers-from the first escape of aggression in the 14th year.

I thank you, Dnipro, thank everyone here and everyone in the city, who helps Ukraine to stand, stand firmly and beat the occupier.

Today in Zaporizhzhya there was a hit by Russian rockets in residential buildings in the city. Ordinary houses ... Unfortunately, partially burned.

Dozens of people were injured by this crazy Russian blow. Terrorists accurately where the rockets were directed. Sliding-fugitive "tornadoes". On houses.37 people were injured, two were killed. My condolences to those who have lost their relatives and closely…

More than 400 people have sought help.

Of course, Russia will be responsible for this blow. For this purpose, we will work with international justice, mobilizing the world for creating a sp specifications on Russia's aggression. All this will be. The sentences will be terrorists.

Of course, we help those who have lost their home from this and similar blows. Local authorities and partners have a resource in order to give people priority assistance. And I thank everyone who quickly and without unnecessary bureaucracy implements relevant programs.I visited today our fighters at the hospital, where they are being restored. I thank every doctor, every nurse, all volunteers who help save the fighters.

He met with the leader Raphael Grosssey. The topic is clear: safety energy, our nuclear power plants. First of all, the Zaporizhzhya NPP, which Rosias uses for radiation blackmail in the world. No other terrorist has undergone in his cynicism to such depths in which Russia is constantly looking for a new bottom.

Keeping hostages for over a year is the worst thing that has happened in the history of European and world atomic energy. I thank our partners, thank Grossi to understand this and for the support of Ukraine in the relevant matters.

And one more.

We are already preparing for an important international event that will take place this week with a concern for President Baiden and the United States. The summit for democracy. Ukraine will participate. Our position in support of freedom will sound, always, firmly.

Thank you to everyone who helps our country to protect freedom!

Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine!

I thank all our people in Zaporozhye, in Manganese, in Nikopol, in the Dnieper, in all the locations that Russia wants to destroy so much and who stand so firmly!

** _ together we will win ._ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**
