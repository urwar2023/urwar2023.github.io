For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.
Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.
During the large -scale war, almost 5,000 National Guards have been marked by state awards - it is for participation in battles, for bravery, for stability, a slaughter, which is reached by the National Guard. 32 National Guard fighters awarded Hero of Ukraine.
I thank all the Guards: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command!Thank you who helps the National Guard units, who trains the fighters, provides them with them necessary, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation.

Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.
It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.
It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.
He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.
We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.
In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.
Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.
57 Separate Motor Infantry Brigade, 5th Separate Storm Brigade and 93rd Separate Brigade-Well done, boys!Thank you for your power!
Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-all in Donetsk-thank you for being the best in the week!
I also want to celebrate our warriors today, which defend the summary and Chernihiv region. It is also a defense against attempts to start DRG across the border, it is the attachment of Ukraine from air strikes, it is also a protection against terrorists. _ Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle!_

Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar on her page in the telegram told About how not to break out a zapsychological equilibrium, reading messages in the media.
“There are two main types of information in the communication summons of the war:
News - retreat/come, have a rocket stroke, fighting, we keep defense, we cause losses, stabilizes the situation, intensified arbitration and more.
But there are things that will not change to the victory, which are specific and which do not need to be perceived as news and frightened every time. Because it is a simple -constitution of the inevitable fact.
For example:
The Russian Federation wants to capture the whole of Ukraine. This is their ultimate goal for our country. They have fallen to us in 2014. Therefore, regardless of the course of combatants, their defeats and unjustifiably large losses, they do not change this purpose. Another thing is that they cannot realize it.
What does it mean to us? What we should allow and consider all possible events in order to be ready to resist any time at any time. Actually, this is what happens.
Any headlines with the assumption of events are not news, but only assumption. All assumptions are entitled to life, but objectively there is only what is happening on the front and what has already happened.
Of all the forecasts of this war, there is only one accurate - we will win it.
The topic of mobilization. Also, no news and relevant until the victory itself. It is worth taking this way.
Objectively mobilization has been ongoing from February 24 to execute the Presidential Decree.
Thanks to the mobilization and high motivation of our people, we have already preserved the state in 2022 and now we will finish the case and release our lands. If you apologize for mobilization, it is the everyday reality of war, not news.
But for the calm perception of realities it is necessary to know that no waves are mobilizing. Everything goes in a planned order. The need for mobilization depends on the development of the situation on the front - these are obvious things, it is not news.
It will also remain a permanent issue of the probability of rocket attacks of fans of Ukraine. Probably everything. Because the war continues. But how should you read the such heads with forecasts?
To understand that no one knows 100% how it will be.To know that Ukraine works with our partners to maximize the sky.
We have become a very adult society this year. We have learned to critically accept any information, we courageously tolerate the most tragic news and is quite difficult to knock out the collective psychological balance of media reports from the collective psychological equilibrium.
But this condition should be constantly maintained and not panic, fears and betrayal - because we still win the war, ”Anna Malyar wrote.

So, in the dry residue: our "military zoo" is expanding. And "Elephant" joined the "battle". This is how our paratroopers called the Challenger, ”Alexei Reznikov said.

Operational directions have reported the actual situation. General -General, General Tarnavsky - they were personally. Those who head the defense of the Nadonechyna in the hottest directions. There were also online reports of the commander, which cover the south and north. There was a report by the head and others.
By the way, I want to thank the soldiers of our intelligence for their powerful work today. The Kraken unit, as always, at the height. Well done guys!
They discussed the general situation in the frontal areas, the fortification and protection of our borders along the entire length of the front - from Kherson region to Kharkiv region.
Each commander understands that the enemy must be responsible for every blow to our locations and villages, on our people. For Sloviansk, for Konstantinovka and Druzhkivka, for Avdiivka and Toretsk, for all the pain of Ukrainians-and not only during the full-scale war, but also during the 14th year.
The Dnieper has been our fortress for over nine years, and has been supporting the front of fighters all this time. It was here, in the Dnieper, from the 14th of the age of thousands of our soldiers saved health after injuries. The Dnieper concentrated the work of volunteers-from the first escape of aggression in the 14th year.
I thank you, Dnipro, thank everyone here and everyone in the city, who helps Ukraine to stand, stand firmly and beat the occupier.
Today in Zaporizhzhya there was a hit by Russian rockets in residential buildings in the city. Ordinary houses ... Unfortunately, partially burned.
Dozens of people were injured by this crazy Russian blow. Terrorists accurately where the rockets were directed. Sliding-fugitive "tornadoes". On houses.37 people were injured, two were killed. My condolences to those who have lost their relatives and closely…
More than 400 people have sought help.
Of course, Russia will be responsible for this blow. For this purpose, we will work with international justice, mobilizing the world for creating a sp specifications on Russia's aggression. All this will be. The sentences will be terrorists.
Of course, we help those who have lost their home from this and similar blows. Local authorities and partners have a resource in order to give people priority assistance.

He met with the leader Raphael Grosssey. The topic is clear: safety energy, our nuclear power plants. First of all, the Zaporizhzhya NPP, which Rosias uses for radiation blackmail in the world. No other terrorist has undergone in his cynicism to such depths in which Russia is constantly looking for a new bottom.
Keeping hostages for over a year is the worst thing that has happened in the history of European and world atomic energy. I thank our partners, thank Grossi to understand this and for the support of Ukraine in the relevant matters.
And one more.
