Законопроєктом передбачається визначення на законодавчому рівні поняття«адаптивний спорт» як діяльності суб’єктів сфери фізичної культури і спорту,спрямованої на залучення осіб з інвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнямиповсякденного функціонування до занять фізичною культурою і спортом з метоюсприяння інклюзії та інтеграції до суспільства, фізичній, психологічнійреабілітації, сприяння можливості ведення самостійного способу життя тазалученості до місцевої спільноти, а також окреслити його як напрям фізичноїкультури.
Запропонований напрям фізичної культури підвищить адаптацію осіб зінвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнями повсякденного функціонування до умов життя,що змінилися, розширить їхні функціональні можливості, сприятиме відновленнюфізичного та ментального здоров’я, реінтеграції зазначеної категорії осіб досуспільства під час та у післявоєнний період, поверненню відчуття соціальноїповноцінності.
Безбар’єрність — це не просто про комфортне життя для всіх груп населення, аіноді про життя взагалі, про розвиток. Бар’єри, які існують сьогодні всуспільстві — фізичні, громадянські, освітні економічні та інші — недозволяють мільйонам українцям, серед яких маломобільні люди, молодь, жінки,люди літнього віку, реалізувати себе.
Відновлення України, її фізичного і загалом суспільного простору, даєможливість виправити ці помилки минулого, зокрема однією з основних з яких єбар’єри між різними суспільними групами — фізичні, громадянські, освітні,економічні тощо.

In Ukraine, the circulation of medicines that are constantly realized. And we expect that the adoption of this law is also to build a link to international companies that Ukraine is ready for the introduction of such medical means, and the share of international companies will also begin to register their own medical means in the territory of Ukraine. If such drugs are provided in humanitarian aid, it is quite possible because it is possible to use unregistered drugs for emergency response to emergency situations.

Він нагадав, що свого часу, у 2008 році на Бухарестському саміті НАТО, Україніі Грузії відмовили в наданні ПДЧ.
Так само, у 2021 році, напередодні війни, коли Президент України наполягав, аукраїнська дипломатія активно закликала наших партнерів щодо надання ПДЧ, небуло відповіді.
"Зараз ПДЧ вже не актуальне, ми вже подолали цей рівень. Це ілюстрація якийпрогрес зроблено, яка динаміка. Динаміка позитивна – ми неухильно інаполегливо рухаємося до членства в НАТО", - сказав Фесенко.
Він зауважив, що умови завершення війни, безумовно, теж будуть впливати натемпи і характер вступу, але на його думку, за останні півтора рокиповномасштабної війни і, зокрема, на Вільнюському саміті, вже зроблено вагомийкрок на шляху до НАТО.

This rocket, an expert added, can be applied for any purpose, even surely bunker fortifications, depending on which charge will be put: "Then it penetrates deep and can undermine quite powerful fortifications. , for example, talk about Crimea, any point. The Kerch Bridge will be under our wad control. "
Read also: France will transmit long -range missiles to Ukraine SCalp According to him, this is what Ukraine wanted in terms of roundabout. "After 500 kilometers, we will have enough to destroy combat warehouses, logistics centers of the enemy. We used to do it, but we did not have a weapon that shot at such a distance. And now with the British Storm Shadow RocketsCalp will be in handy ... when French The missiles will come(Or maybe already arrived)To our Armed Forces, we will see the efficiency very quickly, " - said Hetman.
He added that Scalp is little different from Storm Shadow: "Because it is a have been a program, it can be said that scalp is a modified Storm Shadow, British-French-made production."
Hetman also said that the Russians try to keep large warehouses with weapons from the front line. "Although it is quite difficult for them, because when folded for 300-400 kilometers from the front line, it takes a few days to interrupt the available weapons and equipment to the front. However It will be difficult for the Russians to keep something in the departure, ”the military expert said.Also one of the important areas of attention of the Armed Forces, the Hetman continued, there is Crimea: "Now, having such a long -range weapon, we can keep the whole territory of Crimea under fire control. The Azov Sea, thanks to the realities towards Melitopol, Berdyansk, the Crimea will remain in a conditionally open position - on the land he will connect with the mainland of Russia. It will only remain "Crimean" bridge, which is also most likely to be built, and then the Russian military group will It will be in a conditional point. "
According to the expert, the Storm Shadow I Scalp missiles that can be used by Ukrainian bombers should be adapted so that they can be launched. "There are certain technological nuances that are treated. However, the rocket is already adapted: in NATO countries that were once Uzarashav's Treaty, many Soviet aircraft, and when the Khiraines joined the Alliance, something had to be done to use the Nativ weapons from these aircraft. It has been done, so these rockets for such polyaches, as they could and so, are adapted. There are certain designs that are attached to such lifts, and then this rocket can be used, " - summed up the expert.
As reported by Ukrinform, the President France Emmanuel Macron declared on the first day of the NATO summit that France would convey to Ukraine missiles of SCalp, which is analogous to British SHADOW.

 The parliamentary and presidential elections will definitely take place in Ukraine after the end of the war.
The deputy head of the "Servant of the People" faction in the Verkhovna Rada Yevgeniakravchuk said in interview Ukrinform .
She said that the issue of elections was discussed at a meeting of the Parliamentary Fraction "Servant of the People" in the context of their impossibility of holding them during the military.
"Somewhere in January there was an offline binding of the faction where David Arahamia(the head of the Parliamentary faction of "Servant of the People")very clearly explained why it is impossible to take elections during martial law . He also told what the challenges we have to overcome for the first post -war elections, " - said the People's Deputy.
Kravchuk specified that there are at least two key calls. First, a lot of Ukrainians went abroad. After the war, they will not return home for several days. According to her, it is difficult to organize polling stations abroad, because there are millions of Ukrainians there are a "huge" strain of consulates. Secondly, many infrastructure entities are destroyed in Ukraine, where elections are usually held(educational institutions, gyms, cultural houses). Відповідно необхідно створити нові дільниці в інших місцях.
Водночас депутатка додала: "Один із гіпотетичних варіантів для тих, хто закордоном – онлайн-голосування, але це питання дуже "сире", нічого не можнасказати. У Ванкувері у нашої делегації була зустріч з головою Місії Бюродемократичних інститутів і прав людини ОБСЄ зі спостереження за виборами. Вонисказали, що готові надати Україні експертизу щодо плюсів і мінусів онлайн-виборів. Також вони зазначили, що процес організації таких виборів бутипоступовим. Не можна запровадити цю систему одразу на всю країну. Ми маємовислухати всю експертизу".
At the same time, Kravchuk emphasized that now online chosen is just an option, and the results of their results should be the trust of society, and Ukrainians "so far from such different changes are mostly distrustful."
According to the Constitution, the next regular parliamentary elections should take place in October 2023, and presidential in the spring of 2024. However, the effect of the Ukrainian state of the legal regime of martial law makes it impossible to carry out elections.
According to Ukrinform, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk repeatedly declared that elections in Ukraine should take place after the war was completed.

 On July 11, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a decision on the CMU Resolution No. 1275 of November 11, 2022 “Some Issues of Defense Procurement for the Period of the Legal Regime of the Military Stan”, which will soon be published.
In this decision, part of the Ministry of Defense's proposals in the interests of defense capabilities was supported, namely, justice was partially restored against Ukrainian suppliers of goods, works and services for defense needs. The sophisticated Ukrainian business will be equal in rights with a foreign business, as a defense department. This will ensure predictability, rhythm of supply and payment under contracts(contracts).
Про це йдеться у матеріалі on the official website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
In particular, the Cabinet of Ministers has determined that as part of the value(prices)goods, works and services to meet the needs of the security and defense sector(Supply reward)performer.
“Formally protecting the interests of Ukrainian business is not a responsibility of the Ministers Defense. But only formally. Because the stable work of Ukrainian state and private suppliers of weapons, equipment, ammunition, objects of support is the direct interest of the Armed Forces and other components of defense forces. By protecting Ukrainian business, we protect the interests of defense. This is overwhelming sovereignty, our margin of strength. We need more Ukrainian weapons. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense consistently advocates that the Ukrainian business is developing, increasing production capacity. We simplify administrative processes, created a special mechanism - the MOU accelerator to quickly conduct OVT developers with bureaucratic slums. Thanks to this, we already have a durable dynamics for UAV production, we are already fully provided by the Army of Army helmets, bulletproof vests, basic positions of real property. Therefore, I considered and consider the requirements of the State Judicial Service to actually put the interests of foreign producers higher than Ukrainian and deprive the Ukrainian business right to profit. There is no logic in this, it is directly intensified by the interests of defense and the norms of the current legislation, ” - said Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov.The requirements of the State Judicial Service, which are considered by the Ministry of Defense, are unambiguous and appealed in court, with respect to the recovery of the funds specified as a profit from the Ukrainian business that cooperated with the sector and safety from the beginning of the legal regime of martial law.
This creates the conditions for violation of the stable work of Ukrainian producers there is a negative impact on the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.
“Unfortunately, government colleagues, including those whose direct duty is to protect the Ukrainian economy, have not supported the position of the Defense Ministry in part, which is being restored to the restoration of justice since the beginning of martial law. For example, the defendants are current contracts with the leaders of the Ukrainian OPC, which end in 20124-25. We have hundreds of current contracts with Ukrainian producers this year. How to be with them? How to be with those that have already been fulfilled? The possibility of double interpretation of norms and pressure on business. Mindobors with this approach does not agree, so we will continue to challenge the approval of the State Judicial Service to law enforcement in court, ” - said the Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov.
