<p>The participants of the meeting noted that since July 3, the information and communication system "Reserve for the Civil Service in the Deoccued Territories" was launched. On the platform <a href="http://reserve.nads.gov.ua/">reserve.nads.gov.ua</a>Anyone can fill the lock and become part of the personnel reserve.</p>

<p>Citizens can choose the region on their own. Almost 80% of them choose Crimea. However, other areas are noted: Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>In addition to the restoration of public authorities, it is also important to provide medical services in the liberated territories. The Ministry of Health is currently finalizing the electronic register of workers who are ready to work there.</p>
<p>The challenges that will occur after de -occupation are also concerned with education. First, it is about the return of children to the national education system, as well as the proportion of relevant documents obtained for the DOT.</p>

" About it reports <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/kabinetom-ministriv-skhvaleno-proekt-zakonu-ukrainy-shchodo-rozvytku-adaptyvnoho-sportu">government portal</a>.</p>
<p>Законопроєктом передбачається визначення на законодавчому рівні поняття«адаптивний спорт» як діяльності суб’єктів сфери фізичної культури і спорту,спрямованої на залучення осіб з інвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнямиповсякденного функціонування до занять фізичною культурою і спортом з метоюсприяння інклюзії та інтеграції до суспільства, фізичній, психологічнійреабілітації, сприяння можливості ведення самостійного способу життя тазалученості до місцевої спільноти, а також окреслити його як напрям фізичноїкультури.</p>
<p>Запропонований напрям фізичної культури підвищить адаптацію осіб зінвалідністю чи осіб з обмеженнями повсякденного функціонування до умов життя,що змінилися, розширить їхні функціональні можливості, сприятиме відновленнюфізичного та ментального здоров’я, реінтеграції зазначеної категорії осіб досуспільства під час та у післявоєнний період, поверненню відчуття соціальноїповноцінності.</p>
<p>Безбар’єрність — це не просто про комфортне життя для всіх груп населення, аіноді про життя взагалі, про розвиток. Бар’єри, які існують сьогодні всуспільстві — фізичні, громадянські, освітні економічні та інші — недозволяють мільйонам українцям, серед яких маломобільні люди, молодь, жінки,люди літнього віку, реалізувати себе.</p>
<p>Відновлення України, її фізичного і загалом суспільного простору, даєможливість виправити ці помилки минулого, зокрема однією з основних з яких єбар’єри між різними суспільними групами — фізичні, громадянські, освітні,економічні тощо.</p>
<p>Створення безбар’єрного простору під патронатом першої леді Олени Зеленської зкожним днем наближає Україну до європейських стандартів безбар’єрності.</p>

<p>"The use of medical cannabis, medicines based on it is elaborated world practice. Ukraine is not the first to decide that medical cannabis products should be in the pharmaceutical market. 56 countries have decided to use the use Regulating the circulation of the plant shell will essentially help Ukraine to create conditions for our patients to have an access to medical cannabis and hemp preparations for use in cover, "Kuzin said.</p>

<p>"The relevant national protocols of reporting groups of diseases: neurological, drug addiction, mental, palliative care or chronic pain should be adapted and updated.

Growing medical cannabis in Ukraine is additional workplaces, it is the development of a pharmaceutical sector, production, and the bill stimulates it, ”Kuzin said.</p>
<p>If a dosage form or a ready -made medicinal product will appear, he added, then the appropriate procedure of registration will be carried out and this drug can be on the market.</p>
<p>The Chief State Sanitary Doctor noted: "As long as the Ukrainian pharmaceutical producer is undergoing such registration, it will be possible to temporarily use preparations of foreign production that are used in the world. And, accordingly, they have a registration or FDA(Food Drug Administration), or other regulator of a patient of Europe or the world. The availability of drugs will depend on factors. In Ukraine, the circulation of medicines that are constantly realized. And we expect that the adoption of this law is also to build a link to international companies that Ukraine is ready for the introduction of such medical means, and the share of international companies will also begin to register their own medical means in the territory of Ukraine. If such drugs are provided in humanitarian aid, it is quite possible because it is possible to use unregistered drugs for emergency response to emergency situations. In fact, there are many, but with the adoption of this law, it will be a significant impetus, including the Grand of the World Phamsh Community. "The updated version of the Law on the Legalization of Medical Cannabis in Ukraine provides for increased control of the National Police in circulation of the corresponding drugs.</p>

<p>The political scientist, chairman of the Board of Center for Applied Political Studies "Penta" Volodymyr Fesenko said this in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"We received less than hoped. Although most experts, experts preceded that Ukraine's invitation to NATO during the war <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato">NATO</a>. For the first time, Ukraine and NATO were working on this level. The results are quite positive.

<p>"War is the main obstacle. Since NATO is afraid that Ukraine's accession will mean NATO's involvement in the war against Russia, which is a risk warfare," the expert said.</p>
<p>He also said a number of reforms.</p>
<p>"We still have SBU reforms, some other institutional reforms that are related to NATO accession, but it is not the main thing. It is rather formal and they are not crucial. Now the main problem is this," Fesenko said.</p>

<p>Also, he said, it is very important that Ukraine does not have to perform plans for NATO membership actions(Chipboard). За його словами, Україна таким чиномвпритул наближається до вступу в Альянс.</p>
<p>"Нам не треба буде виконувати, крім деяких технічних реформ, і узгоджуватиокремі програми, що може тягнутися роками", - сказав Фесенко.</p>
<p>Він нагадав, що свого часу, у 2008 році на Бухарестському саміті НАТО, Україніі Грузії відмовили в наданні ПДЧ.</p>
<p>Так само, у 2021 році, напередодні війни, коли Президент України наполягав, аукраїнська дипломатія активно закликала наших партнерів щодо надання ПДЧ, небуло відповіді.</p>
<p>"Зараз ПДЧ вже не актуальне, ми вже подолали цей рівень. Це ілюстрація якийпрогрес зроблено, яка динаміка. Динаміка позитивна – ми неухильно інаполегливо рухаємося до членства в НАТО", - сказав Фесенко.</p>
<p>Він зауважив, що умови завершення війни, безумовно, теж будуть впливати натемпи і характер вступу, але на його думку, за останні півтора рокиповномасштабної війни і, зокрема, на Вільнюському саміті, вже зроблено вагомийкрок на шляху до НАТО.</p>

<p>“This document is open and enables other G7 countries to not be attached to security guarantees. The Declaration is the first document that symbolizes the content of "umbrellas" in the form of security guarantees. It is important that we won the war in 2024 before the NATOU Summit and signed security guarantees for our country. They will act before the entry into <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato">NATO</a>», - said the head of the OP.</p>
<p>He stressed that the agreed declaration was a great result, which was overwhelmed by the multi -year daily work of our team at the level of advisers to the national security of the US, Great Britain, France and Germany, and in communication with other partners.</p>
<p>"I consider this result an important victory for Ukraine on the way to NATO," - assured.</p>
<p>He explained that the G7 declaration is a common product that takes into account both the needs of Ukraine and the capabilities of the Allies. It would be impossible without a huge work and fundamental training of allies teams.</p>
<p>“The declaration itself is a framework general document. The next step is to conclude bilateral security agreements between Ukraine and individual guarantors, united by the framework of multilateral interaction, ”the head of state told the head.</p>
<p>Thus, according to him, the key thesis of the Declaration is the confirmation of the fact that Ukraine is part of the safety of the Euro -Atlantic region and this thesis is referred to the mention of the future of Ukraine's membership in NATO.</p>
<p>At the same time, he informed that security guarantees include assisting Ukraine in protecting themselves and preventing new aggression, including the supply of weapons, support in the development of defense, training, and cooperation in the field of reconnaissance. In addition, garants will help to increase the stability of the Ukrainian economy and energy and provide technical and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Yermak noted that the declaration contains measures in the event of new aggression, which provide immediate consultations to provide Ukraine with everything necessary for the defense in the shortest possible time.He explained that the document also provides support in the prosecution of references for aggression and steps of economic and legal nature aimed at punishing the Russian Federation and increasing its costs for war, among which the more increased sanction pressure, freezing of assets, creation of mechanisms of recovery of reparations and judicial prosecution Ukraine and Ukrainians in accordance with the rules of international law.</p>

<p>This predicted <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101835">Ukrainian radio</a>Military analyst Alexeygetman, commenting on information about the transmission of France to Ukraine SCalp, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"These are air base missiles that can fly more than 500 kilometers. There is information about 560 and even up to 600 kilometers. It is a winged rocket launcher, but maneuvene, flies at low altitude-30-40 meters. The part in it is 450 a meter, that is, it is powerful, " - said the hetman.</p>
<p>This rocket, an expert added, can be applied for any purpose, even surely bunker fortifications, depending on which charge will be put: "Then it penetrates deep and can undermine quite powerful fortifications. , for example, talk about Crimea, any point. The Kerch Bridge will be under our wad control. "</p>

"After 500 kilometers, we will have enough to destroy combat warehouses, logistics centers of the enemy. We used to do it, but we did not have a weapon that shot at such a distance. And now with the British Storm Shadow RocketsCalp will be in handy ... when French The missiles will come(Or maybe already arrived)To our Armed Forces, we will see the efficiency very quickly, " - said Hetman.</p>
<p>He added that Scalp is little different from Storm Shadow: "Because it is a have been a program, it can be said that scalp is a modified Storm Shadow, British-French-made production."</p>
<p>Hetman also said that the Russians try to keep large warehouses with weapons from the front line. "Although it is quite difficult for them, because when folded for 300-400 kilometers from the front line, it takes a few days to interrupt the available weapons and equipment to the front. However It will be difficult for the Russians to keep something in the departure, ”the military expert said.Also one of the important areas of attention of the Armed Forces, the Hetman continued, there is Crimea: "Now, having such a long -range weapon, we can keep the whole territory of Crimea under fire control. The Azov Sea, thanks to the realities towards Melitopol, Berdyansk, the Crimea will remain in a conditionally open position - on the land he will connect with the mainland of Russia. It will only remain "Crimean" bridge, which is also most likely to be built, and then the Russian military group will It will be in a conditional point. "</p>
<p>According to the expert, the Storm Shadow I Scalp missiles that can be used by Ukrainian bombers should be adapted so that they can be launched. "There are certain technological nuances that are treated. However, the rocket is already adapted: in NATO countries that were once Uzarashav's Treaty, many Soviet aircraft, and when the Khiraines joined the Alliance, something had to be done to use the Nativ weapons from these aircraft. It has been done, so these rockets for such polyaches, as they could and so, are adapted. There are certain designs that are attached to such lifts, and then this rocket can be used, " - summed up the expert.</p>

<p>The deputy head of the "Servant of the People" faction in the Verkhovna Rada Yevgeniakravchuk said in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3734996-evgenia-kravcuk-zastupnica-golovi-parlamentskoi-frakcii-sluga-narodu.html"></a><a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3734996-evgenia-kravcuk-zastupnica-golovi-parlamentskoi-frakcii-sluga-narodu.html">interview</a><a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3734996-evgenia-kravcuk-zastupnica-golovi-parlamentskoi-frakcii-sluga-narodu.html">Ukrinform</a>.</p>
<p>She said that the issue of elections was discussed at a meeting of the Parliamentary Fraction "Servant of the People" in the context of their impossibility of holding them during the military.</p>
<p>"Somewhere in January there was an offline binding of the faction where David Arahamia(the head of the Parliamentary faction of "Servant of the People")very clearly explained why it is impossible to take elections during <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-voennij-stan">martial law</a>. He also told what the challenges we have to overcome for the first post -war elections, " - said the People's Deputy.</p>
<p>Kravchuk specified that there are at least two key calls. First, a lot of Ukrainians went abroad. After the war, they will not return home for several days. According to her, it is difficult to organize polling stations abroad, because there are millions of Ukrainians there are a "huge" strain of consulates. Secondly, many infrastructure entities are destroyed in Ukraine, where elections are usually held(educational institutions, gyms, cultural houses). Відповідно необхідно створити нові дільниці в інших місцях.</p>
<p>Водночас депутатка додала: "Один із гіпотетичних варіантів для тих, хто закордоном – онлайн-голосування, але це питання дуже "сире", нічого не можнасказати. У Ванкувері у нашої делегації була зустріч з головою Місії Бюродемократичних інститутів і прав людини ОБСЄ зі спостереження за виборами. Вонисказали, що готові надати Україні експертизу щодо плюсів і мінусів онлайн-виборів. Також вони зазначили, що процес організації таких виборів бутипоступовим. Не можна запровадити цю систему одразу на всю країну. Ми маємовислухати всю експертизу".</p>
<p>At the same time, Kravchuk emphasized that now online chosen is just an option, and the results of their results should be the trust of society, and Ukrainians "so far from such different changes are mostly distrustful."</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, the next regular parliamentary elections should take place in October 2023, and presidential in the spring of 2024. However, the effect of the Ukrainian state of the legal regime of martial law makes it impossible to carry out elections.</p>
<p>According to Ukrinform, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk repeatedly declared that elections in Ukraine should take place after the war was completed.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor Igor Kuzin, said this in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"The use of medical cannabis, medicines based on it is elaborated world practice. Ukraine is not the first to decide that medical cannabis products should be in the pharmaceutical market. 56 countries have decided to use the use Regulating the circulation of the plant shell will essentially help Ukraine to create conditions for our patients to have an access to medical cannabis and hemp preparations for use in cover, "Kuzin said.</p>

Chronic pain, which is difficult to treat standard treatment protocols, palliative help relief of symptoms, especially for cancer patients who are in the last phase of the disease. Therefore, drugs based on medical cannabis can be observed for a very wide group of patients, "Kuzin explained.</p>
<p>He stressed that the really resin of cannabis, extracts containing tetrahydrocanabinol, is a narcotic drug, but the law regulates the muscular supervision of the circulation of such drugs.</p>

<p>If a dosage form or a ready -made medicinal product will appear, he added, then the appropriate procedure of registration will be carried out and this drug can be on the market.</p>
<p>The Chief State Sanitary Doctor noted: "As long as the Ukrainian pharmaceutical producer is undergoing such registration, it will be possible to temporarily use preparations of foreign production that are used in the world. And, accordingly, they have a registration or FDA(Food Drug Administration), or other regulator of a patient of Europe or the world. The availability of drugs will depend on factors. In Ukraine, the circulation of medicines that are constantly realized. And we expect that the adoption of this law is also to build a link to international companies that Ukraine is ready for the introduction of such medical means, and the share of international companies will also begin to register their own medical means in the territory of Ukraine. If such drugs are provided in humanitarian aid, it is quite possible because it is possible to use unregistered drugs for emergency response to emergency situations. In fact, there are many, but with the adoption of this law, it will be a significant impetus, including the Grand of the World Phamsh Community. "The updated version of the Law on the Legalization of Medical Cannabis in Ukraine provides for increased control of the National Police in circulation of the corresponding drugs.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-12T26-00-00-04-00/golovna-16.jpg" />The Army Information Agency continues to talk about partners of Ukraine in the West, which help us in the fight against Russian invaders. This material will be discussed about_ <em>eurov</em> _ companion_ <em>atlas</em> <em>, how to produce UAV</em> <em>atlasPro</em> _ <em>. From the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Prandevels, drones have been used by Ukrainian military personnel Napoli battle.</em></p>
<p>_Bo cooperation with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, that it motivates_evrevis to help our country, said CEO</p>
<h3><strong> "Allowing our drone we received in two days of a pre -wing -scale invasion" </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>I have an aviamic education, from an early age I was engaged in air models - he worked, built. And I have a pilot license… It turned out that I worked as a Vizrail company, we were engaged in large drones. He tried to find himself, wanted to build a drone, but under my projects they had a money. I was a young specialist and even then thought that the future was still upset unmanned unmanned systems, - says Ivan.</li>
</ul>
<p>He remembers that his first drone atlas did for friends:</p>
<ul>
<li>We loved skiing and wanted to shoot it. It is clear that he was done with a handicraft method, he fell every day, I repaired it daily to fly "fly" ... Here we "flew" in the mountains, I laid out a video on YouTube, the name called one person and said that I would give me a million dollars to give me. He opened his drone production company. I then moved Izrael to Europe. Then they found the next investor and the right went.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-12T26-00-00-04-00/jtjtjrtr.jpg" />Atlas CEO says that his company has long wanted to work with our Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am from Ukraine myself, and another person in the company is too. We were given the first opportunity to work work three years ago when the European Commission said that we were able to supply drones to Ukraine. In England, we met the Ukrainian Tairechery, and he handed over our contacts to the Armed Forces to the Armed Forces. We later went to Ukraine, showed our product and heard that we were ready to cooperate with us, an altreb, so that the drone was officially admitted. And this requires changes to its design. We made changes a year. After that, they went to the supra -state commission and spent another year to get the admission. We were allowed two days before Russia's large -scale invasion of Russia, - Ivan Tolchinsky asserts.- We always ask the Ukrainian military about feedback, we always ask what to do in the drone so that it is even more effective. We have completely translated nasterface in Ukrainian, created special training films.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> “Helping Ukraine is right” </strong></h3>
<p>The conversation comes about information that has appeared on some sites about what Ukraine allegedly blocks Atlas.</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not. The phrase was torn from the context. We really had communication by the Zavurnalists, where we told that the opening of our plant in Ukraine is delayed in time ... Because we do not yet know how to bring memomo -component, we need to understand what the situation will be with taxes, deprivation for production ... when Ukrainians come To Europe and want to open the enterprise, they have many questions on how to do it. So, when we are going to work in Ukraine: do we need ISO, do you need other certification for our products? Because for each market there is its own -specific. That is, it's not easy. You will not build the plant in a month, ”adds the Guineaire.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-12T26-00-00-04-00/6_edit.jpg" />He notes that in the course of creating a Ministry of Defense accelerator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, we know that the Defense Ministry now has an accelerated process of obtaining a downship of new developments. We know that now everything is so simplified that you can get this tolerance in less than 45 days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Reference. </strong> <a href="https://mil-tech.gov.ua/">Ministry of Defense Acseler</a>-a permanent body designed to accelerate the processes within the Ministry of Defense of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The first results:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process of processing applications from the developers of the RAC to their codification and admission of pre -examination - for "mature" decisions is reduced to 45 days;</li>
</ul>
<p>-the process of interaction of the weapons and military equipment in the communication of the change-<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetACF9zk1Q0UY5LMRCZS70NgMdneFMBvGp2CXcpfrNhTKkrQ/viewform">introduced a "single window" for requests from enterprises of the defense-industrial complex, developers-investors-investors of weapons and military equipment.</a>Ivan Tolchinsky says that Ukrainian experts work in his company in the Uris office.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the office in Ukraine, we also recruit people. By the way, experts in this field of Vevropyp. And there are many such young specialists in your country. And we are at us that our office worked in Ukraine after the war, we want to develop the base, developments, - the head of ATLAS shares plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the conversation, he says why his company helps the Armed Forces:<strong> Background: <em>altasPro –</em> </strong> _ light -unmanned tricopter. Its compact design makes it easy and intended for use in almost any weather. His connection is reliable, encrypted and allows to perform Bvlos missions(beyond the direct visibility)At a distance of up to 15 km.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-12T28-00-00-04-00/delta.jpg" />The Ukrainian system of situational awareness of Delta has successfully passed NATO tests to integrate Western equipment, including F-16 fighters.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/zedigital/3367">reported</a>Viceremier-Minister of Zinnovations, Development of Education, Science and Technology-Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.</p>
<p>In June this year, the annual [NATOCWIX training] took place in Poland(https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/11/ukrayina-vkotre-vystupyla-na-shhorichnyh-navchannyah-nato-iz-vzayemosumisnosti-cwix/)from interdependent battle and information systems with NATO systems and protocols.</p>
<p>Delta was successfully protested with 15 systems from 10 countries, including 3 systems developed directly by NATO. All the tests for the mutual bully, and Delta again confirmed its unique opportunities, ” - said Mikhail Fedorov.</p>
<p>He also reported that they have protested 4 data exchange protocols, which will work for the majority of modern weapons that Ukraine receives from Western partners. All these samples of the latest technology can be integrated with Delta to be cleared even more efficiently.</p>
<p>“The main protocol that has been protested this year is Link 16. It is given to receive data in Delta from F-16 fighters that are so needed by Ukraine. This is a powerful step. After all, Delta soldiers see the battle with the location of enemy forces online. This is the only platform in Ukraine, data from aeronautics, satellites, drones, modern equipment, stationary cameras, radars, chatbots and more are depressed. All these data allow you to plan military operations and effectively destroy the invaders, ”Viceremier-Minister said.</p>
<p>He emphasized that having a national military system capable of working as high standards, as important as having combat pilots, which are able to master the new generation fighters.</p>
<p>"These are real achievements that Ukraine should be proud of and can be bold to NATO partners," Mikhail Fedorov summarized.</p>

Our warriors have a maximally fresh experience of cooperation with various members of the Alliance. NATO's weapons have already proven that globaladademocracy is stronger than terrorist threats to anyone against us. Even during a full -scale war, Ukraine continues reforms. And in the framework of our pathintegration into the EU clearly it is clearly determined what we have to do, and we do it, - said Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Vilnius during a joint pressing by the General Secretary of the Alliance Jens Stoltenberg on the results of two -way communication.</p>
<p>The President of Ukraine noted that the summit has been extremely important for all Ukrainians - Ukraine will be officially provided security guarantees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today we had success at the summit. For all of us, for our warriors, people, children, in particular on safety guarantees - such important for all. Security guarantee for Ukraine on the way to NATO, but not instead of NATO. Once again, I do not cite instead, but on the way of our Euro -Atlantic integration, - said the president of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>He noted that he hopes that today these security guarantees can support the Big Seven.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky also thanked the Republic of Lithuania for his incredible reception and support of Ukraine.</p>
<ul>
<li>All we see on the streets - all those flags are not some artificiality, a human attitude. It is a great support and great energy for us. As long as it goes to NATO, but we feel it is a reality that it is our protection. This is the support of the societies of the world, I thank you for it. It seems to me, moreover, because it is a belief in Ukraine as a future equal member, as a guarantor of security, and belief in Ukraine as a winner in this war of jurisdiction and rights of people, - said Vladimir Zelensky.</li>

<p>In this decision, part of the Ministry of Defense's proposals in the interests of defense capabilities was supported, namely, justice was partially restored against Ukrainian suppliers of goods, works and services for defense needs. The sophisticated Ukrainian business will be equal in rights with a foreign business, as a defense department. This will ensure predictability, rhythm of supply and payment under contracts(contracts).</p>
<p>Про це йдеться у<a href="https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2023/07/12/ministerstvo-oboroni-ukraini-prodovzhit-zahishhati-ukrainskih-virobnikiv-v-interesah-sil-oboroni-ukraini/">матеріалі</a>on the official website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In particular, the Cabinet of Ministers has determined that as part of the value(prices)goods, works and services to meet the needs of the security and defense sector(Supply reward)performer.</p>
<p>“Formally protecting the interests of Ukrainian business is not a responsibility of the Ministers Defense. But only formally. Because the stable work of Ukrainian state and private suppliers of weapons, equipment, ammunition, objects of support is the direct interest of the Armed Forces and other components of defense forces. By protecting Ukrainian business, we protect the interests of defense. This is overwhelming sovereignty, our margin of strength. We need more Ukrainian weapons. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense consistently advocates that the Ukrainian business is developing, increasing production capacity. We simplify administrative processes, created a special mechanism - the MOU accelerator to quickly conduct OVT developers with bureaucratic slums. Thanks to this, we already have a durable dynamics for UAV production, we are already fully provided by the Army of Army helmets, bulletproof vests, basic positions of real property. Therefore, I considered and consider the requirements of the State Judicial Service to actually put the interests of foreign producers higher than Ukrainian and deprive the Ukrainian business right to profit. There is no logic in this, it is directly intensified by the interests of defense and the norms of the current legislation, ” - said Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov.The requirements of the State Judicial Service, which are considered by the Ministry of Defense, are unambiguous and appealed in court, with respect to the recovery of the funds specified as a profit from the Ukrainian business that cooperated with the sector and safety from the beginning of the legal regime of martial law.</p>
<p>This creates the conditions for violation of the stable work of Ukrainian producers there is a negative impact on the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, government colleagues, including those whose direct duty is to protect the Ukrainian economy, have not supported the position of the Defense Ministry in part, which is being restored to the restoration of justice since the beginning of martial law. For example, the defendants are current contracts with the leaders of the Ukrainian OPC, which end in 20124-25. We have hundreds of current contracts with Ukrainian producers this year. How to be with them? How to be with those that have already been fulfilled? The possibility of double interpretation of norms and pressure on business. Mindobors with this approach does not agree, so we will continue to challenge the approval of the State Judicial Service to law enforcement in court, ” - said the Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov.</p>
