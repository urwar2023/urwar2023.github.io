<p>Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Alexander Kubrakov spoke about the continuation of the Geruric Agreement.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/oleksandr-kubrakov-zernovu-uhodu-rozblokovano">reports</a>Government portal.</p>
<p>“The grain agreement is unlocked, it will continue its validity until July 18. It will be a lot of receiving Ukrainian products thanks to the efforts of our partners, Turkey and the UN. We are grateful to partners for the adamant and purposeful suggestion that the agreement should work in the future and on the conditions signed by all. I note that the grain initiative was and is valid, as it prolonged March for 120 days, until July 18, ”Alexander Kubrakov emphasized.</p>
<p>To date, 30.4 million tonag products have already been sent to the needs of the world. Since mid -April, Russia has groundlessly launched the work of initiative, and in May, in fact, blocked it by refusing to register a fleet and conducting inspections of the fleet, which is going to load D -Ukrainian ports. Almost 70 vessels are now expected in territorial waters, 90% are those who are ready to deliver our farmers' products to the world.</p>
<p>“We welcome the continuation of the initiative, but we emphasize that it should work effectively. To do this, it is necessary to eliminate problems that are already created by Russia by sabotage of inspections and registration of a new Flot. We hope that our partners will make every effort to make the grain agreement fully work on the food security of the world, and Russia will eventually use food as weapons and blackmail, ”the testimony reads.</p>

Ukraine is not just a reliable partner, it is a strong country that knows how to fight and efficiently destroy them. Ukraine is a real NATO oriental shield, the Cereal Eastern Shield of the European Union. That is why the acquisition of our country in the Alliance is one of the key elements of a strong system of international safe architecture, - said the minister.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alexei Reznikov emphasized on the importance of Ukraine's conquest of the prime, which will allow successfully to carry out land operations, in particular the deposits of Ukrainian territories. That is why, according to him, at least the fourth generation is needed by our defenders to defend from Russian air terrorism and subsequently make them a part of national air defense.</p>
<p>American delegates have expressed words of support to our country and the remarkable integrity and sustainability of Ukrainian servicemen in the struggle of Ukraine. Mary Katherine Hitkamp emphasized that the heroic of a more convenient people is a striking example not only for the US but for the world.</p>

<p>The expert stressed that more than 50% of these funds went to RT, to VGTRK(All -Russian State Television and Radio Language Company)and on the media group "Russia today". At the same time, the study revealed a trend by which the budget has increased from year to year.</p>
<p>Romanyuk also noted that to calculate the full amount of funds that the government <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>It was impossible to propagate propaganda because not all funds are shown in open sources.</p>
<p>"For example, in addition to the Cinema Foundation, other sources can also sponsor propaganda in films. And the same botthams - they are not marked in the budget, the alecosters are highlighted," the expert said.</p>

There were no options. They believed that no one would be able to create a serious opposition, and they would enter the government quarter, change the leadership.

<p>This was reported by Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>The project assumes that naturalization can be allowed in five years, and in the individual cases - three years instead of eight, as still.</p>
<p>“We only allow to naturalize in five years instead of eight. Those who are in particular integrated can reduce this period to three years. Cestos people who are well -versed in German, reach excellent results at work or volunteer. We intend to determine the enormous life achievements of the Gastarbeiter generation for our country. That is why we plan to make it easier for them, ”Nancy Phaseker said.</p>
<p>She gave an example of Canada - as an example of attracting skilled workers, which are also urgently needed by Germany.</p>

A person should be able to pay for himself and his family members.</p>
<p>Fezer noted that many immigrants feel Germans, but do not want to break the country of origin. In the future, they will no longer be forced to give up some of their identity.</p>
<p>The minister emphasized that such manifestations as anti -Semitism, xenophobia or other ideas, motivated by inhumanity, which are incompatible with the guarantee of human dignity of the Vosvna Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and violate the free democratic basic order, will not be tolerated in society. And those who promote will not be able to become a German citizen.</p>

<p>About it in an interview in the program "Year -Sketch. The intelligence officer ”said the head of the intelligence department of MOU Kirill Budanov, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“The whole plan of the Russians was - a rapid landing way(At the airportGostomel - Order.)And to go from there. It was generally a single plan, ”said Budanov.</p>
<p>He added that the whole day on February 24, 2022 the Russians tried to plant a Tamdesant, and the holiday believed that they would succeed.</p>
<p>"First, they did not believe that it would be resisting at all, secondly, they believed that they would be laid rapidly, and the plane would unload the units that would enter Kiev any time," said GUR Chief.</p>
<p>According to him, the last role in this played the information that our intelligence spread.</p>

Why, the Russian people were stupid, they did not believe that there would still be a war: they did not take with them fuel tanks, they stopped tanks, there was no supply of supplies, food, this is all true. But the truth is different-they had to create a picture-mounted offensive and an alternative to surrender. And to create a picture of these columns. So it was. No one hoped to fight like Umariupoli. There were no options. They believed that no one would be able to create a serious opposition, and they would enter the government quarter, change the leadership. In their view, the state management at this time should have escaped somewhere, if not - they would destroy it, ”Budanov said.</p>
<p>He added that Russia changed the invasion date within two weeks. Ukraine received the final information about the attack at 4 am on February 24 at about 15.00023.</p>

<p>This was reported by the founder of the initiative of "Notagonota" Alona Romanyuk to refer to the study of the project <a href="https://www.debunk.org/about"></a> <a href="https://www.debunk.org/about"></a>In a comment to Ukrinform.</p>

At the same time, it should be borne in mind that these funds were directed only to the state. This amount does not include social networks, propaganda through cinema, botthams, costs of propaganda through education, "she said.</p>
<p>The expert stressed that more than 50% of these funds went to RT, to VGTRK(All -Russian State Television and Radio Language Company)and on the media group "Russia today". At the same time, the study revealed a trend by which the budget has increased from year to year.</p>
<p>Romanyuk also noted that to calculate the full amount of funds that the government <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>It was impossible to propagate propaganda because not all funds are shown in open sources.</p>
<p>"For example, in addition to the Cinema Foundation, other sources can also sponsor propaganda in films. And the same botthams - they are not marked in the budget, the alecosters are highlighted," the expert said.</p>

<p>The Security Service conducted a multi -stage special operation during which she detained the willow agent of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation(better known as the game).</p>
<p>Зловмисник збирав для окупантів розвіддані про місця розташування Сил оборонита об’єктів критичної інфраструктури у східних і західних регіонах України.Передусім ворога цікавили локації підрозділів СБУ і Держприкордонслужби, атакож точні координати ключових мостів та електропідстанцій на Харківщині таБуковині.</p>
<p>Затримано російського агента у Чернівцях під час проведення ним прихованоїфотофіксації військового об’єкта. Ним виявився місцевий житель, який у 2021році переїхав до Харкова і працював техніком з налаштування інтернету.</p>
<p>Після початку широкомасштабного вторгнення він почав активно поширюватипрокремлівські наративи на власній сторінці у забороненій соцмережі«Одноклассники» та потрапив у поле зору російської воєнної розвідки. Згодом нанього дистанційно вийшов кадровий співробітник гру, який запропонував негласнуспівпрацю на користь країни-агресора.</p>
<p>Перебуваючи у Харкові, ворожий агент виконував вказівки свого російського«куратора» щодо збору даних про дислокацію блокпостів та фортифікаційнихспоруд у місті. Крім того, він передавав окупантам геолокації місцевихенергооб’єктів.</p>
<p>Невдовзі фігурант отримав нове завдання — повернутись до Чернівців підвиглядом відвідування родичів. Хоча насправді метою «поїздки» було шпигуванняза обласним управлінням СБУ, прикордонним загоном та місцевим військкоматом.Також у центрі уваги зловмисника були транспортні мости регіону — їхкоординати і система охорони.</p>
<p>На підставі зібраних доказів слідчі Служби безпеки повідомили російськомуагенту про підозру у державній зраді, вчиненій в умовах воєнного стану. Наразівін перебуває під вартою. Триває розслідування.</p>

<p>“Ukraine has a significant branched river network, which, in addition to the use of transit, is a natural obstacle to the promotion of troops. Authorizing such a disposition on these reservoirs can successfully perform real-efficient landing operations, ”-said the commander of the United States of Ukraine, Lieutenant General-Lieutenant Sergey Naev.</p>
<p>According to him, the war with Russia forced Ukraine to revise and renovate the resistance of the actions of the occupying troops. In particular, in those areas of Ukraine where there is an extensive network of rivers. And, analyzing the state of affairs, the Armed Forces of Ukraine came to the conclusion that the river flotillas were needed.</p>
<p>“The need to create a military river fleet on the Dnieper in the Berezhinized year indicated unfriendly actions by Belarus, which unofficially maintains the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. In addition, it should be borne in mind that the army of Belarus has 19 vessels of a military-year-old Division in Pinsk and a base in Loev, that is, on the border with us, ”Lieutenant General Sergey Naev reported.</p>

<p>Head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Kirill Budanov gave an interview of the project "Different People".</p>
<p>Gur IU press service <a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/kryms-kyi-mist-ne-potriben-nachal-nyk-hur-mo-ukrainy-kyrylo-budanov.html">cites</a>The main theses of the interview.</p>
<p><strong> "Art of War": </strong></p>
<p>The fact that we disorient the opponent is exactly a fact. Until everything is not tired, they, I think, will not understand what was happening at all.</p>
<p>What is more important: to confuse the enemy or risk that someone in Ukraine will not understand it correctly? As for me, the answer is obvious: to confuse the worker.</p>
<p><strong> Nuclear Risks: </strong></p>
<p>We did not approach the nuclear war, but we did not depart. In general, this threat is inspired by artificially. Of course, everything is possible in theory, but the likelihood is zero, because all this will end with a strategic loss of Russian federation.</p>
<p>The strategic loss is the destruction of the whole strategic goal of the existence of this political system.</p>
<p><strong> Russia's future in the world: </strong></p>
<p>The Russian leadership wanted "grandeur" to all be reckoned with them - "bipolar world", as they say. The bipolar world may be, but without them. They simply can no longer: neither the level of economy nor in the level of military diplomatic force.</p>
<p><strong> The military potential of the Russian Army: </strong></p>
<p>Everything that the Russians could use against us have already been involved.</p>
<p>The potential for serious offensive actions of the army of the Russian Federation is completely exhausted. The containers have a serious potential for defense. Defense they constructed a seven, correct, powerful. But this is no longer the Russian army that could conduct serious offensive operations.</p>
<p>Local actions at the level of Bakhmut-yes, 50-70 meters a day they manage to pass, and sometimes-it is not possible. It's, sorry, a little bit is not a level for how they said, the second army of the world.</p>
<p>The Group of the Russian Federation, which is involved in hostilities against Ukraine - about 370 thousand -war component, about 20 thousand national guards and about 7 thousand, with a zuzstan for now, a set of various militarized formations.</p>
<p><strong> Shogg's envy: </strong></p>
<p>What says [the owner of the so -called Wagner PEC] Prigozhin is mostly true. Yerechi, who are twoly perceived, but somewhere 80% of what he says is pure.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate to recognize, but the so -called PVC under the conditional name "Wagner" shows efficiency - unlike the Russian army. Against this background, their conflicts were even more exacerbated.Shoggy and Gerasimov's team does everything to erase these PVCs. Unfortunately, I have to admit that Vagner is the most effective. No one in Russian federation is compared to the efficiency of fighting.</p>
<p><strong> Spies in International Legion: </strong></p>
<p>The number of foreign volunteers in early March 2022 reached thousands. Only those who came under the criteria of moral and combat readiness were taken to the international legion.</p>
<p>In the international legion there were spies from different countries, but it is a low percent. Most of those who tried to "shoo out" - and such attempts were, the safety safety was filtered at the stage of selection and interviews.</p>
<p><strong> Russian agency in Ukraine: </strong></p>
<p>The agent network of the Russian Federation in Ukraine remains, but its capacity is much in the myth.</p>
<p><strong> Competition of special services of Ukraine: </strong></p>
<p>I personally respect the baby General. I have friendly with him, you can say, even personal relationships. Everything is wonderful with him.</p>
<p>Healthy competition between special services is always a normal process. It is very good that it is.</p>
<p><strong> GUR agents in the Kremlin: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, in Russia we have our sources that inform us perfectly.</p>
<p><strong> Valuation of Russian special services: </strong></p>
<p>The Russian army is not the second in the world. Apparently, not the third, but in the top ten.</p>
<p>We are in a state of war with one of the most powerful military vehicles that were taising and very serious, unlike the army, the most powerful system of special services. It would be wrong to underestimate the enemy.</p>
<p>Because we act more or less effectively, it means that we act correctly.</p>
<p><strong> "guerrilla" movement in Russia: </strong></p>
<p>The forces of resistance in Russia are branched, often not combined into a single system, but also controlled organisms.</p>
<p>In our opinion, you do not need to combine them. The traitor in one organization will destroy only one organization. If they are combined, the losses will be not right.</p>
<p><strong> Ukraine is not Russia: </strong></p>
<p>The protest potential of Russian society is almost zero. It will only be possible to shake Russia in the middle when the elites are ready for it. There is no civic society - it is not Ukraine, even incorrectly comparing.</p>
<p><strong> A ferry crossing Taman: </strong></p>
<p>Most of the radical pro-Russian population with the first departments of the Safety and Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Crimea in any format will immediately move through the ferry to the mainland of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>I think the Crimean bridge is not needed.</p>
<p><strong> Belarusian factor: </strong>We used to use all our possible communication paths that we had. Even one people's deputy was, it is also true to prevent Belarus as a country into this war.</p>
<p>Putin lost his hope of drawing Lukashenko into the war. Ammunition from Belarus was Russian, this is true - they took out almost everything that could be. They use polygon -Belarusian to prepare their mobilized ones. After all, that's all.</p>
<p><strong> Drones in the war: </strong></p>
<p>The war proved the concept of maximum efficiency of use of drones and as intelligence, and as Kamikadze.</p>
<p>Drones of reusable use(with a discharge of ammunition)showed less efficiency due to high saturation by means of air defense, both in us and the guide.</p>
<p>Dron Kamikadze, which flies one way, is more likely to success.</p>
<p>Drones that should work as planes for the task of blows - they are usually beaten.</p>
<p><strong> Participation in Crimean Ride 2016: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I took. So what?</p>
<p>Does it pull "in the field" now? Pulls. Is there anything? At best, rarely. I am and I am with them, but it is clear that it is not 90% of my life.</p>
<p><strong> A decisive moment in the war: </strong></p>
<p>The first day of a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation and battles in Moshchun - these are events that were destroyed by the end of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>The knocking of them from Irpen put a point, but the main thing is the bridge and fighting in Gostomel. These are the events that completely destroyed the Russian plan.</p>
<p>We need to make efforts to finish everything in 2023.</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to intensify, because the enemy does not depart from our plans. The aircraft-16 will certainly help Ukraine drive away Russian aviation. If this is alternated, say, in the Sumy, Chernihiv or Kharkiv region, then Russian pilots are unlikely to dare to fly closer and to throw Ababombs, - said Yuri Ignat. - Therefore, the issue of aircraft and their dispersal and all the territory of Ukraine will solve this problem, and most importantly, that it will solve the problem of rockets and drones that are constantly attacking Ukraine. After all, this aircraft is part of the state's air defense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, he believes that Ukrainian combat pilots will be able to quickly master the use of the F-16 aircraft.</p>
<p>-For our pilots to learn how to fly on the F-16 is not a problem, this needs to be needed, but here to fight and use all the weapons that this aircraft has, a pretty thing. I am sure that our pilots will easily cope with it, - said Ignat.</p>

This is an open manipulation. The negotiations on the release of the Chernobyl defenders, as well as all other boys and girls, do not stop. We are ready to pick up everyone when this aggressor country agrees. "</p>
<p>There were several National Guards who were released at the meeting.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to thank the hospitality of his royal high -grade Prince Muhammad, all the people of Saudi Arabia and Misudzhidda, who accepts this summit.</p>
<p>I hope we are all here for peace and justice.</p>
<p><strong> _ Dear participants of the summit!_ </strong></p>
<p>Today is the 450th day of a full-scale war, which is conducted against Nazi invaders.</p>
<p>We do not have such rockets that our enemy has. We have much less aviation. We do not have numerous killing drones that Iran supplies Russia. We do not have so much artillery. But we remain strong, because on our side is true. Moreover, we displace the invaders from our land.</p>
<p>Anyone who protects their native land from the invaders, anyone who protects the children of their mother -in -law from enslavement, every such warrior - on the path of justice. I am proud of such warriors and all Ukrainian people!</p>
<p>The war has never been a choice of Ukrainians. Our troops did not go to foreign lands, we are not engaged in annexation and robbery of other peoples' resources. But we never obey any strangers and colonizers. So we fight!And Yavpeat is that all your peoples will understand this main emotion.</p>
<p>I am also sure that all your peoples will understand the main call that I want to stir here in Jedd. A noble call for all of you is to promote the protection of our people, including the Ukrainian Muslim community!</p>
<p>Together with me here - highly respected Mustafa Dzhemilev, leader of the Crimean Tatar Narode, one of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. Their house is Crimea, a focalian culture in Ukraine. For centuries, the Crimean Tatar people have been named to remain an integral and strong component of the Muslim community. But Crimea was the first to suffer from the Russian occupation, and most of those who undergo repression in the occupied Crimea are themuslims themselves.</p>
<p>We already have a positive experience with Saudi Arabia - about the liberation of our peoples captured by Russia. We can expand this experience!</p>
<p>And even if there are people who have a different view of war on our earth, calling it a conflict, I am sure that we can all be united in order to save our people from the cages of Russian prisons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are those who close their eyes on the cages of tangent annexation in the world and here. I am here for everyone to look honestly. Whatever the ashamed of the Russians, but independence should still be. And I want to dress Saudi Arabia, I want to thank the absolute majority of you to retain sustainable international positions and the UN Charter.Your people could already make sure that Ukrainians are the people of peace. True Mir. In 2021, we determined the openness of Ukraine for your people. And the peoples of Saudi Arabia, united Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait met Ukraine. I am happy that your tourists have been able to see the luxury of spring in our capital, in Kiev, and the grandeur of the Carpathians!</p>
<p>I believe that one day your people will return, in particular, to see the Crimea free from Russian occupation and humiliation.</p>
<p>Our relationships are also built on our universities tens of thousands ofurabs every year. It is an honor for us that the children of Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia went to Ukraine for education.</p>
<p>We, together with you, did one of the most honorable missions in the world - guaranteed food safety. Ukraine traditionally provides wheat with other agricultural products. We were glad to welcome and investment peoples - as well as Qatar's investment in port infrastructure.</p>
<p>Initially, the pandemic, and then the more terrible virus - the rabies of aggression - hit these other normal relationships on these other normal relationships.</p>
<p>I am more than sure that none of you will agree to give the invaders a thirdin country. I am more than sure that none of you would look at you without a fight, Yakhuzhinka steals the children of your people. Hundreds of thousands of our children have deported the benefits, divorced from relatives, and our children there, in Russia, are taught to hate their compatriots. I am more than sure that none of you would have resigned out the nuclear power plant occupation to use it to blackmail the world with a nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>See how many years of suffering have brought Libya, Syria, Yemen ... How many lives have been warmed for years of hostilities in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq Taafganistan ...</p>
<p>Anyone who adds suffering with their new aggression, anyone who sows enmity, anyone who wants the old days of the invading empires that did not pay attention to the volunte -dependent nations - every such offender goes against the world and will be cursed.</p>
<p>And I congratulate everyone who together with us is ready to embark on the path of justice!Each of the honorary delegations was handed the document in your language with ten -major peace formulas. Please you can choose the direction you know appropriate. And I will be grateful to each of you who will choose the direction of rescuing people who are kept in Russian captivity. Therefore, I invite all who respect peace, to join the realization of the formula of peace and thus reduce the war and wars, suffering and evil.</p>
<p>Russia is weak, we win it even when it is in the hands of more resistance; Its aggressiveness is not from power, but from the realization that time was empire. This is because the time of free peoples will never pass, and Ukraine proves it.</p>
<p>Wishing you peace!I invite you to direct cooperation, without any intermediaries, with the country. And let our strength act coordinated for the rest of the tabula of people of all peoples!</p>
<p>And please hear the Crimean Tatar people, hear Muslims of Ukraine!</p>
<p>May the Most High keep our warriors!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

<li>the function of organizing and conducting purchases for the needs of the Armed Forces, publishing information on procurement and consideration of proposals of suppliers for the provisions is entrusted to the collegial body - the commission of the Ministry of Defense on Defense Procurement in the direction of rear support. It is an independent body that is not affected by the Ministry of Defense officials. The commission will determine the technical ironing requirements and submit an announcement for publication in the systemiprozorro. I will note that the commission also includes representatives of the Public Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense. Unlike the previous ones, the current procedure provides open and transparent bidding with the use of Prozorro's mass system, - said Denis Sharapov.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-19T96-00-00-04-00/8001cfa2-ef7b-4ad3-9e00-06718110a2d9.jpg" />Maxim Gritsenko noted that at the beginning of a large -scale invasion of food suppliers were critically limited to feed the army that increased significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we allow all those who wish to apply for bidding, offer an adequate price and adhere to all the criteria. Among the innovations is the introduction of marginal prices, which aims to prevent deliberate prices by the supplier to certain categories of products, - Maximgritsenko added.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the subject of purchasing food kits will be divided into 22 lots, with the compulsory compliance with the principle of "food goes for the military". That is, products must be supplied where the military unit is from the list of the relevant contract.</p>
<p>According to Maxim Gritsenko, it is quite optimistic that multi -companies participated in a working meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope that in the near future they will provide their offers and thanks to the competition we will receive quality food at a weighted price, - said Maxim Gritsenko.</li>
</ul>
<p>The active participants in the working meeting were members of the Public Anti -Corruption Council at the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the working meeting, the representative of the Public Anti -Corruption Council, Olegsirko, noted the constructive position of the defense department on the Organization of Nutrition of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-19T96-00-00-04-00/db539dfa-6a78-48d3-b2e5-4f5143eb4032.jpg" />- Speaking of a food system, it is advanced. This is, in fact, the system of NATO's armies, which in 2015 was somewhat hurriedly implemented. It is because of the rush that the problems that now lead to scandals have arisen. The army needs to be fed today, and in order to improve the existing mechanisms about their transparency, time and calculations are needed. What I see azaraz is undoubtedly a way forward. Today we have seen the intermediate system of food organizations of the Armed Forces, which still needs improvement. But the design position of the Ministry of Defense in this matter is most important, - said OlegSirko.</p>
