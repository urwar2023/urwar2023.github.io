Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure Alexander Kubrakov spoke about the continuation of the Geruric Agreement.
About it reports Government portal.
“The grain agreement is unlocked, it will continue its validity until July 18. It will be a lot of receiving Ukrainian products thanks to the efforts of our partners, Turkey and the UN. We are grateful to partners for the adamant and purposeful suggestion that the agreement should work in the future and on the conditions signed by all. I note that the grain initiative was and is valid, as it prolonged March for 120 days, until July 18, ”Alexander Kubrakov emphasized.
To date, 30.4 million tonag products have already been sent to the needs of the world. Since mid -April, Russia has groundlessly launched the work of initiative, and in May, in fact, blocked it by refusing to register a fleet and conducting inspections of the fleet, which is going to load D -Ukrainian ports. Almost 70 vessels are now expected in territorial waters, 90% are those who are ready to deliver our farmers' products to the world.
“We welcome the continuation of the initiative, but we emphasize that it should work effectively. To do this, it is necessary to eliminate problems that are already created by Russia by sabotage of inspections and registration of a new Flot. We hope that our partners will make every effort to make the grain agreement fully work on the food security of the world, and Russia will eventually use food as weapons and blackmail, ”the testimony reads.

There were no options. They believed that no one would be able to create a serious opposition, and they would enter the government quarter, change the leadership.

The Security Service conducted a multi -stage special operation during which she detained the willow agent of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation(better known as the game).
Зловмисник збирав для окупантів розвіддані про місця розташування Сил оборонита об’єктів критичної інфраструктури у східних і західних регіонах України.Передусім ворога цікавили локації підрозділів СБУ і Держприкордонслужби, атакож точні координати ключових мостів та електропідстанцій на Харківщині таБуковині.
Затримано російського агента у Чернівцях під час проведення ним прихованоїфотофіксації військового об’єкта. Ним виявився місцевий житель, який у 2021році переїхав до Харкова і працював техніком з налаштування інтернету.
Після початку широкомасштабного вторгнення він почав активно поширюватипрокремлівські наративи на власній сторінці у забороненій соцмережі«Одноклассники» та потрапив у поле зору російської воєнної розвідки. Згодом нанього дистанційно вийшов кадровий співробітник гру, який запропонував негласнуспівпрацю на користь країни-агресора.
Перебуваючи у Харкові, ворожий агент виконував вказівки свого російського«куратора» щодо збору даних про дислокацію блокпостів та фортифікаційнихспоруд у місті. Крім того, він передавав окупантам геолокації місцевихенергооб’єктів.
Невдовзі фігурант отримав нове завдання — повернутись до Чернівців підвиглядом відвідування родичів. Хоча насправді метою «поїздки» було шпигуванняза обласним управлінням СБУ, прикордонним загоном та місцевим військкоматом.Також у центрі уваги зловмисника були транспортні мости регіону — їхкоординати і система охорони.
На підставі зібраних доказів слідчі Служби безпеки повідомили російськомуагенту про підозру у державній зраді, вчиненій в умовах воєнного стану. Наразівін перебуває під вартою. Триває розслідування.

And, analyzing the state of affairs, the Armed Forces of Ukraine came to the conclusion that the river flotillas were needed.
“The need to create a military river fleet on the Dnieper in the Berezhinized year indicated unfriendly actions by Belarus, which unofficially maintains the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. In addition, it should be borne in mind that the army of Belarus has 19 vessels of a military-year-old Division in Pinsk and a base in Loev, that is, on the border with us, ”Lieutenant General Sergey Naev reported.

 The inhabitants of the Russian Federation are preparing for the existence in the war conditions for the two years, affirming in the public consciousness of the belief that the war is the cenorm of the Russian life. This observation was made by Doctor of Historical Sciences(Institute of History of Ukraine of NASU)Larisa Yakubova during the operation of the round table "Rashism. Understand to overcome. ”
Signals that Russians have to be patience for a quarter of a century have been broadcast by the Kremlin since November 2022. Citizens of the Russian Federation are prepared for the fact that hundreds of thousands will be sent to the Ukrainian Front, and the war of anti -Ukraine is now a new Russian national idea for at least the next anniversary. In this state, gradually degraded and decomposed, Russia can be able to exist for a long time, because the ideology of Rashism, the Russians will be able to change their consciousness.
This is, according to Larisa Yakubova, an oncologically ill totalitarian, which destroyed and replaced society and the state, able to exist for many years. Russian citizens will consider it normal, unnoticed that they live under the reign of a totalitarian regime, and not realizing that the ideology of Rashism has been broadcast by him in common with fascism dissent.
 The main features of such a system in political practice are endless populism of zesting, and the main task is to destroy any signs of subjectivity, except for the officially allowed totalitarianism of the state political and Russian national identities. Citizens of the Russian Federation were not noticed how they were delayed in totalitarianism, due to the fact that the creations of ideology and dominant regime avoided its definition and name.According to the scientist, from the proclamation of the official ideology, which in Ukraine, the term "Rashism" has already been marked, the Kremlin regime is currently keeping the only way to avoid the use of historically compromised terms such as "Nazism" or "fascism". This was warned by the beloved philosopher Vladimirapoutin Ivan Ilyin, who is considered one of the main theorists of Russian fascism.
 Thus, the threat to the Russian totalitarian regime in Ukraine and the world can be no dangerous and long -term. This should be taken into account when developing planning and counteracting the aggression of the Russian Federation.

The fact that we disorient the opponent is exactly a fact. Until everything is not tired, they, I think, will not understand what was happening at all.
What is more important: to confuse the enemy or risk that someone in Ukraine will not understand it correctly? As for me, the answer is obvious: to confuse the worker.
Nuclear Risks: 
We did not approach the nuclear war, but we did not depart. In general, this threat is inspired by artificially. Of course, everything is possible in theory, but the likelihood is zero, because all this will end with a strategic loss of Russian federation.
The strategic loss is the destruction of the whole strategic goal of the existence of this political system.
Russia's future in the world: 
The Russian leadership wanted "grandeur" to all be reckoned with them - "bipolar world", as they say. The bipolar world may be, but without them. They simply can no longer: neither the level of economy nor in the level of military diplomatic force.
The military potential of the Russian Army: 
Everything that the Russians could use against us have already been involved.
The potential for serious offensive actions of the army of the Russian Federation is completely exhausted. The containers have a serious potential for defense. Defense they constructed a seven, correct, powerful. But this is no longer the Russian army that could conduct serious offensive operations.
Local actions at the level of Bakhmut-yes, 50-70 meters a day they manage to pass, and sometimes-it is not possible. It's, sorry, a little bit is not a level for how they said, the second army of the world.
The Group of the Russian Federation, which is involved in hostilities against Ukraine - about 370 thousand -war component, about 20 thousand national guards and about 7 thousand, with a zuzstan for now, a set of various militarized formations.
Shogg's envy: 
What says [the owner of the so -called Wagner PEC] Prigozhin is mostly true. Yerechi, who are twoly perceived, but somewhere 80% of what he says is pure.
It is unfortunate to recognize, but the so -called PVC under the conditional name "Wagner" shows efficiency - unlike the Russian army. Against this background, their conflicts were even more exacerbated.Shoggy and Gerasimov's team does everything to erase these PVCs. Unfortunately, I have to admit that Vagner is the most effective. No one in Russian federation is compared to the efficiency of fighting.
Spies in International Legion: 
The number of foreign volunteers in early March 2022 reached thousands. Only those who came under the criteria of moral and combat readiness were taken to the international legion.
In the international legion there were spies from different countries, but it is a low percent. Most of those who tried to "shoo out" - and such attempts were, the safety safety was filtered at the stage of selection and interviews.
Russian agency in Ukraine: 
The agent network of the Russian Federation in Ukraine remains, but its capacity is much in the myth.
Competition of special services of Ukraine: 
I personally respect the baby General. I have friendly with him, you can say, even personal relationships. Everything is wonderful with him.
Healthy competition between special services is always a normal process. It is very good that it is.
GUR agents in the Kremlin: 
Yes, in Russia we have our sources that inform us perfectly.
Valuation of Russian special services: 
The Russian army is not the second in the world. Apparently, not the third, but in the top ten.
We are in a state of war with one of the most powerful military vehicles that were taising and very serious, unlike the army, the most powerful system of special services. It would be wrong to underestimate the enemy.
Because we act more or less effectively, it means that we act correctly.
"guerrilla" movement in Russia: 
The forces of resistance in Russia are branched, often not combined into a single system, but also controlled organisms.
In our opinion, you do not need to combine them. The traitor in one organization will destroy only one organization. If they are combined, the losses will be not right.
Ukraine is not Russia: 
The protest potential of Russian society is almost zero. It will only be possible to shake Russia in the middle when the elites are ready for it. There is no civic society - it is not Ukraine, even incorrectly comparing.
A ferry crossing Taman: 
Most of the radical pro-Russian population with the first departments of the Safety and Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Crimea in any format will immediately move through the ferry to the mainland of the Russian Federation.
I think the Crimean bridge is not needed.
Belarusian factor: We used to use all our possible communication paths that we had. Even one people's deputy was, it is also true to prevent Belarus as a country into this war.
Putin lost his hope of drawing Lukashenko into the war. Ammunition from Belarus was Russian, this is true - they took out almost everything that could be. They use polygon -Belarusian to prepare their mobilized ones. After all, that's all.
Drones in the war: 
The war proved the concept of maximum efficiency of use of drones and as intelligence, and as Kamikadze.
Drones of reusable use(with a discharge of ammunition)showed less efficiency due to high saturation by means of air defense, both in us and the guide.
Dron Kamikadze, which flies one way, is more likely to success.
Drones that should work as planes for the task of blows - they are usually beaten.
Participation in Crimean Ride 2016: 
Yes, I took. So what?
Does it pull "in the field" now? Pulls. Is there anything? At best, rarely. I am and I am with them, but it is clear that it is not 90% of my life.
A decisive moment in the war: 
The first day of a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation and battles in Moshchun - these are events that were destroyed by the end of the Russian Federation.
The knocking of them from Irpen put a point, but the main thing is the bridge and fighting in Gostomel. These are the events that completely destroyed the Russian plan.
We need to make efforts to finish everything in 2023.

First of all, I would like to thank the hospitality of his royal high -grade Prince Muhammad, all the people of Saudi Arabia and Misudzhidda, who accepts this summit.
I hope we are all here for peace and justice.
_ Dear participants of the summit!_ 
Today is the 450th day of a full-scale war, which is conducted against Nazi invaders.
We do not have such rockets that our enemy has. We have much less aviation. We do not have numerous killing drones that Iran supplies Russia. We do not have so much artillery. But we remain strong, because on our side is true. Moreover, we displace the invaders from our land.
Anyone who protects their native land from the invaders, anyone who protects the children of their mother -in -law from enslavement, every such warrior - on the path of justice. I am proud of such warriors and all Ukrainian people!
The war has never been a choice of Ukrainians. Our troops did not go to foreign lands, we are not engaged in annexation and robbery of other peoples' resources. But we never obey any strangers and colonizers. So we fight!And Yavpeat is that all your peoples will understand this main emotion.
I am also sure that all your peoples will understand the main call that I want to stir here in Jedd. A noble call for all of you is to promote the protection of our people, including the Ukrainian Muslim community!
Together with me here - highly respected Mustafa Dzhemilev, leader of the Crimean Tatar Narode, one of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. Their house is Crimea, a focalian culture in Ukraine. For centuries, the Crimean Tatar people have been named to remain an integral and strong component of the Muslim community. But Crimea was the first to suffer from the Russian occupation, and most of those who undergo repression in the occupied Crimea are themuslims themselves.
We already have a positive experience with Saudi Arabia - about the liberation of our peoples captured by Russia. We can expand this experience!
And even if there are people who have a different view of war on our earth, calling it a conflict, I am sure that we can all be united in order to save our people from the cages of Russian prisons.
Unfortunately, there are those who close their eyes on the cages of tangent annexation in the world and here. I am here for everyone to look honestly. Whatever the ashamed of the Russians, but independence should still be. And I want to dress Saudi Arabia, I want to thank the absolute majority of you to retain sustainable international positions and the UN Charter.Your people could already make sure that Ukrainians are the people of peace. True Mir. In 2021, we determined the openness of Ukraine for your people. And the peoples of Saudi Arabia, united Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait met Ukraine. I am happy that your tourists have been able to see the luxury of spring in our capital, in Kiev, and the grandeur of the Carpathians!
I believe that one day your people will return, in particular, to see the Crimea free from Russian occupation and humiliation.
Our relationships are also built on our universities tens of thousands ofurabs every year. It is an honor for us that the children of Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia went to Ukraine for education.
We, together with you, did one of the most honorable missions in the world - guaranteed food safety. Ukraine traditionally provides wheat with other agricultural products. We were glad to welcome and investment peoples - as well as Qatar's investment in port infrastructure.
Initially, the pandemic, and then the more terrible virus - the rabies of aggression - hit these other normal relationships on these other normal relationships.
I am more than sure that none of you will agree to give the invaders a thirdin country. I am more than sure that none of you would look at you without a fight, Yakhuzhinka steals the children of your people. Hundreds of thousands of our children have deported the benefits, divorced from relatives, and our children there, in Russia, are taught to hate their compatriots. I am more than sure that none of you would have resigned out the nuclear power plant occupation to use it to blackmail the world with a nuclear disaster.
See how many years of suffering have brought Libya, Syria, Yemen ... How many lives have been warmed for years of hostilities in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq Taafganistan ...
Anyone who adds suffering with their new aggression, anyone who sows enmity, anyone who wants the old days of the invading empires that did not pay attention to the volunte -dependent nations - every such offender goes against the world and will be cursed.
And I congratulate everyone who together with us is ready to embark on the path of justice!Each of the honorary delegations was handed the document in your language with ten -major peace formulas. Please you can choose the direction you know appropriate. And I will be grateful to each of you who will choose the direction of rescuing people who are kept in Russian captivity. Therefore, I invite all who respect peace, to join the realization of the formula of peace and thus reduce the war and wars, suffering and evil.
Russia is weak, we win it even when it is in the hands of more resistance; Its aggressiveness is not from power, but from the realization that time was empire. This is because the time of free peoples will never pass, and Ukraine proves it.
Wishing you peace!I invite you to direct cooperation, without any intermediaries, with the country. And let our strength act coordinated for the rest of the tabula of people of all peoples!
And please hear the Crimean Tatar people, hear Muslims of Ukraine!
May the Most High keep our warriors!
Glory to Ukraine!
