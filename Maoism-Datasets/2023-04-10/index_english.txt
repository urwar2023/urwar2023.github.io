 The Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada on Humanitarian and Information Policy, Nikitaporoev considers it necessary to accelerate the process of adopting a government-law-proof of religious organizations in Ukraine with a center of management in the aggressor state.
He said this during a briefing at the Media Center "Ukraine - Ukrinform".
“We do not fight . We will not fight the believers. This is not the subject of any in -law that are now registered in the Verkhovna Rada(It is prosecurity aimed at banning the activity of religious organizations with the center of management in the Russian Federation - ed.)”, - Podkayev emphasized.
He noted that Ukraine with these laws records that religious organizations that are in the territory of the aggressor state, which are "actually grown with the ruling so-called Russian Federation", no relations with Ukrainian religious organizations cannot be able to do.
“I believe that it is optimal to accelerate the process of adopting a bill that was developed by the Cabinet of Ministers(No. 8371 "On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine on the Activity of Religious Organizations"). Чому? Томущо там йдеться про всі релігійні організації, а не якусь конкретну”, –підкреслив народний депутат.
На його переконання, ухвалення відповідного документу – це спільне бажанняукраїнського народу встановити таку умову в законодавстві, щоб українськірелігійні організації не мали жодних зв'язків з тими, хто підтримує війну тагеноцид в Україні, прикриваючись світовими релігіями.

 About it told Secretaries of National Security and Defense Alexey Danilov during the discussion "Ukraine before the face of external challenges".
He is convinced that Russia's fragmentation has already begun, and the decision of a full -scale invasion of February 24, 2022 only accelerated this process.
“This fragmentation occurs regardless of the desire of some countries, including Western countries. Everything will start with the Caucasus. And it will continue or not, it depends on us, ”the NSDC secretary emphasized.
If the fragmentation process does not complete, the issue of stability of Ukraine will constantly interrupt on the agenda.
“The country that is in the risk zone does not attract investors. It is not necessary to vitrate that money will be used, regardless of the safety situation. There is a great deal of countries in the world where you can invest without risk. Therefore, if we are not abandoned by Russia's issues, then all other issues will be extremely difficult for us, ”Alexei Danilov said.
In his opinion, new unions and tasks of Ukraine will be formed in the world and the region to make them protect themselves from Russia with their help.
The NSDC Secretary also shared a forecast for the development of the world. The National Security Council has developed five basic scenarios, among them:
1 . revival of democracies and a one -pole world accompanied by the United States
2 . a variable world under the influence of China
3 . a two -pole world in which the US and China will rule
4 . Multipolar world, or the world fragmented into several economic and safety blocks
5 . EU and China coalition that will have the greatest impact
Alexei Danilov is convinced that the most likely is the scenario of the transition of the additive world, or the competitive coexistence of the two countries.

Despite the fact that the army of the Russian Federation is fighting along the entire front line, its advancement is approaching the climax, so the occupiers use artillery to compensate for reduced offensive potential.
About it in your report reports the Institute of War Study(Isw).
Зазначається, що 8 квітня голова Ради резервістів Сухопутних військ УкраїниІван Тимочко повідомив, що російські війська ведуть бої на всій лінії фронту,але наступальний потенціал росії продовжує знижуватися і що нинішні російськіатаки спрямовані на відволікання і розпорошення українських військ вочікуванні контрнаступальних операцій.
Також повідомляється, що Іван Тимочко оцінив атаки рф, зокрема в районіБахмута та Авдіївки. Зазначається, що за його словами російські війська недосягають серйозних успіхів на жодній ділянці фронту, зазначивши, що темпиобстрілів у Бахмуті та навколо нього дещо знизилися на одних ділянках, а наінших — повністю зупинилися.
А російський наступ на Авдіївку, за оцінкою Тимочка — «захлинувся». Вінпідкреслив, що рф досі не взяла під контроль Мар’їнку, незважаючи на те, щоперетворила місто на руїни.
Водночас російські війська використовують артилерію, щоб компенсувати зниженийнаступальний потенціал, повідомляють в ISW.
Аналітики вважають, що високий попит на снаряди свідчить, що росія значноюмірою покладається на артилерію, щоб компенсувати ключові недоліки в бойовійспроможності, зокрема погані навички наземного штурму та недоступність авіаціїв Україні.
російські війська використовують важкі артилерійські обстріли, щоб повністюзруйнувати населені пункти, перш ніж захопити їх наземними атаками.
«Триваючий дефіцит артилерійських боєприпасів у росії підірве здатністьросійських військових продовжувати компенсувати інші свої недоліки таобмеження», — йдеться у зведенні.

 Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Army of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, emphasized this on the broadcasting of the only news.
The Soviet equipment we have in service has virtually no chance to be able to go. Therefore, the aviation platform is important to us: the ships must be 4+, must have the full range of weapons that NATO countries have - winged, controlled, unmanaged and anti -ship missiles, as well as airplanes.
These are the main characteristics that Western fighters should be in line with. The F-16 Lifetime is the most common aircraft in the world today, it has 25 countries in the most likely candidate for Ukraine. However, I will emphasize - the necessary planes are still now, because up to 20 managed aircraft aircraft every day the enemy is used in the frontline zone of Ukraine. This is a great threat that we have to protrude.

-An active information war is underway now, and we must be ready for the fact that any custom and psychological operations can now be. It is necessary to be critical, to check it and to look for an official source,-said Anna Malyar. - That is, the only reliable information to the course of hostilities and perhaps plans for the Armed Forces of Ukraine can only be official sources. The Supreme Commander -in -Chief of Ukraine - the President of Ukraine, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the Head of the Armed Forces of Ukraine can speak about the war. We then declare the General Staff of Taminoborons as an institution. That is, those who are empowered to speak about war and be the primary source of information. In addition, in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, officially authorized persons are presophisters who are often Utelees.
The Ministry of Defense's plans are kept secret, so any discussion is a particular assumption, and they should be perceived as an assumption.
