The diplomat expressed this opinion in [](http://www.facebook.com/pavloklimkin.ua/posts/pfbid0beAGmkiMQNibyZFmsPss3W4kyPagLvPnfbECywwEqNo9f8gua9wQQW9p3jpKUjidl), reports Ukrinform.

Klimkin noted that Macron's hopes of being able to influence China's prevention and personally on SI because of personal charisma and contacts seemed to be futile because "[](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj)\ is a system. "

“But it seems that the macron's position has been influenced: he spoke in mind the" balanced "position in relation to Taiwan, which should be different from both the Varkan and Chinese. Further, Macron began to talk again about "European strategic autonomy", which, of course, balm for Chinese ears, because in Beijing they do not want to have a collective event, the United States at all in Beijing, and so much more than enough, " - said the Excelner.

In this context, Klimkin recalled that Macron once told NATO's "death".

“Our war with the Russian Federation has clearly showed that without the US and NATO in no way, so" death ", as for me, is" European autonomy. " The patient, of course, can be treated, but not at the expense of transatlantic solidarity. The War of the War showed that he could do quantum jumps, but only when Viewed in his strategy and will. Macron's visit to China clearly did not stake this solidarity, he became a demonstration of the French feature, ”the diplomat said.

Finally, he noted that he was touched by Macron's words that Ukraine is probably not a priority for Chinese diplomacy.

"As for me, one of the goals of his visit should be a priority, of course, in a broad sense," Klimkin summarized.

At this time, Ukraine has the opportunity to prepare for a counter -offensive.

According to Ukrinform, the Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov told Wintervia Lithuanian National news agency, reports [](https://www.delfi.lt/ru/news/politics/ministr-oborony-ukrainy-rossijskoe-nastuplenie-terpit-neudachu-my-nanosim-im-kolossalnyj-uron.d?id=93033621).

“Tactics of Creeping” offensive Russians there(Under Bakhmut, ed.)They use for more than half a year and suffer huge losses. This means that if they were not losses, they could use all their potential against us at another defense or other place of the front. In some less fortified and protected place. And now we cause huge losses to them every day, we keep them in the grip ... The Kremlin's dreams and plans to reach the borders of the Donetsk Talugan regions as soon as possible, ”Reznikov said, substantiating that Bakhmut's defense continues.

Reznikov believes that now time is "crucial for Ukraine in the course of preparation for a counter -offensive." In addition, this time works in favor of Ukraine even that "as we can see, more accelerates centrifugal processes of the Russian regime." According to him, "there is a conflict between different towers."

At the same time, as Reznikov said, according to [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rozvidka), the leadership of the Russian regime is ready to mobilize and bring a seizure even 3 million people. In this case, the Kremlin logic is as follows: first, the ancient Ukrainian authorities: grandmothers are still born. "Secondly, according to our intelligence, many higher Kremlin representatives reinforce their strategic calculations and planning the following logic:" We will not regret any one, nyro-millions, because at the expense of those losses we will attach half of Ukraine to Ukraine and thus compensate for these losses. " ”, - added the minister.In addition, Reznikov said that this war would not be able to "freeze" any intervals ".

He said this during a briefing at the Media Center "Ukraine - Ukrinform".

“We do not fight [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-religia). We will not fight the believers. This is not the subject of any in -law that are now registered in the Verkhovna Rada(It is prosecurity aimed at banning the activity of religious organizations with the center of management in the Russian Federation - ed.)”, - Podkayev emphasized.

He noted that Ukraine with these laws records that religious organizations that are in the territory of the aggressor state, which are "actually grown with the ruling so-called Russian Federation", no relations with Ukrainian religious organizations cannot be able to do.

“I believe that it is optimal to accelerate the process of adopting a bill that was developed by the Cabinet of Ministers(No. 8371 "On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine on the Activity of Religious Organizations").

He is convinced that Russia's fragmentation has already begun, and the decision of a full -scale invasion of February 24, 2022 only accelerated this process.

“This fragmentation occurs regardless of the desire of some countries, including Western countries. Everything will start with the Caucasus. And it will continue or not, it depends on us, ”the NSDC secretary emphasized.

If the fragmentation process does not complete, the issue of stability of Ukraine will constantly interrupt on the agenda.

“The country that is in the risk zone does not attract investors. It is not necessary to vitrate that money will be used, regardless of the safety situation. There is a great deal of countries in the world where you can invest without risk. Therefore, if we are not abandoned by Russia's issues, then all other issues will be extremely difficult for us, ”Alexei Danilov said.

In his opinion, new unions and tasks of Ukraine will be formed in the world and the region to make them protect themselves from Russia with their help.

The NSDC Secretary also shared a forecast for the development of the world. The National Security Council has developed five basic scenarios, among them:

1 \. revival of democracies and a one -pole world accompanied by the United States

2 \. a variable world under the influence of China

3 \. a two -pole world in which the US and China will rule

4 \. Multipolar world, or the world fragmented into several economic and safety blocks

5 \. EU and China coalition that will have the greatest impact

Alexei Danilov is convinced that the most likely is the scenario of the transition of the additive world, or the competitive coexistence of the two countries.

Despite the fact that the army of the Russian Federation is fighting along the entire front line, its advancement is approaching the climax, so the occupiers use artillery to compensate for reduced offensive potential.

About it in your [report](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-8-2023)reports the Institute of War Study(Isw).

Зазначається, що 8 квітня голова Ради резервістів Сухопутних військ УкраїниІван Тимочко повідомив, що російські війська ведуть бої на всій лінії фронту,але наступальний потенціал росії продовжує знижуватися і що нинішні російськіатаки спрямовані на відволікання і розпорошення українських військ вочікуванні контрнаступальних операцій.

Також повідомляється, що Іван Тимочко оцінив атаки рф, зокрема в районіБахмута та Авдіївки. Зазначається, що за його словами російські війська недосягають серйозних успіхів на жодній ділянці фронту, зазначивши, що темпиобстрілів у Бахмуті та навколо нього дещо знизилися на одних ділянках, а наінших — повністю зупинилися.

А російський наступ на Авдіївку, за оцінкою Тимочка — «захлинувся». Вінпідкреслив, що рф досі не взяла під контроль Мар’їнку, незважаючи на те, щоперетворила місто на руїни.

Водночас російські війська використовують артилерію, щоб компенсувати зниженийнаступальний потенціал, повідомляють в ISW.

Аналітики вважають, що високий попит на снаряди свідчить, що росія значноюмірою покладається на артилерію, щоб компенсувати ключові недоліки в бойовійспроможності, зокрема погані навички наземного штурму та недоступність авіаціїв Україні.

російські війська використовують важкі артилерійські обстріли, щоб повністюзруйнувати населені пункти, перш ніж захопити їх наземними атаками.

«Триваючий дефіцит артилерійських боєприпасів у росії підірве здатністьросійських військових продовжувати компенсувати інші свої недоліки таобмеження», — йдеться у зведенні.

About it [informs](https://koordshtab.gov.ua/archive/1362)Coordination headquarters of prisoners of war.

Representatives of the coordination headquarters and military parts answered the questions of the relatives.

They discussed the difficulties of official investigations conducting military units of hostilities.

"Service investigations are built on the testimony of servicemen," the representative of the headquarters said. - When there are fighting, you often do not see that you get away with a twin ten meters away. Such are realities. Or sometimes the brothers say that they saw a person injured, incompatible with life, the commander still accounts for the defender missing missing - until the body is not taken away. Because such testimonies are often subjective. And it was advised to return from captivity more than one defender who was considered dead. "

Representatives of the military unit explained that according to the Law on the Protection of Personal data, full information is provided only at the request of the prosecutor's office of the chief protection authorities.

The staff representative noted that the relatives cannot file documents for the status of a participant of hostilities if their loved ones are captured or disappeared. It can only do a serviceman personally after returning from captivity.

- There is a lot of talk about different types of aircraft now. But it must be understood that they need to gain an advantage in the air, and that our aviation technology is not inferior to Russian aircraft. Said the officer. -Now a very big difference with us with the occupiers both in quantities and technologies, for example, such planes as Su-30 and Su-35, which are quite seriously modernized.

The Soviet equipment we have in service has virtually no chance to be able to go. Therefore, the aviation platform is important to us: the ships must be 4+, must have the full range of weapons that NATO countries have - winged, controlled, unmanaged and anti -ship missiles, as well as airplanes.

These are the main characteristics that Western fighters should be in line with. The F-16 Lifetime is the most common aircraft in the world today, it has 25 countries in the most likely candidate for Ukraine. However, I will emphasize - the necessary planes are still now, because up to 20 managed aircraft aircraft every day the enemy is used in the frontline zone of Ukraine. This is a great threat that we have to protrude.

After the beating, he put the victim Dostin and killed him in his head with automatic weapons.

Also, the accused, while intoxicated, jointly entered the house together and ordered the audience to pass four persons to one room. He kept the victims under sight and conducted interrogation for a long time.

Then he ordered everyone to stand in a row one after the other, arguing that it is bad to spend unnecessary cartridges on their murder. After that, imitating the stratified civilians, he fired in the ceiling and left the house, promising to come the next day and shoot everyone.

- Fierce fighting is going on everywhere, especially hot near Marinka and Avdiivka, but nothing can be done there. As for the Bakhmut direction, you are there both in the city itself and in the suburbs, the enemy uses the units and special forces there. The enemy uses the tactics of "burned earth", that is, they destroy absolutely everything. And I must say that they do it so brilliant that they even target the transport that goes towards Bakhmut or from the city, that is, they want to kill people who want to go,-said Anna Malyar.

### ** How to overcome the effects of a stressful life event **

Many military personnel of the Armed Forces and veterans participated in hostilities, risked their lives, were injured, saw death, shootings, were captured, tortured, killed themselves, lost loved ones.

In order to recover from the traumatic events and return to peaceful life, the fighters must cope with emotional experiences and at the same time overcome the perception of the world, begin to trust him and not expect to be dangerous. ** This should be: **

* To realize everything that happened to you and what memories are traumatized the most. Psychoeducation can help, which should inform the nature of trauma, how it affects the brain, cognitive, physical, emotional, spiritual and social spheres. * Timely diagnose post -traumatic stress disorder(PTSR), pay attention to the following symptoms: increased anxiety, constant experiences, night horrors, severe emotional reactions, severe physical reactions, avoiding a reminder of trauma.

If these symptoms do not disappear within a month or more after a potentially traumatic event and interfere with relationships or work, it is likely that PTSD has developed.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-11T97-00-00-04-00/ministr_result.jpg)At a briefing of the Ministers of Defense of Ukraine and the Kingdom of Denmark in Media Centerukraine - Odesa, Alexei Reznikov shared plans to protect civilian citizens from the consequences of a Russian large -scale invasion, namely the release of territories. He noted that the process would consist of several differenties.

- Audit of earth and water will be made after the de -occupation. To date, there are situations when even sea mines fall on the beach, and not Ukrainian. The second is mine equipment. It is not only identification, installation and fixation, but also the possibility of exchanging elements. And the Kingdom of Denmark can help us in this, - he explains.

According to him, Denmark has specialized drones - submarines that have sessers that are able to detect, record and transmit coordinates to the sappers, which can carry out sapper work underwater. In Ukraine, since 2014, the company has been operating, which is represented by the Kingdom of Denmark. This company has great possible expertise to carry out humanitarian demining, that is, the change in areas that are not in the war zone.

Another institution of demining in Ukraine is the SES. They are interested in the demining of civilian infrastructure.

- The SES is a leader in demining, but they do prompt mine. But this is an operational mine. And the full -scale alteration of the same agrarian sector, when our farmers begging: "Memorize the pole, so that we can sow and grow food" is a huge task, ”the minister said.

There is currently an interagency group headed by Yulia Sviridenko, the First Vice Prime Minister and the Minister of Economy. It, as an economist, understands which industries are epiorities in this matter. And the experience of the Kingdom of Denmark will be indispensable for the effective work of our sappers.

- In our plans to create our own potential of at least 5 thousand Ukrainian persons who will be demining. And this is the calculation that the experts from other countries will also be involved, - said Alexei Reznikov.- In Croatia, the war ended 28 years ago. So far, Croatia's territory is not fully unchanged. That is, the Croatian National Center still has a job. They can on average up to 50 square kilometers of land, including rough terrain - rocks, forest huts, etc. - summary Rennikov.
