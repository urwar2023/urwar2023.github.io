_ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians! _
The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.
25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy is hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old - is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment of the monastery. It hurts to see such reports.
Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...
Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.
Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.
Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.
Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.
Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.
And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.Let the sentences on the racists they hear on the dock a bench - law and fair sentences - will be a testimony that the world will still take life and save civilization. And yet there will be a time when children on earth-in Ukraine and anywhere else-will be protected from such evil as Russian evil, and from such aggression.
That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.
And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.
He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.
We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - so that there are no Usian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.
Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!
Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.
Glory to Ukraine!

 It is time when children on earth, including in Ukraine, will be protected from evil such as Russian.
About it in your traditional evening address President of Ukraine Vladimirzelensky said.
Video: Op
_ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians! _
The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.
25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy is hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old - is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment of the monastery. It hurts to see such reports.
Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...
Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.
Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.
Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.
Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.
Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.
And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.Let the sentences on the racists they hear on the dock a bench - law and fair sentences - will be a testimony that the world will still take life and save civilization. And yet there will be a time when children on earth-in Ukraine and anywhere else-will be protected from such evil as Russian evil, and from such aggression.
That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.
And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.
He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.
We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - so that there are no Usian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.
Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!
Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.
Glory to Ukraine!

In the years of Stalin's lawlessness in the territory of Ukraine, thousands of temples of monasteries were destroyed(in the USSR as of 1947-almost 20 thousand), during the time of Russia, 500 sacral structures were destroyed or damaged by Russia against our country. Among them are the nineteenth -century monuments. The exhibition "Brotherhood.Theea. Cathedral ”, which opened at the National Academy of Arts of Ukraine.
At the center of the exposition is the history of the Epiphany Cathedral of the Kiev-Brat Monastery, built in the style of Ukrainian Baroque in 1690-1693 at the place of the wooden church at the expense of Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Not only the Baroque iconostasis, but also the interiors, which painted the artist I. Kvyatkovsky and the Italian master J. B. Scotti, was famous for the Penty -Red Stone Temple. The coat of arms of the sponsor - Hetman Ivan Mazepa, destroyed after 1709, was placed. There were several historical relics in the cathedral -(Vyshgorod)The icon of Our Lady of the seventeenth century. Mother Ivan Mazepa.
Near the southern wall of the shrine was a grave with the tombstone of Hetman Petrasagaydachny, near the northeastern Absid of the temple-the burial of historians of the stead, a pilgrim and a traveler, who was called the Ukrainian Odyssey, the author of the book "Traveling in the Holy Places of East from 1723 to 1447."
In 1935, the cathedral, which was one of the largest structures of Kyiv at the time, and the architectural dominant of Podil, together with the bell tower, leveled with the land-the most foundations staged a place of the Kiev Navy and erected a residential building for teachers of the institution.Photographic materials also tell about other shrines of Kiev, destroyed in the 20-30's of the last century by the Bolsheviks, who justified their barbaric bricks, as evidenced by the documents presented in the exposition.
The fate of the Epiphany Cathedral was repeated in the 21st century other temples, which were bombed, shot from tanks, undermined, arranged in them. The horrific crimes of the Russians against the spiritual heritage and culture of Ukraine are part of Russia's imperial policy. This is eloquently evidenced by the installation of the National Museum of Dignity Revolution and the National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War. In the installation of the "fragments" of the Museum of the Maidan presented things of the temples, destroyed in 2022. They were collected during the expeditions within the museum of the Heritage Rescue Staff. In particular, the exposition presents fragmentation of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary(The village of Vykivka, Zhytomyr region)Tasso-Georgian monastery(The village of Dolinonetsk region).
«Виставка, яка розповідає про Богоявленський собор та руйнування храмів підчас війни, надзвичайно важлива сьогодні. Адже це не лише про фіксаціюзлочинів, а й про велику надію на дослідження та неминучу відбудовуукраїнських храмів. Частина з них пережила Першу та Другу світові війни, алеїх було знищено в теперішній війні. І цей факт не може не вражати. В окремійінсталяції на виставці ми представили 18 експонатів зі збірки Музею Майдану.Усі ці речі зібрано протягом минулого року в експедиціях команди на звільненітериторії», — зазначив генеральний директор Національного музею РеволюціїГідності Ігор Пошивайло.

 About it in interview The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Gavrilov informed the publication of Politico. He also urged Beijing to refrain from supplying dual -use goods to Moscow.
According to the newspaper, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr Gavrilov reported that Ukraine seeks to become a member of NATO in the shortest possible time of posting a military victory over Russia. Thus, he once again voiced Kyiv about giving Ukraine a clear road card for the Alliance.
It is reported in an interview that in the sidelines of the Shanghai dialogue in Singaporevodimir Gavrilov also urged Beijing to refrain from sending military exhibitions to Moscow, stating that it is "clear" that another trade in the trading between China and Russia will continue.
According to the publication, the future role of Ukraine in NATO has become a hot topic precisely before holding the July summit of the Alliance leaders in Lithuania. Currently, Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries have called on the US and Germany to provide a clear plan for the approval of Kiev for NATO membership.
Politico also reminds that on Saturday, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that he "makes no sense" to go to NATO summit next month, if Ukraine did not "recognize" or "a signal" about its post -war status of the District Alliance.
"We would like to hear a plan or a road card, or a list of actions that both sides - NATO and Ukraine should take place - to achieve membership in the Alliance, a very short period of time," said Vladimir Gavrilov.
He acknowledged that it is impossible until the war continues, "at the same time, we must understand that after our victory, our process of entering the block should be very, very short."
According to him, NATO should provide Ukraine with a list of steps that need to be made "with a clear confirmation that Ukraine is a legitimate candidate" for membership in the Alliance.
Meanwhile, according to Politico, according to Volodymyr Gavrilov, it will be held to Ukrainian talks with NATO about the "security system" for the transition period to the Alliance:
“Such guarantees should include:
the obligations of NATO countries to help Ukraine win in the war;
support of the Ukrainian economy;
"Support for the continuation of sanctions and other forms of pressure on Russia."“Yes, they continue to sell ordinary commercial things to support the Russian economy. This is understandable, but we hope that they will not sell to Russia weapons as Iran. This is important, ”he said.
“China also adheres to certain international sanctions against Russia, and the India. Therefore, when it comes to dual -use equipment, I think that China nor India ... They are not interested in violating this kind of sanctions, because they are dependent on technologies from Europe and the US, - said Gavrilov.
China has repeatedly denied reports of weapons to Russia, although Beijing promised a "boundless" partnership with Moscow shortly before Russia President Vladimir Putin began a total invasion of Ukraine.

According to the newspaper, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr Gavrilov reported that Ukraine seeks to become a member of NATO in the shortest possible time of posting a military victory over Russia.
 
Саме майбутня роль України в НАТО стала гарячою темою перед проведеннямлипневого саміту лідерів Альянсу в Литві.
«Ми б хотіли почути план або дорожню карту, або перелік дій, які маютьздійснити обидві сторони — НАТО і Україна — для досягнення членства в Альянсіза дуже короткий період часу», — сказав Володимир Гаврилов.
Він визнав, що це неможливо, поки триває війна, «в той же час, ми повиннірозуміти, що після нашої перемоги наш процес вступу до блоку має бути дуже-дуже коротким».
За його словами, НАТО має надати Україні перелік кроків, які необхідноздійснити «з чітким підтвердженням того, що Україна є легітимним кандидатом»на членство в Альянсі.
На думку Володимира Гаврилова, як зазначає POLITICO, Україна вестимепереговори з НАТО про «систему гарантій безпеки» на перехідний період дочленства в Альянсі.
«Такі гарантії повинні включати: зобов'язання країн НАТО допомогти Україніперемогти у війні; підтримку української економіки; підтримку продовженнясанкцій та інших форм тиску на росію», — підкреслив заступник Міністра оборониУкраїни.

_ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!_ 
The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.
25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy was hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old, is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment is a member. It hurts to see such reports.
Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...
Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.
Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.
Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.
Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.
Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.
And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.
I am grateful to all in the world who helps the work of the International Criminal Court, his team in investigating Russian crimes on Ukrainian land. And someone helps us to organize a special tribunal on the crime of Russia's aggression in the contrary of Ukraine - about the original crime that gave birth to all other terribles of this war.That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.
And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.
He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.
We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - that there are no U -Russian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.
Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!
Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.
Glory to Ukraine!
