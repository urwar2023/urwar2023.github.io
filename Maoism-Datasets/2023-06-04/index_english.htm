<p>About it in your traditional <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6464">evening address</a>President of Ukraine Vladimirzelensky said.</p>
<p>Video: Op</p>
<p>_ <strong> Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.</p>
<p>25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy is hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old - is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment of the monastery. It hurts to see such reports.</p>
<p>Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...</p>
<p>Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.</p>
<p>Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.</p>
<p>Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.</p>
<p>And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.Let the sentences on the racists they hear on the dock a bench - law and fair sentences - will be a testimony that the world will still take life and save civilization. And yet there will be a time when children on earth-in Ukraine and anywhere else-will be protected from such evil as Russian evil, and from such aggression.</p>
<p>That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.</p>
<p>And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.</p>
<p>He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.</p>
<p>We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - so that there are no Usian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, he wrote about it in <a href="https://t.me/dmytro_lubinetzs/2635">telegram.</a>‚ÄúToday we honor the memory of children who died as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. Since 2014, this is a special date for all Ukrainians when we are wearing innocent children who died or injured through the war.

<p>As Lubin emphasized, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna">war</a>In Ukraine has been going on since 2014. "From then to February 24, 2022, 1522 were killed, 146 were injured, and since the beginning of a full -scale invasion of the war, 485 children have been given, more than a thousand young Ukrainians were injured in a different severity," the Commissioner said.</p>
<p>However, he stressed, this is not the final data, since the number of children affected in Mariupol in other territories of Donetsk Talugansk regions, where active fighting is constantly underway, is still unknown.</p>
<p>From the beginning of a full -scale invasion, Russia has released more than 5,000 missiles with almost 3.5 thousand aviation blows in the Ukrainian territory, and the aggressor has released more than half a thousand Idronov missiles in the last month, Ombudsman said.</p>
<p>According to this statistics, he emphasized the stories of little Ukrainians who could live, rejoice, create their own families and build a peaceful country. The smallest child who died from the shelling of the maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhibul only 2 days from birth.</p>
<p>Even on International Children's Day, the Russians made a massive rocket launcher that a 9-year-old girl was killed with her mother. "Aggressions do not understand our feelings, they are fighting with children," Lubinets said.</p>

<p>She said this in an interview <a href="https://rus.err.ee/1608997795/kaja-kallas-v-singapure-nato-ugrozhaet-ne-bezopasnosti-rossii-a-rossijskomu-imperializmu">ERR</a>After a speech at the Shanngry-La Dialogue forum, Uzingapore, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe most important references of my speech were related to the refutation of the narrative concerning NATO. As an example, I use my country. When we are my occupation, we have done everything so that it will never happen again. This means that we should never stay alone, ‚ÄùCallas said.</p>
<p>According to her, the entry of Estonia to <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato">NATO</a>was a free choice of people, not imposed on the side.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey talk about NATO expansion as a process that is somehow not related to the will of Ukraine, but I refute it. Russia behaves as the last colonial state, which is actually trying to colonize and expand its empire. This is a topic that may find a response here, which they will understand here, ‚Äùthe Prime Minister added.</p>

"Nattov is not the safety of Russia, but Russian imperialism," Callas is convinced.</p>
<p>According to her, the third important topic of her speech concerned the reaction to the war, which, in turn, gives a signal to the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the use of aggression as a tool pays off, because as a result, the UAC becomes more areas or more assets, then other countries that are more powerful will also use this tool. In this case, we are not in the world, based on international law, but of the Audit Order, based on who is stronger, ‚ÄùCallas stressed.</p>
<p>The politician also recalled the need to establish taps with those who can be trusted. In her opinion, it is very important to activate cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the Association of State-Eastern Asia, so that joint efforts to reduce the dependence of attached partners.As reported by Ukrinform, on June 2-4 in Singapore there is a large-scale safe forum "Dialogue of Shangri-La", at which the Russian Anti-Ukraine war is one of the main topics.</p>
<p>Participants include US, China and EU representatives, including the heads of the Tavis Landmarks of Defense Agency, military, diplomats, weapons manufacturers of safety weapons.</p>

<p>According to sources, the Singapore government has been holding similar meetings for several years as part of the forum, but have not been reported before.</p>
<p>It is noted that in particular the United States was represented by the director of the national intelligence Avril Heins. Also among others were the chairman of the Indian Agency for Intelligence Abroad, Research and Analysis Wing Samanthoel and China's intelligence representative.

The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Havrylov was at the forum, but said that he was not present at the exploration meeting, the agency writes.</p>
<p>"Meeting is an important event on an international shadow agenda. Due to a number of involved countries, it is not a festival of crafts, but rather a way to help a deeper understanding of intentions and results," said awareness.</p>

<p>About it in your traditional <a href="https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6464">evening address</a>President of Ukraine Vladimirzelensky said.</p>
<p>Video: Op</p>
<p>_ <strong> Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.</p>
<p>25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy is hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old - is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment of the monastery. It hurts to see such reports.</p>
<p>Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...</p>
<p>Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.</p>
<p>Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.</p>
<p>Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.</p>
<p>And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.Let the sentences on the racists they hear on the dock a bench - law and fair sentences - will be a testimony that the world will still take life and save civilization. And yet there will be a time when children on earth-in Ukraine and anywhere else-will be protected from such evil as Russian evil, and from such aggression.</p>
<p>That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.</p>
<p>And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.</p>
<p>He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.</p>
<p>We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - so that there are no Usian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>In the years of Stalin's lawlessness in the territory of Ukraine, thousands of temples of monasteries were destroyed(in the USSR as of 1947-almost 20 thousand), during the time of Russia, 500 sacral structures were destroyed or damaged by Russia against our country. Among them are the nineteenth -century monuments. The exhibition "Brotherhood.Theea. Cathedral ‚Äù, which opened at the National Academy of Arts of Ukraine.</p>
<p>At the center of the exposition is the history of the Epiphany Cathedral of the Kiev-Brat Monastery, built in the style of Ukrainian Baroque in 1690-1693 at the place of the wooden church at the expense of Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Not only the Baroque iconostasis, but also the interiors, which painted the artist I. Kvyatkovsky and the Italian master J. B. Scotti, was famous for the Penty -Red Stone Temple. The coat of arms of the sponsor - Hetman Ivan Mazepa, destroyed after 1709, was placed. There were several historical relics in the cathedral -(Vyshgorod)The icon of Our Lady of the seventeenth century. Mother Ivan Mazepa.</p>
<p>Near the southern wall of the shrine was a grave with the tombstone of Hetman Petrasagaydachny, near the northeastern Absid of the temple-the burial of historians of the stead, a pilgrim and a traveler, who was called the Ukrainian Odyssey, the author of the book "Traveling in the Holy Places of East from 1723 to 1447."</p>
<p>In 1935, the cathedral, which was one of the largest structures of Kyiv at the time, and the architectural dominant of Podil, together with the bell tower, leveled with the land-the most foundations staged a place of the Kiev Navy and erected a residential building for teachers of the institution.Photographic materials also tell about other shrines of Kiev, destroyed in the 20-30's of the last century by the Bolsheviks, who justified their barbaric bricks, as evidenced by the documents presented in the exposition.</p>
<p>The fate of the Epiphany Cathedral was repeated in the 21st century other temples, which were bombed, shot from tanks, undermined, arranged in them. The horrific crimes of the Russians against the spiritual heritage and culture of Ukraine are part of Russia's imperial policy. This is eloquently evidenced by the installation of the National Museum of Dignity Revolution and the National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War. In the installation of the "fragments" of the Museum of the Maidan presented things of the temples, destroyed in 2022. They were collected during the expeditions within the museum of the Heritage Rescue Staff. In particular, the exposition presents fragmentation of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary(The village of Vykivka, Zhytomyr region)Tasso-Georgian monastery(The village of Dolinonetsk region).</p>

Colonel Sergey Cherevaty, a reporter of the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces. According to the speaker, the removal of units of the criminal UVC "Wagner" is continuing from under Bakhmut. They are replaced by the airborne parts of the Russian.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Rashist doctrine, these troops are used for break -in Plitzdarms. It is a kind of "ambulance" that covers the most "hot" areas of the front in order to achieve at least some intermediate result. But the units are currently undergoing significant losses and completed at the expense of mobilized. I would like to do that we have already dealt with these units and have information about their tactics. Therefore, we will not break the events on the front.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sergiy Cherevaty reported that in the Bakhmut direction, 426 artillery strikes, 3 air strikes, were held in the Bakhmut direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>For our part, the enemy's fire, intelligence and exploration continues. There are some preparatory measures, the counterattacks of the Ukrainian units are only carried out when we are confident that they will be successful and as safe for personnel. Thus, during the day 96 invaders were destroyed, 131 were injured, 5 enemy UAVs were shot down, 2 tanks and BMPs were shot down, 3-guns, anti-aircraft missile complex, and 2 ammunition deposits were destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the spokesman of the Eastern Group of the Armed Forces, the Kupyansko-Limanskaya remained the leader in the number of artillery blows. 601 shelling, 6 combat clashes, 11 aircraft were tamped a day. 54 invaders were destroyed, 59 were injured, 1 rashist was killed. 3 enemy tanks, 2 BMPs, self -propelled acacia artillery installation, reactive system of hail, 2 mortars and 2 UAVs, 1 visual observation station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Undoubtedly, in this direction, the invaders are trying to take the initiative. They take offensive actions to develop success and continue the movement for the more occupation of Lugansk and Donetsk regions, but our units control this direction, so all their attempts end in failure, - said Sergei.</li>

<p>The enemy, strengthening their groups of storms "storm Z", is highly stated from prisoners prepared for assault actions in special camps, went on to conduct offensive actions in the areas .

<p>This makes it possible to have a real situation on the ground, not by reporting reports. In the course of live communication with the commanders of the units, we developed and implement new approaches and visions of the most likely achievement of successful areas of the front.</p>
<p>Each such actions require careful planning, painstaking training for their practical implementation, that is, concerted actions of the headquarters of the units for successful performance of combat missions.</p>
<p>Then even the numerical advantage does not help the enemy.

He also urged Beijing to refrain from supplying dual -use goods to Moscow.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr Gavrilov reported that Ukraine seeks to become a member of NATO in the shortest possible time of posting a military victory over Russia. Thus, he once again voiced Kyiv about giving Ukraine a clear road card for the Alliance.</p>
<p>It is reported in an interview that in the sidelines of the Shanghai dialogue in Singaporevodimir Gavrilov also urged Beijing to refrain from sending military exhibitions to Moscow, stating that it is "clear" that another trade in the trading between China and Russia will continue.</p>
<p>According to the publication, the future role of Ukraine in NATO has become a hot topic precisely before holding the July summit of the Alliance leaders in Lithuania. Currently, Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries have called on the US and Germany to provide a clear plan for the approval of Kiev for NATO membership.</p>
<p>Politico also reminds that on Saturday, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that he "makes no sense" to go to NATO summit next month, if Ukraine did not "recognize" or "a signal" about its post -war status of the District Alliance.</p>
<p>"We would like to hear a plan or a road card, or a list of actions that both sides - NATO and Ukraine should take place - to achieve membership in the Alliance, a very short period of time," said Vladimir Gavrilov.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that it is impossible until the war continues, "at the same time, we must understand that after our victory, our process of entering the block should be very, very short."</p>
<p>According to him, NATO should provide Ukraine with a list of steps that need to be made "with a clear confirmation that Ukraine is a legitimate candidate" for membership in the Alliance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Politico, according to Volodymyr Gavrilov, it will be held to Ukrainian talks with NATO about the "security system" for the transition period to the Alliance:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch guarantees should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the obligations of NATO countries to help Ukraine win in the war;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support of the Ukrainian economy;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Support for the continuation of sanctions and other forms of pressure on Russia."‚ÄúYes, they continue to sell ordinary commercial things to support the Russian economy. This is understandable, but we hope that they will not sell to Russia weapons as Iran. This is important, ‚Äùhe said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina also adheres to certain international sanctions against Russia, and the India. Therefore, when it comes to dual -use equipment, I think that China nor India ... They are not interested in violating this kind of sanctions, because they are dependent on technologies from Europe and the US, - said Gavrilov.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly denied reports of weapons to Russia, although Beijing promised a "boundless" partnership with Moscow shortly before Russia President Vladimir Putin began a total invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong> _ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>The rescue operation in the city of Pidhorodne in the Dnieper region has already ended, the Derosian rocket has destroyed the houses.</p>
<p>25 people were injured, five of them children. David, he is 6 years old - heavily, the guy was hospitalized. Denis, he is 11 years old, is also a serious condition, hospitalized. Alexander, 15 years old, is also a serious condition. Lisa, 17 years old, is an outpatient treatment. Kira, she is 10 years old, is a mine-explosive trauma, the treatment is a member. It hurts to see such reports.</p>
<p>Lisa, 2 years old, she was killed by this Russian rocket. Iskander probably. My condolences to my family and loved ones ...</p>
<p>Russian terror took away the lives of hundreds of our children, and only during February 24, during a full -scale war, is known for the death of 485 children. Ceyster, which we can formally confirm knowing the data of each child.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the real number is greater. Every time we liberate our land of sprouting invaders, we learn the terrible truth about occupation. How many people, how many children are in the burials in the occupied territory - in the Mogilets of this war, this aggression. And how many still under the ruins in Russian Ukrainian cities and villages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have complete information about hundreds of thousands of children who have been deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children in deportation have managed to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that we are aware of at least 19 505 deported Ukrainian children, and it is only part of all those of our little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who are still in the enemy. Which we have to return.</p>
<p>Today in our country there is a day of memory of children who died as a result of Russian aggression. From the age of 14. Children who would be alive if Kupbandites in the Kremlin, in Moscow, did not feel themselves in the leaders who allegedly have to rule the fate of peoples.</p>
<p>Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about that. All the necessary legal institutions work for the cure.</p>
<p>And today, on this memory day, I want to thank everyone in the world who is more supported for the sake of justice. For the sake of punishing anyone who brought the land of terror, everyone who kills and deport children and adults.</p>
<p>I am grateful to all in the world who helps the work of the International Criminal Court, his team in investigating Russian crimes on Ukrainian land. And someone helps us to organize a special tribunal on the crime of Russia's aggression in the contrary of Ukraine - about the original crime that gave birth to all other terribles of this war.That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of responsibility to be a powerful mention of every life that was taken away by evil, Russia.</p>
<p>And part of this responsibility is a mandatory part of the Esanction today. Sanctions of the world that force Russia to pay the price for what it does.</p>
<p>He held a special meeting on sanctions today. GUR, external intelligence service, government, office. They analyzed in great detail how Russia bypasses the sanction and who helps her. Different countries, different companies without which Russia has not been able to deny terror, including rockets. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, it is possible to enter international sanction regimes.</p>
<p>We see every direction of bypassing existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we have to close all such directions - together with partners - that there are no U -Russian missiles, in Russian weapons of the free world. Necessary will be.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who helps us fight aggression!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers!And thank you for today on the forefront.</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

<p>The publication notes that Vladimir Gavrilov, answering questions about the sale of China's selling Russian drones, said that this concerns more "commercial drones". He also urged Beijing to refrain from the abuse of weapons and dual -use goods to Moscow, stating that it is "clear" that another trade cooperation between China and Rosiyia will continue to continue.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, they continue to sell ordinary commercial things to support the Russian economy. This is understandable, but we hope that they will not sell to Russia weapons as Iran. This is important, ‚Äùhe said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina also adheres to certain international sanctions against Russia, and the India. Therefore, when it comes to dual -use equipment, I think that China nor India ... are not interested in violating this kind of sanctions, because they are dependent on technologies from Europe and the US, ‚ÄùVladimir Gavrilov said.</p>
<p>The publication reminded that China has repeatedly denied the message of weapons to Russia, although Beijing promised a "boundless" partnership to be able to do long before Russian President Putin launched a total loss in Ukraine last year.</p>
