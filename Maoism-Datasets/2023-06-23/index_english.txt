 Deterous Ukrainians, Ukrainians! 
Today was a very busy day.
First, they briefed for partner countries about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya atomic station. There were representatives of the countries of the Great Seven, "Grand Twenty", representatives of international organizations. Here in the office. A available information has been provided from the GUR, from the commissioner, from our diplomats.
Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier prepares. Everyone who knows has to act. Of course, after a Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, terrorists on other dams and energy objects of the old one in the world should not have any illusions about Russia. It is Russia that is now the brigal center of cynicism, and from there may be any order for any excellent, which they expect to mask under one or another catastrophe. The world has a complicated power to prevent any radiation incidents and, moreover, a radiation disaster. Everyone understands that intelligence of different countries can give corresponding signals, they can press. This is required.
We will continue to inform partners. Information will also be provided to those countries that have some neutrality even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask, who is unnecessary, and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the lightisaraz can help, and what to do is quite known.
Full de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear station is required. And anyone who has fulfilled their eyes on Russia's occupation of such an object, on the mines of Russia, the territory of the structures of the nuclear power plant, in fact contributes not only to this Russian gun, but terror in general. And today I instructed the Minister of Internal Affairs Klimenko Igor to take all necessary measures, all the necessary work with our people on all available risks. And in the near future it will be done.
Today, the SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs have spoken appropriate security issues - ITe concerning the Zaporizhzhya station, and what concerns the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Station. We do our best to connect as much as possible and means to pressure and influence on the terrorist state. There was also a separate report of internal affairs to support people and life in the Kherson region and the greetings of our south, which were affected by the destruction of the Kakhovsky Damage.He also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue the correspondence, and there will be new steps. Obviously, there can be no spiritual communication with the terrorist state and those who justify the murder, murder of Ukrainians and cover evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror is custom. And we will reach the moment when all the dependence on Russia, which is trying to manipulate somewhere, will be destroyed.
One more.
I want to give especially to all those who, even at that time, even in such circumstances, that our people and our country are small cultural power. Today, the next book Aresenal began in Kyiv. "Arsenal" is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. What makes people people. What makes humanity stronger. What protects and through time spreads our experience - everyone and everyone, all of our Ukraine, all our Ukraine, all our Europe, all our humanity. Bellas, if you have the opportunity, visit one of these days Book Arsenal and always support cultural power.
I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone who is now in the battles - in the south, in the east, in Zaporozhye, in the Donetsk region, in Luhansk region. Thank you!
Thank you all who help Ukraine and protect their lives and humanity with us!
Glory to Ukraine!

In two separate cases, last year, railway wagons that transported tens of kilograms of smokeless gunpowder-sufficient fuel to produce at least 80 million ammunition-traveled across the Chinese-Russian border in the remote city of Zabaikalsk.
The gunpowder was delivered by the Chinese state company Poly Technologies, which previously imposed sanctions for its global sales of rocket technologies and Iran support.
The destination of the cargo was the Barnaul plant of ammunition, fabricaboe -supplies in Central Russia, which repeatedly supplied the ammunition government.
These, not previously registered, the facts were discovered by the American aggregator of the trade -long Import Genius.

Children who cannot sleep that do not receive psychological help because it is difficult to find. A whole generation of children will bear this injury to the end of their lives, "- said Kleine Herzen Pascal, during opening the exhibition.

They also could not speak Ukrainian symbols or speak Ukrainian," he added.
For his part, the second secretary of the Embassy of Ukraine in Austria Nazar Stetsyshyn during the opening of the exhibition emphasized that the aggression and terror of Russia bear a lot of destruction of buildings, but also the deprivation of Ukrainian children of the main right -hand people, above all the most important - the right to life.
"Russia has deprived this right to life for at least 483 Ukrainian children, only those figures that we know exactly. Russia has killed these children. In addition, a very painful topic for Ukraine is a forced deportation In the war against Ukraine. But the crime is special, because it is directed about those who are most evident. And this crime is happening here and now. We must save these children, "he said.

According to Filipenko, during the last rescue mission it was possible to return 8 children from an orphanage who were illegally removed from the territory of Ukraine. "We have identified their location thanks to the children who were returned before. And two weeks ago, these eight children managed to return. We are now raising the question of their location," he said.

"This means that we know their name, first name and patronymic, birth dates and approximate location. But numerical children are at times greater, the exact number of no one knows. Many children continue to be abducted by Russia in the occupied territories," -said he.
Filipenko indicated that the Government of Ukraine cannot work directly with the authorities of the aggressor state in the issue of returning deported children , since diplomatic relations were destroyed, and therefore the main work was assumed by the organization of civil society.

Often, the route can be more than 4 thousand km. Each rescue mission lasts from three weeks to a month, taking into account the preparation of documents.
According to Filipenko, on average, the cost of returning one child is about $ 4,000. That is why the Fund is currently being conducted, incl. abroad, a campaign for accumulation of funds for their activities to return to the growth of stolen children.
"The Russians gave children only to their parents and on the basis of all properly decorated doctors. In the event that they are about orphans, they were followed by an official representative from the orphanage from which they were abducted, with a proxy," - said Save Ukraine representative.
According to him, the Russian side has always tried to prevent the return to Ukraine, and with the issuance of an international criminal court of the arrestine on the partputin of various obstacles on the part of the Russians only increased. According to representatives of the UKRAINE, data on all cases with the dismissal of stolen children, as well as their testimony, are further sent, in particular, to the office of the ISS Prosecutor.

Deliveries that have not been reported before, between the state Chinese company, the Russian Ammunition Plant last year, cause a new way about Beijing's role in Moscow's war against Ukraine, the newspaper notes.
In two separate cases, last year, railway wagons that transported tens of kilograms of smokeless gunpowder-sufficient fuel to produce at least 80 million ammunition-traveled across the Chinese-Russian border in the remote city of Zabaikalsk.
The gunpowder was delivered by the Chinese state company Poly Technologies, which previously imposed sanctions for its global sales of rocket technologies and Iran support.
The destination of the cargo was the Barnaul plant of ammunition, fabricaboe -supplies in Central Russia, which repeatedly supplied the ammunition government.
These, not previously registered, the facts were discovered by the American aggregator of the trade -long Import Genius.
US officials have expressed concern that Beijing could send Moscow "death", although they did not say directly that China had made such plants, the newspaper reports. Secretary of State USA Anthony Blinken during a speech in Beijing was that China assured the United States that she did not provide fatal assistance to Russian for war against Ukraine.

Poly Technologies is a child company China Poly Group Corporation owned by the China Government.

The Barnaul Plant Factory in December came under EU sanctions. The information from the sources indicates that the plant could serve as a training camp related to Wagner PEC.
There is no direct evidence that smokeless powder has a direct connection with the war in Ukraine. Poly Technologies wrote that gunpowder is needed to make "hunting rounds of a foreign sample". However, the analyst Brian Carlson of the Security Central Committee says that it is a militant.

The same applies to situations that have not yet happened. Panic and fear are the kind of enemy.
Today in his speech, President Zelensky did not say anything new.
Russia is a terrorist country, from which, as well as from a monkey with a grenade, you can think of anything. The threat was, is and will be, until we finally will not win.
However, you need to be ready. Always and to everything. Therefore, we share with you the basic safety authorities at radiation danger.
 P.S. Ioda prevention is only required in the event of an accident that has occurred. Iodidalia is toxic to the body and "not working" in advance. 
So again: don't panic or take ill -advised steps.

 A certain decrease in the intensity of rocket strokes of the Russian Federation in the territory of Ukraine in June is comparable to the savings of weapons and changing the tactics of the aggressor: the enemy combines the use of different types of weapons, uses false-goals to highlight the Ukrainian air defense and tries to maintain the frequency of attacks.
Vadim Skibitsky told about it, reports Main Directorate of Intelligence of Defense of Ukraine.
“The blows will continue despite the fact that(Russians)They started to save rocket weapons. The campaign in the fall and winter, when they used one blow of 80-100 missiles, exhausted the arsenals and stocks of the Russian Federation, ”Vadimskibitsky said, reminding that the main purpose of the Russian rocket terror was the disruption of the active actions of the Ukrainian army on the front.
The GUR representative confirmed that during the war Russia was able to increase the volume of winged rockets "Caliber" and X-101 several times: from 10 to 30-40 units per month. However, due to the exhaustion of rockets during the previous rocket terror against Ukraine, new products have been sent to war infactly from the conveyor.
"Now we record that the produced immediately goes to the troops for further use: for example, winged missiles from the last blows - we already see the eating residues - we were made in April this year," Vadimskibitsky said.
He also reported the results of studies of the downed Russian rockets for foreign components.
"The largest foreign components that are critical of the Russian Federation are in two ways is" Iskander "and" dagger ": nearly fifty components of electronic deed in these missiles, foreign production," said the representative of Ukrainian military intelligence.
According to Vadim Skibitsky, Ukraine is now actively working with partners, to exacerbate the supply of these components to the Russian Federation, to strengthen the sanction pressure of the aggressor, and to strengthen the Ukrainian air defense system, which is one of the key stations of the state.

 _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians! _
Held a NSDC meeting. Three issues of the agenda. The most important thing: Ministryklimenko and Kamyshin presented the first summary results of inspection of the shelters of the Uregions of our country: Klimenko - throughout the country, Kamyshin - about Kiev. In general, today they considered the situation with shelters in regions, areas, cities that enemy terrorizes.
The conclusions are disappointing. Almost all over the country. It is Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv, Idnopro, and Konotop, and Bila Tserkva, and many other cities. Particularly cynical tagnebic situation in those cities that have considerable financial resources, but unfortunately, are other priorities. Personnel decisions will be.
Affordable and reliable shelters across the country should be and will be priority for leaders at all levels. Safety is the first priority.
The Prosecutor General informed the NSDC about the claim of the prosecutor's office to return the shelters that were illegally withdrawn from the property of the communities. Today - more than 400 such claims around the country, work is ongoing.
Prime Minister Smigal also reported on a difficult situation with the state of bridge bridges. The largest cities, including Kyiv. The state is frank. There is a decision of the NSDC to create a commission to check all bridges, overpasses all over the country. Responsible for checking the Vice Prime Minister.
The second point of the agenda is the courts.
Vice Prime Minister Stephanyshina informed the NSDC on the intermediate oral evaluation of the European Commission of our institutional progress, in particular, this concerns perfect reform.
Much has been done. But we consider this only as the necessary basis for our consistent obligations to Ukrainians about justice. It is obvious that the former Supreme Court's former chairman and other such situations in judicial system have a stiffer state policy regarding the requirements for judges, to all who work in the justice system and their liability for violations. Cordual violations.
The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine appealed to the NSDC. Today we considered the appeals.The following. There must be verification of judges' integrity. And not just before the appointment. Unfortunately, time may change people who have been a positive conclusion in the courts. And I think it is worth checking, in particular, using a lie detector.
It is very important: we have to strengthen the role of jury court, to expand cases of its application in Ukraine. And this is not just about democracy, it is about the fairness.
Separately discussed the issues of protection of business and investors in courts. Cefoundamental task. A strong economy is a protected investment, a cigarette protection of property rights. And it should be. If you need a separate mechanism that will protect the business, investors, we have to provide it. There are responsible proposals.
Of course, we discussed the tasks that we have to accomplish by the end of the year to fully implement each European Commission recommendation to start negotiating the Uevroseyuz. For each such direction, the NSDC gave the necessary protocol orders. I am sure that they all realistically fulfill them.
Today is exactly the year as Ukraine has acquired the status of a candidate for entry into the European Union, the goal is to start membership negotiations. Ukraine will definitely do its part of work.
Glory to Ukraine!
