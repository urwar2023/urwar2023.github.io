Вона регулярно через месенджер повідомляла співробітнику силспеціальних операцій головного управління генерального штабу зс рф інформаціющодо результатів та місць ракетних ударів, завданих ворогом по населенихпунктах Донеччини.

Обвинувачена усвідомлювала, що ця інформація буде використана ворогом дляподальшого проведення розвідувально-підривної діяльності на шкоду інтересам тадержавній безпеці України. За це агресор, у разі захоплення регіону,гарантував їй керівну посаду в окупаційній адміністрації.
У цій діяльності обвинуваченій допомагала подруга, теж жителька Краматорська,яка в силу своєї професійної діяльності володіла інформацією про місцядислокації ЗСУ.
Обидві прихильниці «руського міра» наразі перебувають під вартою.

 The University of Hague, the Zorgvliet residential district, conducted a support for Ukraine - a pedestrian and bicycle area near the buildings of the Russian Embassy in the Netherlands "Glory to Ukraine".
According to the Ukrinform correspondent in the Hague, therefore the Dutch is to demonstrate their solidarity and support for Ukraine, where everything brings up a cruel full -scale military invasion of the Russian Federation.

 “As you can see, there are buildings of the official representation of the vibrant regime, which is the Embassy of the Russian Federation. And we thought that it would be good in solidarity and support to name this small lane, located next to the Russian Embassy, which has no name now -to predict it to the Glory to Ukraine lane. Laantje in the Dutch means a lap, a small lane. So it was our main idea. We are a Hague city, but we are also the Netherlands citizens. And as you know, the Netherlands is actively supporting, let's call it the Anti -Putin Alliance. And they were aware that it could be a good gesture right now, after a visit to the Netherlands. We are proud of what they have done. I mean it is a sign of support for Ukraine and its people and, if you say, its armed forces. This is very important, ”said in a comment to Ukrinform Dutch Dzheims de Buh, one of the initiators of the action.“Hundreds of children go this little street every day, as there are many schools. They go bicycles and walk this lane to schools and sports sites. And we would like to be reminded of them every time, however, that they and we are privileged to live here, in the Netherlands, where there is no war, ”the activist said.
Two Ukrainian women were invited to the opening of the name "Glory of Ukraine".
“When there is a Glory of Ukraine Sign in Hague, it is a very large signs of solidarity, a sign of support. Of course, it would be best if the Russian police received a mail or ordered something to "Glory to Ukraine" - a Tsebul would be perfect, but this is the next step, "Bun said.
In her turn, the Ukrainian Olga King, who was in Ukraine in Ukraine in Ukraine, said that for Ukrainians who were forced to leave their own homes, the Glory of Ukraine is a small victory.
“I think I will now say from tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are now in the Netherlands because of the war, that it is a small victory. Seeing Russian Glory to Ukraine is a sense of filling and inspiration. Mandicity with gratitude to the Dutch community that supports us. It is necessary for "Glory to Ukraine" to sound everywhere with the words "We won", -the king added in a comment to Ukrinform.

The Glory of Ukraine Sign was established within the framework of the action organized by the residential area of the Zorgvliet.

 The Ukrainian Casteron considers the wrong decision of the EU to introduce a ban on the import of Ukrainian agricultural products to five EU countries, which are the neighbors of Ukraine, and proposes to seek market solutions for this problem.
The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine Mykola Solsky stated this in Brussels in Brussels during the communication with the press in the results of the non -formal working lunch within the EU Council of Ministers for Agricultural Economy and Fisheries.
“Today we had a meeting with many ministers and representatives European Commission . We have outlined the prohibition of import of Ukrainian agricultural products after June 5. We are against it, this is not a good way, ”the Ukrainian government officer said.
Read also: Solsk D discussed with the Croatian Minister of Exports of Ukrainian Agro -Production He noted that within a few weeks after the prohibition on imported EU countries, there were huge difficulties with the functioning of the Black Sea Grain Corridor caused by Russia's actions, due to its Ukrainian side could not load the vessels with grain for decades.
“We are very grateful to our Turkish partners and united nations, as well as to all partners for the opportunity to continue this corridor for another few months. At the same time, we understand that the Russians carefully monitor the situation, they try to take advantage of it. We do not want to give them can use this, ”Solsky said.
Answering the question of Ukrinform correspondent, the Minister explained that there will be no existing restrictions on Ukrainian agrarian imports until at least 5th, and this will not be a good idea to continue them in the future. This applies to the first place, such crops as sunflower seeds, corn, wheat and rapeseed. The Minister recalled that Ukraine actively traded rapeseed seeds with EU seed . At the same time, Solsky emphasized that the Ukrainian side is as interested in finding a constructive solution.“Countries that have introduced these restrictions(Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria Irumunia - ed.), they are our partners as much as possible, so we try to find the right solutions. We understand this pressure on farmers last year. There is no ideal decision, but the decision to continue this ban is a tsenigri decision that may be, so we need to look for other options ... Prohibition will only be an increase in problems, because it will try to use Russian in their interests, To provoke a weakening of unity in Europe. It cannot be allowed. We will let us know as frankly as possible about each other, ”the Ukrainian official said.
As it was reported, the EU Council has just approved the continuation of the duty -free trade between the EU and Ukraine for another year, until June 2024. These regulatory rulers come into force on June 6 this year.
At the same time, the blockade of the Black Sea ports by the Russian Federation has led to a slim increase in the volume of transportation of Ukrainian grain and other farm goods with land, due to the "corridors of solidarity" on the border with neighboring countries, which significantly affected the domestic market of these countries and caused protests from local farmers.
On April 28, the European Commission agreed with the four neighboring countries of Ukraine - Bolgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - a package of measures that the avanged after the mentioned countries have abolished their sole actions of anti -agrarian imports from Ukraine. This package limits imports into the territory of the aforementioned countries, as well as Romania, four key products from Ukraine - wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, although it preserves the possibility of transit of goods to other EU countries and the world market.

“This once again shows how much success in the battlefield depends on the motivation of tanning training. Only a highly prepared staffing staff can conduct combined operations, based on all opportunities, including infantry, artillery and aviation support. We have seen how Russian commanders have fallen effectively to coordinate their prevailing in number. The professional, educated and trained officers' composition is what a military manner is called a true "enlightenment of power", - the European Diplomat emphasized.

According to a survey conducted by the Sociological Group "Rating", among mothers of Ukrainian children aged 3 to 16 years, 60% of Ukrainian children were witnesses or participants of certain events related to war.

· Psychological support;
· Training on the peculiarities of baby care and development;
· Selection, adaptation of special equipment and means of alternative communication for the child and training for their use.
