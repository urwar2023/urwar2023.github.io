Про це глава українського оборонного відомства[написав](https://twitter.com/oleksiireznikov/status/1662944820132708353)Utwitter.

“Throughout history, you have repeatedly argued that the Australians are a nation of freedoms who always oppose the bully. You are 15 thousand kilometers, but are close to our common values and willingness to protect them. Therefore, in the first month of the Russian aggression, Australia was the largest contributor of Ukraine, ”Alexei Reznikov said.

He added that Australian armored personnel carriers [Bushmaster](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/09/avstralijski-bushmaster-efektyvno-praczyuyut-na-bahmutskomu-napryamku/)are incredible in real -like operations. However, the Ukrainian struggle for global freedom is still unfinished, and Kiev still needs Australia support.

“I urge you to join the international" tank coalition "today. In addition to the tanks, we would be honored to get Australian armored vehicles. They could be invaluable for our troops during the contrast, ”said Alexei Reznikov.

Вона регулярно через месенджер повідомляла співробітнику силспеціальних операцій головного управління генерального штабу зс рф інформаціющодо результатів та місць ракетних ударів, завданих ворогом по населенихпунктах Донеччини.

Вона також передавала дані про місця дислокації, рух, кількість особовогоскладу та техніки ЗСУ для подальшого їх артилерійського обстрілу.

Обвинувачена усвідомлювала, що ця інформація буде використана ворогом дляподальшого проведення розвідувально-підривної діяльності на шкоду інтересам тадержавній безпеці України. За це агресор, у разі захоплення регіону,гарантував їй керівну посаду в окупаційній адміністрації.

У цій діяльності обвинуваченій допомагала подруга, теж жителька Краматорська,яка в силу своєї професійної діяльності володіла інформацією про місцядислокації ЗСУ.

“A stable world is impossible without a world order, which is based on respect for dottorial integrity and sovereignty. Also in order to interrupt cyclicals by [Russia](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia), it is necessary to bring the country's management responsible for the crime of aggression. No one is uninvited, ”said the head of the Estonian government.

She stressed at the meeting that the war unleashed by Russia should end with the impression of the aggressor. At the same time, the best factor in Russia's restraint is strong and membership in the Alliance. “Our region - there is a confirmation. In order to take care of gray zones in Europe, which are constantly serving a source of conflict, it is necessary that Ukraine joins NATO after the war. In Vilnius, Ukraine needs a positive signal in this direction, ”Kallas said.

According to her, real collective safety means that the contribution of all allies to their defense capability should increase to a level that allows the effective consumption of defense and restraint throughout the Alliance and the opposition of dangers. “In order to put into place agreed steps to strengthen and continue to support Ukraine, it is very important to carry out in Vilnius an agreement that the costs of all allies for defense will immediately grow up to 2% of GDP and continue to increase to 2.5% by 2030. Estonia has already decided to raise its investments in state defense to 3% of GDP, ”said Pryremier -Minister.

And we thought that it would be good in solidarity and support to name this small lane, located next to the Russian Embassy, which has no name now -to predict it to the Glory to Ukraine lane. Laantje in the Dutch means a lap, a small lane. So it was our main idea. We are a Hague city, but we are also the Netherlands citizens. And as you know, the Netherlands is actively supporting, let's call it the Anti -Putin Alliance. And they were aware that it could be a good gesture right now, after a visit to the Netherlands. We are proud of what they have done. I mean it is a sign of support for Ukraine and its people and, if you say, its armed forces. This is very important, ”said in a comment to Ukrinform Dutch Dzheims de Buh, one of the initiators of the action.“Hundreds of children go this little street every day, as there are many schools. They go bicycles and walk this lane to schools and sports sites. And we would like to be reminded of them every time, however, that they and we are privileged to live here, in the Netherlands, where there is no war, ”the activist said.

Two Ukrainian women were invited to the opening of the name "Glory of Ukraine".

“When there is a Glory of Ukraine Sign in Hague, it is a very large signs of solidarity, a sign of support. Of course, it would be best if the Russian police received a mail or ordered something to "Glory to Ukraine" - a Tsebul would be perfect, but this is the next step, "Bun said.

In her turn, the Ukrainian Olga King, who was in Ukraine in Ukraine in Ukraine, said that for Ukrainians who were forced to leave their own homes, the Glory of Ukraine is a small victory.

“I think I will now say from tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are now in the Netherlands because of the war, that it is a small victory. Seeing Russian Glory to Ukraine is a sense of filling and inspiration. Mandicity with gratitude to the Dutch community that supports us. It is necessary for "Glory to Ukraine" to sound everywhere with the words "We won", -the king added in a comment to Ukrinform.

This opinion was expressed by the Russian opposition politician Harry Kasparov in [interviewed](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3715981-garri-kasparov-rosijskij-opozicijnij-politik-zasnovnik-forumu-vilnoi-rosii.html).

He noted that the PRC has ancient territorial claims to Russia, so the Bezakin in the light of the defeat of Russia in Ukraine opens "much interesting perpetrator".

“As for me, [China](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj)He plays a game that brings with him a historical perspective. Of course, in the initial stage, the mitigates would be interested in the victory of Putin, as it would open the way to Dalavan, and would be the defeat of the event and the success of the forces of totalitarianism and tyranny.(China leader - ed.)We have been aware that Russia did not win the war, and any other result opens other opportunities before, ”Kasparov said.

According to the chess world exchmpion, China is interested in the conflict today, as it weakens both Russia and the West.

According to him, China is the only country that has territorial printing in Russia, based on treaties of the XVII and XIX centuries.

“Chinese historiography has always argued that the Russian Empire has selected 1.5 million km km in the territory, which in area as two and a half of Ukraine - cetering from Vladivostok to Baikal. Unlike Putin's fantasies pro -Ukraine, these are real maps, contracts signed between China and Russian kingdom in 1689(Nerchinsky Treaty - Ed.)and later - in 1860(Beijing Treaty - Ed.)”, - Kasparov emphasized.

He added that from the point of view of Xi Jinping, perhaps the collapse of Russia in a protracted war "opens the way to much more interesting prospects than the war for Taiwan."

Concerning the issues of peacekeeping efforts of others in the Russian-friendly Ukrainians-Hungary and Brazil-Kasparov expressed the opinion that in the first case there would be corruption, and in the second-anti-Americanism, which is common in the countries of the called global south.

The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine Mykola Solsky stated this in Brussels in Brussels during the communication with the press in the results of the non -formal working lunch within the EU Council of Ministers for Agricultural Economy and Fisheries.

“Today we had a meeting with many ministers and representatives [European Commission](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrokomisia). We have outlined the prohibition of import of Ukrainian agricultural products after June 5. We are against it, this is not a good way, ”the Ukrainian government officer said.

“We are very grateful to our Turkish partners and united nations, as well as to all partners for the opportunity to continue this corridor for another few months. At the same time, we understand that the Russians carefully monitor the situation, they try to take advantage of it. We do not want to give them can use this, ”Solsky said.

Answering the question of Ukrinform correspondent, the Minister explained that there will be no existing restrictions on Ukrainian agrarian imports until at least 5th, and this will not be a good idea to continue them in the future. This applies to the first place, such crops as sunflower seeds, corn, wheat and rapeseed. The Minister recalled that Ukraine actively traded rapeseed seeds with EU seed . At the same time, Solsky emphasized that the Ukrainian side is as interested in finding a constructive solution.“Countries that have introduced these restrictions(Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria Irumunia - ed.), they are our partners as much as possible, so we try to find the right solutions. We understand this pressure on farmers last year. There is no ideal decision, but the decision to continue this ban is a tsenigri decision that may be, so we need to look for other options ... Prohibition will only be an increase in problems, because it will try to use Russian in their interests, To provoke a weakening of unity in Europe. It cannot be allowed. We will let us know as frankly as possible about each other, ”the Ukrainian official said.

As it was reported, the EU Council has just approved the continuation of the duty -free trade between the EU and Ukraine for another year, until June 2024. These regulatory rulers come into force on June 6 this year.

At the same time, the blockade of the Black Sea ports by the Russian Federation has led to a slim increase in the volume of transportation of Ukrainian grain and other farm goods with land, due to the "corridors of solidarity" on the border with neighboring countries, which significantly affected the domestic market of these countries and caused protests from local farmers.

On April 28, the European Commission agreed with the four neighboring countries of Ukraine - Bolgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - a package of measures that the avanged after the mentioned countries have abolished their sole actions of anti -agrarian imports from Ukraine. This package limits imports into the territory of the aforementioned countries, as well as Romania, four key products from Ukraine - wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, although it preserves the possibility of transit of goods to other EU countries and the world market.

Through United24, charitable contributions from all over the world immediately get to Ukraine, and this is the most important. For me, the beambasador is, above all, responsibility and pride. And also daily work. During this year, I visited several dozen countries and met a thousand people. They all have different positions: someone supports Ukraine openly taply, someone makes donations anonymously, someone only reflects on their first contribution and public position. My task is to make all the heels with our country and stay with it for victory and many and many many years after, ”Andrey Shevchenko stressed.

“At the beginning of the United24, we sent more than a thousand letters to potential ambasadors. However, they received only a few answers - and they are all bewildered. After all, the USBasador United24 is not a one -time post on social networks, apostular work, personal responsibility for meetings, communication with the press, a large number of events. Shevchenko became the first to answer "yes". He drew the gates of Ambassadorism, and followed by Imagine Dragons, Balenciaga, Mark Hemill and other people who support Ukraine daily in the way of victory.

“Of course, Ukraine is not relevant. We do not need to do this, we have enough important tasks for drawing large -scale blows, using scarce weapons, including rockets and drones, in the occupation. Secondly, we are much more concerned about the blows that Russian -bearing in our capital, ”he said.

“I will remind you that on May 9 were(Accepted - ed.)Some decisions to ban the use of drones, drones in the Central Federal District.

On this [emphasized](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/lessons-war-ukraine-future-eu-defence_en)The high representative of the EU on Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrel.

“With the invasion of Russia into Ukraine, the usual high -intensity land war came to our borders. We have not seen the war between the nations of such intenability for decades in Europe. And this war continues much more than someone could expect, including Putin. The European Union supports Ukraine in confrontation between Russia's aggression, but Europeans also have to understand the fundamentally changed landscape of security and new threats with which we are coating, and draw the right conclusions about the military resources we needed, ”said Josep Borrel.

He noted that one of the greatest lessons that the EU can take out of the war is the wonderful ability of the Ukrainian army to successfully adapt, opposing one of the largest armies in the world.

“This once again shows how much success in the battlefield depends on the motivation of tanning training. Only a highly prepared staffing staff can conduct combined operations, based on all opportunities, including infantry, artillery and aviation support. We have seen how Russian commanders have fallen effectively to coordinate their prevailing in number. The professional, educated and trained officers' composition is what a military manner is called a true "enlightenment of power", - the European Diplomat emphasized.

Josep Borrel noted the high innovativeness and success of Ukrainian in command and management.

“Every day it is becoming more understandable how successfully Ukraine is using the highlardioelectronic struggle to deteriorate radio signals and radars of enemy failure of drones and missiles. Electronic struggle, including a cyber sector, but not limited to it, are becoming more relevant, ”said Josep Borrel.

According to a survey conducted by the Sociological Group "Rating", among mothers of Ukrainian children aged 3 to 16 years, 60% of Ukrainian children were witnesses or participants of certain events related to war.

The large-scale invasion of Russia also had a negative impact on the health of the baby's parents who were born in the days of the Russian-Ukrainian war.

Stress, malnutrition, dehydration, stay in harmful conditions, such as such or cellars - all this often has a negative impact on the course. As a result, some children are born prematurely and/or confident diseases.

- "Medical rehabilitation of infants who were born prematurely and/or sick during the first three years of life";

- "Rehabilitation assistance to adults and children in hospital";

- "Rehabilitation assistance to adults and children in outpatient conditions".

Since the beginning of the year, more than 14 thousand Ukrainian children have passed such rehabilitation. More than 2.5 thousand of them - under the package "Medical rehabilitation of infants, have been prematurely and/or patients, during the first three years of life."

As part of this package, assistance is provided not only for babies. Parents or children of children under the age of three can also receive a number of services free of charge, including:

· Psychological support;

· Training on the peculiarities of baby care and development;

· Selection, adaptation of special equipment and means of alternative communication for the child and training for their use.

To get children rehabilitation services, parents are enough to have:

· Refusion of the primary care physician with whom the declaration is concluded;

· Direction from a treating doctor;

· Direction to transfer from another medical institution or a hospital unit.

For children ** older than three years ** a prerequisite for providing such a service with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team of a pediatrician is a compulsory service._ Prepared Lesia Medvedenko_

The relevant statement was made on Tuesday by the US permanent representative at Ooninda Thomas Greenfield, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“According to recent reports, Moscow has disconnected vital sensors of radiation monitoring in Zaporozhye, which means that data from the station are now being sent to the Russian nuclear regulator. It is a clear escalation of RFFDUDivation of Ukrainian sovereignty and control over the Zaporizhzhya NPP, ”the USA said.

She noted that it undermines the UN confidence in nuclear security at the station.

“I will say clearly, ** [Zaporizhzhya NPP](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zaporizka-aes)** It belongs to Ukraine, so its data should be flowing to Ukraine, not to Russia, ”Thomas Grinfield emphasized.

She called the actions of the Russian Federation "reckless" and stated that they contrast sharply by the relevant behavior of Ukraine.

“During this conflict, CEO(IAEA - ed.)Grossi is clearly understood that Ukraine has fully interacted in the process of implementation of all nuclear facilities, and that the IAEA has found no signs of concern related to nuclear spread in Ukraine, ”the US representative reminded.

As reported by Ukrinform, a meeting of the UN Security Council on the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was held on Tuesday. The participants of the meeting were studied by the director of MAEA Rafael Grosssey, who formulated five principles of nuclear safety to guarantee nuclear security at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-31T00-23-00-03-00/630_360_1645674654-338.jpg)The United States stated that the Russian side of radiation monitoring at the Zaporizhzhya NPP is an escalation by Moscow, directed by Ukraine, and that it threatens nuclear security throughout the region.

The relevant statement was made on Tuesday by the US permanent representative at Ooninda Thomas Greenfield, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“According to recent reports, Moscow has disconnected vital sensors of radiation monitoring in Zaporozhye, which means that data from the station are now being sent to the Russian nuclear regulator. It is a clear escalation of RFFDUDivation of Ukrainian sovereignty and control over the Zaporizhzhya NPP, ”the USA said.

She noted that it undermines the UN confidence in nuclear security at the station.

“I will say clearly, ** [Zaporizhzhya NPP](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zaporizka-aes)** It belongs to Ukraine, so its data should be flowing to Ukraine, not to Russia, ”Thomas Grinfield emphasized.

She called the actions of the Russian Federation "reckless" and stated that they contrast sharply by the relevant behavior of Ukraine.

“During this conflict, CEO(IAEA - ed.)Grossi is clearly understood that Ukraine has fully interacted in the process of implementation of all nuclear facilities, and that the IAEA has found no signs of concern related to nuclear spread in Ukraine, ”the US representative reminded.

According to her, there is no doubt that "Russia's actions are an attack on a safety and the world, so we must unite and demand that the president Putinify this madness."

As reported by Ukrinform, a meeting of the UN Security Council on the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was held on Tuesday. The participants of the meeting were studied by the director of MAEA Rafael Grosssey, who formulated five principles of nuclear safety to guarantee nuclear security at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.
