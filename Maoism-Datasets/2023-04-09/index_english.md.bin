As a result of investigative operations, the organizer of the enemy "cell" was detained. He was a displaced person from Zaporozhye, who moved to the Nakirovograd region after the beginning of a full -scale invasion.

There he began to create massively anonymous accounts on social networks and seated through Darknet. The corresponding equipment was installed in the rented apartment from the sleeping areas of the regional center

The average cost of one bot is 200 UAH.

It is established that the attacker created almost 3 thousand fake accounts, which he planned to sell for a total amount of more than half a million UAH.

Its main "clients" were representatives of the Russian special services, as well as their control of pro -Kremlin propagandists.

Bots needed aggressors to "accelerate" misinformation allegedly on behalf of Ukrainian citizens about the situation at the front, as well as for trying to discredit the units of the Defense Forces.

Thus, the enemy tried to shake the intra-political situation of the inserted regions of Ukraine in the conditions of war.

About it reports [](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/07/politics/pentagon-leaked-ukraine-documents/index.html), reports Ukrinform.

As it is noted, the investigation began after on Friday, there were no documents that cover a wide range of issues: from supporting Ukraine's United States to information about US key allies, such as Israel, which increased the number of consequences of the already alarming leakage of information.

On Thursday [ ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-pentagon)He stated that he was studying the collection after reporting on the social networks there were obviously classified documents about the war in Ukraine.

"They look genuine," said the American official in an interview with CNNN of documents.

US officials say they are serious about leakage, as they are investigating and working on a more formal assessment of what is contained and how they have leaked into open access.

They, apparently, contain secret information on various topics - from the operations of mercenaries of the Vagner Group in Africa and the ways of providing Israel to lethal assistance to Ukraine with reconnaissance information about the UAE with Russia and the concern of South Koreyshche to provide ammunition for use in Ukraine.

CNN was unable to check independently that the documents were not changed. Alena depicts that they are similar to a number of secret documents about Ukraine, which have been cyclined on the Internet over the last weeks, and which American officials have confirmed CNN on Friday morning that they are authentic.

As in the case of these documents, Friday finds were also photographs of the printed and crumpled documents. They all had a secrecy stamp, some of them were "secret", that is, the highest level of classroom. They were also made from mid -February to early March.It is unclear who is behind the origins and where they came from.

As writes [](https://www.reuters.com/world/south-korea-discuss-issues-raised-leaked-documents-with-us-2023-04-09/), in South Korea, they know the leakage of several secret military documents. According to the representative of South Korea President, Seoul plans to discuss Zvashington "problems that have arisen as a result of the leakage of information."

As reported by Ukrinform, the New York Times published a material in which [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3693170-u-ssa-viavili-novij-vitik-sekretnih-dokumentiv-pro-vijskovi-plani-ukraini-zmi.html)that concerns the US and NATO plans for the Armed Forces.

Suns will meet [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bajden)On Tuesday, April 11, in the evening, when his plane Air Force One lands, which will be closely tracked on both sides of the Irish border during increased political uncertainty in Northern Ireland.

On Wednesday, April 12, the Britain's Prime Minister is a solemn dinner in honor.

Biden, who often proudly speaks of his Irish roots, will also take time in the Irish Republic where Dublin will visit.

Good Friday Agreement, signed on April 10, 1998, has significantly stopped three decades of bloodshed, which has been shocked by the region since the late 1960s.

However, the anniversary was overshadowed by the annual boycott of the largest siritanist Party of Northern Ireland, a decentralized government of distribution, which is the central element of the peace agreement. The Democratic Union Party is angered by the Brexit trade rules that put a northern Ireland in a different position than the rest of the UK.

In March, the British Intelligence Service Mi5 announced an increase in the level of demand in Northern Ireland to "serious", which indicates the high probability of attacks, although this step was not related to the anniversary.

About it [reports](https://t.me/energoatom_ua/12661)State enterprise "National Atomic Energy Generating Company" Energoatom ".

"From now on, the employees of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station will not reach the Donesa, as it was always, and part of the way will walk on foot," - said the news.

It is noted that the buses for the staff of the ZPEC, who are delivering to work, will no longer run to the final point of the route. A new fence will become a new fence, which the invaders will be equipped on the approaches of the station -building of the station. To do this, they have already started digging the ground.

Anyone can try themselves as a drone operator simply in the action "Action". The goal is to destroy the enemy columns of tanks. In addition, everyone can do the real "army of drones" in order to strengthen our military and save the life of more people.

About it [reports](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/keruite-virtualnymy-bezpilotnykamy-ta-donatte-na-zsu-u-dii-ziavylasia-hra-armiia-droniv)Ministry of digital transformation of Ukraine.

It is noted that the ministry team worked on a new game for Ukrainians with Ilogos.

"At the beginning of a full -scale war, users of" Action "could lift a moral motion, playing" Baracar "in" Action ". Now it's time to manage drones. Functionality was refined and most importantly - they added the opportunity to make it without a grace. So, while you are destroying hostile equipment virtually, thanks to your Donatamash, the military can, together with the "Army of Drones," destroy the enemy on a real polyb ", - the message reads.

The main task of the participant of the game in "Actions" is to prevent Russian tanks to pass roadblocks. To do this, you manage the drone as an operator, directs it to hostile equipment and throw away the projectile. Complete combat missions, accumulate points and open new birds. Everything is as realistic as possible.

“There is another interesting feature in the game. Almost every enemy tank is carrying a wash washing machine. Therefore, in the game, Russian invaders appear real-toilet terrorists.

Play and finish!” - the press service of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine wrote.

Meanwhile, the United States is also experimenting with land work - Pentagon announces a new competition for the creation of prototypes of robotic machine -class. New drones of terrestrial combat vehicles are likely to be formed on the basis of the already existing RCV-L platform(Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light), and the total amount for design works is 142 million.

A spokesman for the Eastern Grouping of Ukraine Colonel Sergey Cherevaty informed about it in the direct Eviritetleorphone "Unified News".

- Previous efforts of the enemy to take all routes for Bakhmut under fire, intermediary control have shown that we find effective exits from such situations and provide supply to the defenders of the city of ammunition, ammunition, products and everything necessary. At the same time, we evacuate our wounded, - said the spokesman.

The officer said that in the areas where the enemy concentrates his blows, the invaders have a significant advantage in artillery. These are usually Soviet -circles, but they still have enough ammunition. In order to continue to ferment our positions, in the available losses in personnel, the opponent acts artillery and rocket fire.

- If you take the Bakhmut direction where the enemy focused on the main blow, they have not been able to achieve systemic successes here. The content of the most aggressive terrorist group "Wagner" operates, - said the colonel Sergey Cherevaty.

- The battle in the city is one of the most complex types of combat. The fact that there are southeasters or other regular units there are not the reinforcement of the Wagnerians, the accompanying the large losses of this group. At the same time, the units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are also completed with mobilized Russians without the appropriate level of preparation of tamotivation. These are the forced steps of the invaders, because they lose their lives here every day, ”the spokesman added.

Sergei Cherevaty also noted that the Liman direction is the second concern after Bakhmutsky in the area of their responsibility. In particular, the plug -in days there were 202 shelling of barrel and jet artillery, seven combat clashes. 50 invaders in this direction were destroyed, 86 - it was sold.

The most effective method of combating managed aircraft is to direct the activities of Russian aviation, the opportunity to drive it away from the distinctive territories. This requires appropriate tools, such as Patrotta SAMP/T systems with a distance of air targets up to 150 kilometers. And best of all, these are modern Western fighters armed with air-air missiles capable of counteracting Russian aviation at great distances. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, reported this during a direct ether of the Television News.

- It is clear that a bomb, which is dropped from a plane from a high height and plans for nineering, can also be beaten. But the enemy applies about 20 -kept airbombs every day, where to take so many airfare products for their removal? Their reserves are not endless. If you use authentic rockets in these bombs, there is a threat that we simply do not have the weapons for pro -trial Russian aviation in the country, - said Yuri Ignat.

The officer emphasized that the main task of the Air Force is to prevent the appearance of Russian aircraft and helicopters in the Ukrainian sky. If this is allowed, they will be able to do much more harm than from a distance. As examples, the events of the events in Mariupol and Izium region, where Russian aviation could work without interruption.

- So we say that we need more air defense means to protect both ourselves and our partners. It is also about the systems that we promise-NASAMS, Iris-T, as well as Patriot and SAMP/T, which in the near future have to go to Ukraine in the near future. But still modern aircraft 4+, the same F-16 is what will allow us to win the advantage in the air, extremely effectively protect the enemy and finally win,-said the Switch of the Armed Forces Command.

The spokesman said that we have fighters of Soviet samples, unfortunately, are not effective in destroying rockets and drones, because they were created for anti -hostilizers. Today, they also perform the tasks of covering shock groups and storms that support our troops in the east of the country use the radiolocation missiles HARM, which have been able to adapt pre -Soviet technology. It is timely and impossible to resist these Russian aircraft with Russian aircraft.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-09T93-00-00-04-00/golovna-7-1.jpg)The Erefia Ministry of Defense developed techniques for combating tanks of Western production, which are armed with the Armed Forces, in particular from Leopard. About it [reported](https://t.me/bbcrussian/44448)Russian service BBC News, with a statement to the head of the Mulinoa Eugenearifulin Mulino Center on the Air of the Propaganda TV channel "Star".

According to him, Mulino has already been preparing crews of tanks "directly for tank duels" with Western panzers. Well, to the Armed Forces tank duels, our tankers in this case sometimes simply make miracles, even the names of the Soviet times. But what is truly interesting in the statement of aniki-warrior, so that to combat western tanks at the landfill is also trained ... snipers and machine gunners!

“A good machine gunner, a good sniper will deprive the vision tank, and agran launchers will shoot him. New is a well -forgotten old one. Our grandparents did in the warrior, ”the Russian Defense Ministry is announced ...

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-09T93-00-00-04-00/foto-2-1-1.jpg)Imagine the level of military knowledge of the whole chief of the training center? At least on the Internet, I have tried to find out that the eyes have those wraps and whether they are vulnerable to the ball. About the level of armored protection a little reading, fire power, roundabout, accuracy and more.

And about the historical knowledge of the soldiers and to speak. Because the first grenade launchers(Panzertfaast Ta Faustpatron)During the Second World War were only in the Nazis. Araji soldiers destroyed German tanks at best with a 45 mm anti -tankovica. But in the melee - the connections of pins from trenches, and rarely - with the help of anti -tank rifles of PTRS and PTRD of a caliber 14.5 mm, which were able to punch the armor up to 30 mm thick. They were still able to damage the tank in its most vulnerable places, but destroy ...

Apparently, this "specialist" would not surprise us if he also referred to the evil-cavalry cavalry who went to the tanks with checkers with checkers to emphasize the infantry.

Such conclusions of a waperative analysis [came](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-8-2023)American Institute for War Study(Isw).

Зокрема, аналітики констатують, що темпи наступу в Бахмуті Донецької областіта ще на кількох ділянках фронту суттєво знизилися, а на деяких напрямкахфронт взагалі зупинився. Як захлинувся наступ і на Авдіївку Донецької області,яку росіяни обрали собі за нову мету замість Бахмута.

Також, йдеться в аналізі, російська армія без успіху намагається взяти підконтроль Мар'їнку Донецької області, хоча місто вже фактично знищене. У ISWдодають, що динаміка застосування артилерії на полі бою в Україні відбиває тойфакт, що російські війська використовують артилерію для компенсації своїхнедостатніх наступальних спроможностей.
