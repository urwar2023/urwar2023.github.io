It is noted that the buses for the staff of the ZPEC, who are delivering to work, will no longer run to the final point of the route. A new fence will become a new fence, which the invaders will be equipped on the approaches of the station -building of the station. To do this, they have already started digging the ground.
Therefore, route buses only reach the ring where workers are squeezed, and they should just go. Thus, the racists actually expand the closed perimeter around the station, as if preparing it for defense. More speaking: they are afraid that they do not stop even before illegal building in the territory of the atomic object.
“ZPP is Ukraine!And no fences will prevent the return of the station under the contractor and the legal operator - energy apparatus!” - added to the press service.

 The United Kingdom conducted a test of three different heavy -traffic unmanned vehicles(H-UGV). Ці сухопутні безпілотники важать понад п’ятьтонн. Під час випробувань оцінювалися параметри швидкості машин, а такожможливості системи зв’язку при керуванні ними у складних умовах рельєфумісцевості. Зважаючи на масу цих машин, на них можна встановлювати різні типиозброєння — варіанти вогневої потужності передбачають автоматичні гарматикалібру від 25 до 50 мм. На думку експертів, випробування дозволяють детальнооцінити не лише наявні тактико-технічні характеристики, а й зробити висновкипро подальші перспективи бойового використання та потенціалу на полі боюбезпілотних транспортних засобів протягом наступних десятиліть.
 The interest of the British defense department in modern terrestrial non -spy systems can be traced to the example of a new sample of a landmetrone from Rheinmetall. The company's engineers have presented the Wiesel Wingman Avtonic Autonomous Terrestrial Machine, which was designed as a fully -digked version of Wiesel combat armored vehicle, integrated with tinnitative capabilities and can be equipped with a general remote removal and a Javelin missile launch station. As you know, the UK Ministry of Defense has a contract with Rheinmetall Bae Systems Land(RBSL)There are 148 major Challenger 2 main combat tanks to the New Standard of Challenger 3 worth almost $ 968 million.
Meanwhile, the United States is also experimenting with land work - Pentagon announces a new competition for the creation of prototypes of robotic machine -class. New drones of terrestrial combat vehicles are likely to be formed on the basis of the already existing RCV-L platform(Robotic Combat Vehicle-Light), and the total amount for design works is 142 million. But the requirements for tactical and technical characteristics and systemarrows put forward by the US Defense Ministry to a new combat ground, it is still unknown.

 Our engineers, our logists do everything they need to overcome the consequences of the bridge between Bakhmut and the village of Chrome. A spokesman for the Eastern Grouping of Ukraine Colonel Sergey Cherevaty informed about it in the direct Eviritetleorphone "Unified News".
The officer said that in the areas where the enemy concentrates his blows, the invaders have a significant advantage in artillery. These are usually Soviet -circles, but they still have enough ammunition. In order to continue to ferment our positions, in the available losses in personnel, the opponent acts artillery and rocket fire.
If you take the Bakhmut direction where the enemy focused on the main blow, they have not been able to achieve systemic successes here. The content of the most aggressive terrorist group "Wagner" operates, - said the colonel Sergey Cherevaty.
The battle in the city is one of the most complex types of combat. The fact that there are southeasters or other regular units there are not the reinforcement of the Wagnerians, the accompanying the large losses of this group. At the same time, the units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are also completed with mobilized Russians without the appropriate level of preparation of tamotivation. These are the forced steps of the invaders, because they lose their lives here every day, ”the spokesman added.
Sergei Cherevaty also noted that the Liman direction is the second concern after Bakhmutsky in the area of their responsibility. In particular, the plug -in days there were 202 shelling of barrel and jet artillery, seven combat clashes. 50 invaders in this direction were destroyed, 86 - it was sold.

The most effective method of combating managed aircraft is to direct the activities of Russian aviation, the opportunity to drive it away from the distinctive territories. This requires appropriate tools, such as Patrotta SAMP/T systems with a distance of air targets up to 150 kilometers. And best of all, these are modern Western fighters armed with air-air missiles capable of counteracting Russian aviation at great distances. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, reported this during a direct ether of the Television News.
The officer emphasized that the main task of the Air Force is to prevent the appearance of Russian aircraft and helicopters in the Ukrainian sky. If this is allowed, they will be able to do much more harm than from a distance. As examples, the events of the events in Mariupol and Izium region, where Russian aviation could work without interruption.
The spokesman said that we have fighters of Soviet samples, unfortunately, are not effective in destroying rockets and drones, because they were created for anti -hostilizers. Today, they also perform the tasks of covering shock groups and storms that support our troops in the east of the country use the radiolocation missiles HARM, which have been able to adapt pre -Soviet technology. It is timely and impossible to resist these Russian aircraft with Russian aircraft.

 The Erefia Ministry of Defense developed techniques for combating tanks of Western production, which are armed with the Armed Forces, in particular from Leopard. About it reported Russian service BBC News, with a statement to the head of the Mulinoa Eugenearifulin Mulino Center on the Air of the Propaganda TV channel "Star".
According to him, Mulino has already been preparing crews of tanks "directly for tank duels" with Western panzers. Well, to the Armed Forces tank duels, our tankers in this case sometimes simply make miracles, even the names of the Soviet times. But what is truly interesting in the statement of aniki-warrior, so that to combat western tanks at the landfill is also trained ... snipers and machine gunners!
“A good machine gunner, a good sniper will deprive the vision tank, and agran launchers will shoot him. New is a well -forgotten old one. Our grandparents did in the warrior, ”the Russian Defense Ministry is announced ...
 Imagine the level of military knowledge of the whole chief of the training center? At least on the Internet, I have tried to find out that the eyes have those wraps and whether they are vulnerable to the ball. About the level of armored protection a little reading, fire power, roundabout, accuracy and more.
And about the historical knowledge of the soldiers and to speak. Because the first grenade launchers(Panzertfaast Ta Faustpatron)During the Second World War were only in the Nazis. Araji soldiers destroyed German tanks at best with a 45 mm anti -tankovica. But in the melee - the connections of pins from trenches, and rarely - with the help of anti -tank rifles of PTRS and PTRD of a caliber 14.5 mm, which were able to punch the armor up to 30 mm thick. They were still able to damage the tank in its most vulnerable places, but destroy ...
Apparently, this "specialist" would not surprise us if he also referred to the evil-cavalry cavalry who went to the tanks with checkers with checkers to emphasize the infantry.

 Despite the continuation of the battles along the entire front line, the offensive potential of the Russian army decreased, its offensive fades. Such conclusions of a waperative analysis came American Institute for War Study(Isw).
Зокрема, аналітики констатують, що темпи наступу в Бахмуті Донецької областіта ще на кількох ділянках фронту суттєво знизилися, а на деяких напрямкахфронт взагалі зупинився. Як захлинувся наступ і на Авдіївку Донецької області,яку росіяни обрали собі за нову мету замість Бахмута.
Також, йдеться в аналізі, російська армія без успіху намагається взяти підконтроль Мар'їнку Донецької області, хоча місто вже фактично знищене. У ISWдодають, що динаміка застосування артилерії на полі бою в Україні відбиває тойфакт, що російські війська використовують артилерію для компенсації своїхнедостатніх наступальних спроможностей.
