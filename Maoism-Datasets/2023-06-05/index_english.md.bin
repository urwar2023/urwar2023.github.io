This decision has been announced on Monday by the EU, given the complaint of the April 2021 on Polish judicial reform since 2019, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

During the reading of the sentence in court, it is emphasized, in particular, that the Earlier Chamber of the Supreme Court [Poland] was created(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-polsa)“Does not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality.” As prescribed, the "broad and inaccurate nature" of individual provisions allows you to use the disciplinary responsibility of judges for their substantiated punishment.

It is emphasized that certain provisions of the judicial reform of the RP "incompatible with the guarantee of the report to the independent and impartial court".

On the day of announcement of the sentence, the European Commission has suspended a definition of a daily fine for Poland, but emphasized the need for Warsawaza to pay the financial punishment, which is the highest in EU history - about 550 mlneurov. These funds are automatically deducted by the European Commission from European Funds for Polish.

The decision of the EU Court is final and cannot be challenged. The court determined that the Polish should change the legislation in order to meet the European standards. Therefore, the European Commission gives time for Warsaw to change the legislation of the US. If Poland fails to enforce the decision of the EU Court, the Toevro Commission may initiate another case against Poland and in the case of a win by Poland may be a financial punishment again.

The first - I am grateful to every warrior, all our defenders and defenders who gave for this day the news we expect. Bakhmut direction - youth, warriors!

We see how hysterically Russia perceives any of our step there, all our positions.

The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to the shocks, warriors, and in particular in the Donetsk region. Thank you for it!

Today I would like to point out some of our combat units. It is a 5-story storm brigade and a 57th separate infantry brigade, who are skillfully protecting our positions, destroying the occupiers and, most importantly, move forward.

Thank you, warriors!Thank you all!

Second, we continue our work on sanctions against Russia.

Although the global trend is already understood - Russia is losing this war, businessmen continue to deny reality. They continue to try to deceive, to bypass sanctions, to produce more weapons, to provide greater waste of people's resources for this aggression.

We are preparing our steps, new steps for even greater limitation of Russian -military potential. Everyone in the world who helps the terrorist state to circumstance sanctions, everyone in the world whom Russia uses for the supply of weapons, components, equipment-every such entity must feel the full power of the free world.

And we will provide it.

This is a common task in the world - to stop terror. And the main prerequisite for this task is to stop any paths that terrorists still try to keep something for themselves.

News - soon.

Third. Today he held a long and very meaningful meeting on the transformation of a country, our lives - now and after victory.

Objectively, there are fundamental security, economic, energy, technological and simply human issues that require complete and effective answers.A strong state, a free state, a modern state, a pleasant state.

We lay the basis for this. All who are fighting for the sake of Ukraine. All who work for the sake of Ukraine. Everyone who helps.

For example, today in the format, the government, office, NSDC discussed the energy industry in a broad sense - agricultural production. Not only the restoration of what Ukraine was, but the development and expansion, taking into account the global role of Ukraine in order to food and energy security of Europe and the world.

We will present all these details. Will be thorough. In particular, we will present at the London Medical Conference on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which will take place this month.

And, of course, we do not stop our international work with partners a day.

There was a Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom today in Kyiv. Good, useful negotiations and new strengthening of our countries, our safety.

I thanked for all the defense support provided to Ukraine, and especially for the Storm Shedou missiles, which have shown themselves extremely effective in the forefront. I have been talking about a new coalition for the protection of life - Petriots.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom and NATO's training in Vilnius were spoken with Mr. The summit should be meaningful. Then it will become a tstorical.

Thank you all who help Ukraine!Thank you to everyone who brings the defeat's terror closer!

This opinion was expressed by the former Foreign Minister, the head of the Russian Central Committee Vladimir Ogrizko in an interview ["Radio NV"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tahblvfB5I&ab_channel=RadioNV), reports Ukrinform.

“I think his(Silence of the Russian leadership. - Ed.)It is necessary to interpret that the Russian system begins to lose the ability to govern. That is, this pre -infarction condition, which usually ends in the best case intense therapy, and at worst - fatal outcome, ”said [Ogryzko](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ogrizko).

He added that "intense therapy" implies "something that changes the goal of the game and gives the body the chances of some continuation of existence", and the "death result" is when "everything falls apart and flies under three devils."

According to him, there are many things that testify that the system of Russian authorization is its former "slimness", and in a country such as Russia means that it is really a step towards internal parsing.

“They can be called differently-riots, revolutions, etc. But there is a steady sensation that they come to the pre -infarction finishing line, ” - said Dylato.

Commenting on the reasons for the silence of the Russian authorities about hostilities acquired, Ogryzko suggested that the Russian leadership did not really know what to do in this. He noted that in such a situation, any adequate leader makes decisions, but in Russia they avoid it, because it means to remove the Zarront forces and thus weaken their positions.

“This is the case where there is no right decision when any proceeding is worsening the previous one. Because of this, this misunderstanding, and what, "Great and wise commander" to do today, because there is nothing to criticize the Diria borders, which everyone thought that they were 100 % protected, "the excendant said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-05T17-59-39-03-00/630_360_1645554853-487.jpg)Numerous "peaceful initiatives" of various politicians or religious figures are evidenced by a desperate attempt of the Kremlin to push the world public to press Kiev for the beginning of negotiations.

This opinion was expressed by the former Foreign Minister, the head of the Russian Central Committee Vladimir Ogrizko in an interview [Radio NV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tahblvfB5I&ab_channel=RadioNV), reports Ukrinform.

"Visits to China's special representatives or the Vatican, or these all the so -called civilian -initiatives of African countries or until recently, Brazil, actually speak only to the last, it seems to me that the Kremlin's desperate attempt to change something and somehow pushed the world public to Kiev," Sugrizko said.

He called such peaceful initiatives "political delights, which has no perspective" and noted that the answer to this both Ukraine and the West is known.

“Therefore, I think we need to look at it calmly and understand that [Kremlin](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kreml)He pulls out of the sleeve almost the last political card she still wants to play, but she is beaten. Here we, I think, cannot be of doubt that nothing real stands behind it, ” - said Dymplode.

In this context, the former Foreign Minister noted that the negotiations, which are mentioned in the event, are different - between equal partners or about signing the surrender.

Export revenue at this position has set $ 1.22 million, which is 19.27% more than the previous month. The main buyer of Ukrainian milk and cream was Moldova, where Ukrainian enterprises were shipped 93.2% of exports.

Exports of dry and condensed milk in May increased to 2.49 thousand tons(39.23%more than in April). Виручка від експорту цього виду продукції зросла до6,03 млн дол. (+35,69%). Близько 62% експорту сухого і згущеного молока буловідправлено в напрямку ЄС.

The amount of case and casein exports last month amounted to 476 tons worth $ 3.2 million. Natural exports of goods decreased by 23%, and reached by -39.54%. Processors reduce the production of technical codinin in the conditions of reduction of prices for goods.

AVM analyst Georgy Kukhaleyshvili suggests that the probable reason for increasing the total exports of Ukrainian dairy products in May is the dissemination of the governments of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgarian prohibition of the introduction of agro -industrial products from Ukraine.

Most dairy products imported into the EU from Ukraine are subsequently placed in the markets of third countries through the Black Sea or Danube Porticarumunia or Baltic ports of Poland. Demand for dairy products in the market is persons, and Ukrainian products are not interesting to local consumers. In the warehouse of European countries, so many stock products have accumulated that they cover the domestic market. It is likely that an increase in the export of butter from Ukraine restrains too much supply for this product in Europe. The best European cheeses and butter are attractive to clients in foreign market and they create competition for Ukrainian exporters.

In May, Ukraine reduced the volume of dairy products to 4,97 thousand.(-4,2%). Скорочення відбулося переважно за рахунок зменшення поставок вУкраїну молока і вершків тривалого зберігання, сирів, згущеного молока зєвропейських країн.

Україна у травні не імпортувала казеїн та казеїнати. Однак європейські країнизбільшили поставки в Україну вершкового масла до 74 т (+25,19%), dairy products - up to 829 tons(+11,37%)and whey - up to 567 tons(+7,14%).

This was reported in an interview with [Ukrainian radio](http://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101587)The European Commissioner for Internal Affairs Ilva Johansson reports.

In addition to these 450 thousand, some of the Ukrainian students are now in Europe, studying online with Ukrainian teachers, she said.

“There are now about 450 thousand children now go to European schools. However, there are also such ideas that teachers from Ukraine are taught online. And this is a kind of challenge, mush, because children not only need education - they need school socialization, communication with classmates, games on school grounds and other similar ones. Therefore, I think it is not necessary to focus on online learning for a long time, ”Johansson said.

According to her, the European Union is now trying to simplify the process of combining school reading in a particular country [EU](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz)and studying certain subjects online, according to the Ukrainian school program.

"In search of decisions that will help Ukrainian children, the EU countries are flexible," the European Commissariat assures.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

Report for today.

The first - I am grateful to every warrior, all our defenders and defenders who gave for this day the news we expect. Bakhmut direction - youth, warriors!

We see how hysterically Russia perceives any of our step there, all our positions.

The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to the shocks, warriors, and in particular in the Donetsk region. Thank you for it!

Today I would like to point out some of our combat units. It is a 5-story storm brigade and a 57th separate infantry brigade, who are skillfully protecting our positions, destroying the occupiers and, most importantly, move forward.

Thank you, warriors!Thank you all!

Second, we continue our work on sanctions against Russia.

Although the global trend is already understood - Russia is losing this war, businessmen continue to deny reality. They continue to try to deceive, to bypass sanctions, to produce more weapons, to provide greater waste of people's resources for this aggression.

We are preparing our steps, new steps for even greater limitation of Russian -military potential. Everyone in the world who helps the terrorist state to circumstance sanctions, everyone in the world whom Russia uses for the supply of weapons, components, equipment-every such entity must feel the full power of the free world.

And we will provide it.

This is a common task in the world - to stop terror. And the main prerequisite for this task is to stop any paths that terrorists still try to keep something for themselves.

News - soon.

Third. Today he held a long and very meaningful meeting on the transformation of a country, our lives - now and after victory.

Objectively, there are fundamental security, economic, energy, technological and simply human issues that require complete and effective answers.A strong state, a free state, a modern state, a pleasant state.

We lay the basis for this. All who are fighting for the sake of Ukraine. All who work for the sake of Ukraine. Everyone who helps.

For example, today in the format, the government, office, NSDC discussed the energy industry in a broad sense - agricultural production. Not only the restoration of what Ukraine was, but the development and expansion, taking into account the global role of Ukraine in order to food and energy security of Europe and the world.

We will present all these details. Will be thorough. In particular, we will present at the London Medical Conference on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which will take place this month.

And, of course, we do not stop our international work with partners a day.

There was a Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom today in Kyiv. Good, useful negotiations and new strengthening of our countries, our safety.

I thanked for all the defense support provided to Ukraine, and especially for the Storm Shedou missiles, which have shown themselves extremely effective in the forefront. I have been talking about a new coalition for the protection of life - Petriots.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom and NATO's training in Vilnius were spoken with Mr. The summit should be meaningful. Then it will become a tstorical.

Thank you all who help Ukraine!Thank you to everyone who brings the defeat's terror closer!

** _ Glory to our soldiers!_ **

** _ Glory to all our heroes!_ **

This decision has been announced on Monday by the EU, given the complaint of the April 2021 on Polish judicial reform since 2019, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

During the reading of the sentence in court, it is emphasized, in particular, that the Earlier Chamber of the Supreme Court [Poland] was created(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-polsa)“Does not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality.” As prescribed, the "broad and inaccurate nature" of individual provisions allows you to use the disciplinary responsibility of judges for their substantiated punishment.

It is emphasized that certain provisions of the judicial reform of the RP "incompatible with the guarantee of the report to the independent and impartial court".

On the day of announcement of the sentence, the European Commission has suspended a definition of a daily fine for Poland, but emphasized the need for Warsawaza to pay the financial punishment, which is the highest in EU history - about 550 mlneurov. These funds are automatically deducted by the European Commission from European Funds for Polish.

The decision of the EU Court is final and cannot be challenged. The court determined that the Polish should change the legislation in order to meet the European standards. Therefore, the European Commission gives time for Warsaw to change the legislation of the US. If Poland fails to enforce the decision of the EU Court, the Toevro Commission may initiate another case against Poland and in the case of a win by Poland may be a financial punishment again.

This is stated in [message](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukrainian-military-chaplains-receive-training-from-british-army)British government.

Over the past two weeks, Ukrainian chaplains have been attached to the Britain's Royal Army Department to find out more about pastoral care, spiritual support and moral leadership during military personnel, as well as the post -war recovery period.

Now they will go to Russia's front in the war with Ukraine, where their task will lead to inspire hope and restore the spirit as the troops are fighting the return of the sovereign territory of Ukraine.

A course developed by the British military chaplains and supported by the UK armed units within [Orbital Operation](https://armyinform.com.ua/2019/11/19/brytanski-instruktory-navchayut-ukrayinskyh-pihotyncziv-za-programoyu-orbital/), appeared in response to the Questionnaire of Ukraine, aimed at equipping the participants with religious tapractical resources necessary to support the staff through the most complex operations - from severe loss and to mental health problems.

“For me, it was the biggest privilege to work with our Ukrainian partners to develop an understanding of chaplains in high -intensity. Together, we looked at the central place of moral component power and the role of chaplains in its observation and support. They were able to teach us the same way as we were able to teach them. The ability to provide pastoral care, spiritual support and moral leadership has made a critical capacity for Ukrainian commanders. These ten capealities responded to the call of their people; They are no longer just our international partners, they are our colleagues and friends. I pray that God bless, protect and direct them after returning to Ukraine, ”said Reverend Michael Parker.

Much of the program was devoted to chaplaincy in an operational context, while the participants supported the Ukrainian military, who are currently undergoing a willow training in Viltshire in the framework of training of Ukrainian recruits, which is being carried out by the United Kingdom.

That is why, according to him, anti -aircraft missile systems that western partnerships will be intensified in Ukraine, and will ultimately replace the entire Soviet anti -aircraft missile weapons park.

- It will take a long time, but it will happen, there is already a decision. It is different how to completely replace the modern systems of different radius, that is, the arid missile complexes of the average radius, a small radius of action, as well as the initial missile systems capable of affecting ballistic goals, - said the spokesman of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

He also noted that it is equally important to provide Ukraine with modern combat aircraft, which will be able to strengthen the Ukrainian air defense and support the Ukrainian military during certain defensive or offensive actions.

- We have a key solution today. Just so no one is not aircraft, a political decision was needed, and it is. This continuous process of Ivin is sure to happen. We only want to accelerate it and attract more countries to this process, so that not only sufficient aircraft are provided to partners, but also a sufficient number of different weapons to them. I think we will gradually get everything we need today. Some rockets, bombs and winged rockets have already been adapted even to Soviet equipment, however, it does not work as effectively as it would be on Western fighters.

About it [stated](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-to-the-board-of-governors-5-jun-2023)CEO Rafael Mariano Grossi to his speech to the Council of the Agency Managing Agency.

He noted that groups of IAEA experts remain not only the Nazaposhzhia NPPs, but also at all nuclear power plants of Ukraine, carrying out monitoring and daily reporting on the development of events in the field of nuclear taphysical protection. In total, 81 experts of 37 missions have rotated the facilities in Ukraine.

The IAEA head has stated that in recent months there has been an increase in military activity, and therefore three existing nuclear power plants in Ukraine were able to reduce their capacity directly due to hostilities. In addition, all stations have encountered problems with the supply of spare parts.

According to Grossi, from now on, experts of the IAEA mission will report to him, as a CEO of these principles, and he will publicly tell him about any violations.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Euractiv](https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/news/natos-headquarters-to-expand-to-make-room-for-future-members/).

According to the four NATO diplomats, who have talked to Euractiv on the conditions of Annoyma, the Alliance building in Brussels, opened in 2018, becomes too small to place delegations of future NATO members.

“Finland's transition to headquarters ** [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)** It will be completed within the next weeks and months, ”the NATO official confirmed, adding that it will also relate to Sweden," it will just join NATO as a full member. "

But the problem is that none of these delegations will fit in existing buildings.

To date, the delegations of Finland, Sweden and other partner countries have been located the NATO Early Headquarters-an old complex built in the Cold War, on Leopold III Boulevard.

Since NATO diplomats and officials envisaged the expansion of the Alliance in the future, the overall idea was to build an additional wing in the new headquarters when the time would come.

However, Finland has already joined NATO, Sweden is now intending to become a member, and the potential entry of Ukraine and Georgia is not excluded in the near future.

One of the decisions considered by the Alliance is the construction of additional construction in the territory of the NATO military town, where international employees and agencies could accommodate, two NATO diplomats said. Tybulo would only be a "temporary solution", but a quick solution to the problem for giving urgent needs.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Euractiv](https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/news/natos-headquarters-to-expand-to-make-room-for-future-members/).

According to the four NATO diplomats, who have talked to Euractiv on the conditions of Annoyma, the Alliance building in Brussels, opened in 2018, becomes too small to place delegations of future NATO members.

“Finland's transition to headquarters ** [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)** It will be completed within the next weeks and months, ”the NATO official confirmed, adding that it will also relate to Sweden," it will just join NATO as a full member. "

But the problem is that none of these delegations will fit in existing buildings.

To date, the delegations of Finland, Sweden and other partner countries have been located the NATO Early Headquarters-an old complex built in the Cold War, on Leopold III Boulevard.

Since NATO diplomats and officials envisaged the expansion of the Alliance in the future, the overall idea was to build an additional wing in the new headquarters when the time would come.

However, Finland has already joined NATO, Sweden is now intending to become a member, and the potential entry of Ukraine and Georgia is not excluded in the near future.

One of the decisions considered by the Alliance is the construction of additional construction in the territory of the NATO military town, where international employees and agencies could accommodate, two NATO diplomats said. Tybulo would only be a "temporary solution", but a quick solution to the problem for giving urgent needs.
