<p>About this today during a virtual participation in a security conference, which was within the framework of the European Council of External Relations(ECFR)In Stockholm, Olga Stephanyshyn, Ukrinform correspondent, said Viceremier-Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Whatever the NATO Summit Decision on Ukraine's membership, it should meet the interests of the Allies and Ukraine. It should not be accepted by the scattering of the fear before Moscow or fear of its reaction to the return of the territories of Ukraine. We do not have to allow Russia to blackmail us, ”the Ukrainian official said.</p>

Such solutions should not be limited to political declarations or memoranda, which, according to Stephanyshina, Ukraine has seen a lot over the past. These can be security guarantees, which are supported by specific administrative and military capabilities, specific obligations of the excavation of international organizations.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian viceremier recalled that granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country to entry into the EU has become a powerful incentive for the whole country in mobilization to reform even in war conditions, as well as an important factor in the implementation of an e-European path for other candidate countries, including Moldova and Georgia. The effect for Ukraine will also have a clear Euro -Atlantic perspective.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3715236-nova-arhitektura-bezpeki-evropi-nemozliva-bez-integracii-ukraini-stefanisina.html">New European Security Architecture is impossible without integration of Ukraine - <strong> Stephanyshina </strong></a>According to her, the Allies have no doubt that Ukraine will be a member of NATO. Ukraine has received enormous military assistance from NATO, it is moving to the full compatibility with the Alliance's troops and has powerful land forces that are most capable not only in Europe but in the world. Therefore, the Usuznikov has every reason to respond positively to the application of Ukraine on membership. At the same time, the "political choreography" of this process must still be worked out.</p>
<p>“My position may seem too radical or energetic. But it is worthwhile to get unique features of Ukrainian politics during a war, which is not always clear to others. Our armed forces and managers at local and central levels - we have become one. At some point, politicians began to think and evaluate the situation as the military. At the same time, our military, they know what we need to do to bring the country closer to the EU and NATO, it is an investment in the future for which they are fighting, ”Ukraine emphasized.</p>
<p>She stressed that during the year of the struggle, Ukrainians proved that Russia could not be in Ukraine by any of the military or political purposes. The war has left the unity of Ukrainian society in the fight against the enemy, as the question of survival and response to existential threats are higher than any political electoral processes or differences.</p>

Instead, it has received strong Euro -Atlantic solidarity and almost two thousand kilometers with the Alliance after Finland's entry and shortly - Sweden.It was reported that on July 11-12 in Vilnius there will be another NATO summit, which will consider the continuation of assistance to Ukraine in the fight against Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his intention to personally take part in this storage. At the same time, at all levels, the Ukrainian side emphasized that assurances about the fact that "Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance", which were made during the NATO time summit in 2008, is not enough. Instead, the Ukrainian will be about NATO allies to provide safety guarantees of a touching movement for full membership in the Alliance.</p>

<p>"I want to say that there are so many processes in recent times. In this Tszarin, more and more countries are found in their territory of so -called" agents of influence ", direct spies that worked for the Russian Federation. Two or three years in the past and that is now, they are crazy shifts in this field. Recently, I am seeking the Security Service of Ukraine, military counterintelligence, counterintelligence, which are more and more finding more and more of those people who were in one time. We performed certain tasks, and we almost every day we have the report of the head of the Child General's Security Service with the results that the Security Service of Ukraine has, ”Danilov said.</p>

It is the church of the Moscow Patriarchate, which has nothing to do. These are athletes and all other institutions. Some journalists do not row from the hands of the Russian agency in order to be certain narratives In the light of being about the lie that they spread relative to our country. We are now working out in these areas and we and partners, "the NSDC Secretary said.</p>

<p>In an interview, Ukrinform was emphasized by a well -known Polish expert, an eczeper of Poland's Land Forces, former Deputy Minister of National Defense of the country Waldemar Sklipchak.</p>
<p>“Russian propaganda and money of Russian oligarchs who still sponsor the change of the event, sow these doubts(Concerning the responsibility of Russia or Ukraine for Podryvkakhovskaya <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ges">HPP</a>- order.). Але ніхто звійськових не має сумніву, що це зробили росіяни”, - наголосив Скшипчак.</p>
<p>За його словами, у росіян для цього давно було все готове. Зокрема, вони щеторік розмістили там вибухівку, коли українська армія вела активну операцію наХерсонському напрямку.</p>
<p>“Вони чекали на відповідний момент, оскільки бояться українськогоконтрнаступу. Російська армія перелякалася українських дій на Бахмутському іХарківському напрямках і на Запоріжжі, де українська армія атакує, хоча це щене контрнаступ, а оперативне введення противника в оману”, - підкресливексперт.</p>

<p>In his opinion, there should be a corresponding resolution at the UN level that Russia is responsible for this.</p>
<p>"This is an inhuman act, but it is necessary to realize that they have always acted, even with respect to their citizens," the expert stated.</p>
<p>Instead, the Polish General noted in the military plan, it will be difficult to cross the Dnieper over two to three weeks because of the blast, as the flow of water should be reduced and the shores should be reduced.</p>
<p>“The Russians were frightened because they thought that the Ukrainian army had crossed in several directions, so, undermining the dam, they defended their expositions from the west, so that the Dnipro would not go Ukrainian forces. It was their military step, since some of the forces from the south of the Russians were thrown to Nazapore, fearing that it would be the direction of the main blow to the Ukrainian army, ”the Edamer of Poland Land Forces emphasized.<strong> Read also: </strong> [Ukraine appealed to the ECtHR through the Russian terrorist attack on <strong> Kakhov </strong>(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3720141-ukraina-zvernulasa-do-espl-cerez-rosijskij-terakt-na-kahovskij-ges.html)“But, in my opinion, the Russians were miscalculated because this direction was not considered by the Ukrainian command as the chief. The main focus is a place where there is more opportunity to maneuver and you do not need to force the driver, ”Sklipchak emphasized.</p>
<p>He added that the forcing of the Dnieper could be an extremely difficult thing.</p>
<p>“The one who forced big rivers knows how difficult it is. I forced a wand, the guard, the Vistula(Rivers in Poland - ed.)- This is a very complex organizational process.</p>

<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6p-MaVXNkY">appeal</a>To the representatives of the world ecological community, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua">Presidential Office</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Good day!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Congratulations to all of you!</strong></p>
<p>All who did not remain indifferent to see this man -made disaster of the Nakakhovsky hydroelectric power station.</p>
<p>It is not a natural disaster or a manifestation of a climatic crisis, it is a disaster. What he will make. What he personally orders to do.</p>
<p>The situation is extremely difficult. Russian troops do not stop artillery for the territory where the evacuation of people is carried out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are wounded from these terrorist shelling. People who rescue from Russian ecocide are forced to escape from the Russian fire!Just at evacuation points ... This Russian ecocid crime is the greatest decade in Europe, but, apparently, Russian invaders decide to worsen its consequences. In the occupied part of the territory, about a dozen settlements have been deapated, novacuation is not carried out. People on the second day on the roofs, in a water trap, without drinking water, food of Twedic help. We do not know how many dead and victims are killed.</p>
<p>Just an hour is installed every hour - and we are installing - more and more details of what damage Russia has caused this disaster. In more than 30 inhabited pens of life is broken. For hundreds of thousands of people in many cities and villages, access to drinking water is much prepared.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-08T21-39-00-03-00/1686249669-488.jpeg" />Due to the destruction of the dam, flooded fuel storage facilities, warehouses with chemicals, warehouses, the burial grounds of animals, of which are at least two "anthrax burials", and Iobidv - in the temporarily occupied territory. What is with them now, we are unknown. There, where there was no centralized sewage, sewage runoff is already in water, which is covered by everything ...</p>
<p>The number of ecosystems that are destroyed or put on the border of the extinction of this terrorist attack is already calculated by thousands. More than 50,000 hectares have been brought down, and at least half of them will die. Tens of thousands of birds are at least twenty thousand wild animals under the threat of death. Obviously, the Kkakhov reservoir has been transformed into a large grave for millions of living things.First. Of course, we will continue to do our best to save as much people. And we need support for the world. And not only to the rhetoric, but also actions. In the territories of the territory, international organizations were assisted. I thank. In the occupied territory - zero support. And every longer it lasts, moreover, unfortunately, there will be casualties.</p>
<p>There are no attention to international organizations to the occupied territory, which is flooded. And you need, in particular, your pressure on them - I ask!</p>
<p>Second. All this we encountered is a conscious crime of the occupier. Multiple about what happened. But it happened in the occupied territory. But we have warned the mining of the dams and other buildings. But Russian troops are now firing areas where evacuation is ongoing. It is obvious that it is Russia who is interested in a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Just as we have created special expert groups that are engaged in promoting sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine, we also create an expert group, which will be primarily to engage in the consolidation of the world, so that the ecocide is full of Russian and that our country does not remain alone with this. I am sure that with sufficient leadership in the world, you can create.</p>
<p>Third. Any terrorist expects only a few forms of result for themselves: it is the suffering of people, it is intimidation of people and these are the ruins left after the sebeter. This is how Russia works in this.</p>
<p>Of course, we will do everything to guarantee people the basis for life even after this disaster. But it is necessary that no desert, or ruins, a mint area after this disaster. And this can be provided only by joint ventures, along with the eco -protection community of the world, along with Policy Makers, single -bearing leaders and states, together with international organizations.</p>
<p>Pollution and poison from the flood zone quickly enters groundwater, poisons rivers, and from there enters the Black Sea basin. That is, the nature of nature "somewhere" is not very interconnected in the world.</p>
<p>And so please spread the truth about this Russian ecocide. Please call the leaders, states and international organizations to act. It is no coincidence that we have a formula of peace, one of the key points is the anti -speaking. Please let's make it so that other ecocides are not more. Join our community that I said to our platform, to our experts. We are on constant contact.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your attention!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>About this today during a virtual participation in a security conference, which was within the framework of the European Council of External Relations(ECFR)In Stockholm, Olga Stephanyshyn, Ukrinform correspondent, said Viceremier-Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Whatever the NATO Summit Decision on Ukraine's membership, it should meet the interests of the Allies and Ukraine. It should not be accepted by the scattering of the fear before Moscow or fear of its reaction to the return of the territories of Ukraine. We do not have to allow Russia to blackmail us, ”the Ukrainian official said.</p>

Such solutions should not be limited to political declarations or memoranda, which, according to Stephanyshina, Ukraine has seen a lot over the past. These can be security guarantees, which are supported by specific administrative and military capabilities, specific obligations of the excavation of international organizations.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian viceremier recalled that granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country to entry into the EU has become a powerful incentive for the whole country in mobilization to reform even in war conditions, as well as an important factor in the implementation of an e-European path for other candidate countries, including Moldova and Georgia. The effect for Ukraine will also have a clear Euro -Atlantic perspective.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3715236-nova-arhitektura-bezpeki-evropi-nemozliva-bez-integracii-ukraini-stefanisina.html">New European Security Architecture is impossible without integration of Ukraine - <strong> Stephanyshina </strong></a>According to her, the Allies have no doubt that Ukraine will be a member of NATO. Ukraine has received enormous military assistance from NATO, it is moving to the full compatibility with the Alliance's troops and has powerful land forces that are most capable not only in Europe but in the world. Therefore, the Usuznikov has every reason to respond positively to the application of Ukraine on membership. At the same time, the "political choreography" of this process must still be worked out.</p>
<p>“My position may seem too radical or energetic. But it is worthwhile to get unique features of Ukrainian politics during a war, which is not always clear to others. Our armed forces and managers at local and central levels - we have become one. At some point, politicians began to think and evaluate the situation as the military. At the same time, our military, they know what we need to do to bring the country closer to the EU and NATO, it is an investment in the future for which they are fighting, ”Ukraine emphasized.</p>
<p>She stressed that during the year of the struggle, Ukrainians proved that Russia could not be in Ukraine by any of the military or political purposes. The war has left the unity of Ukrainian society in the fight against the enemy, as the question of survival and response to existential threats are higher than any political electoral processes or differences.</p>

Instead, it has received strong Euro -Atlantic solidarity and almost two thousand kilometers with the Alliance after Finland's entry and shortly - Sweden.It was reported that on July 11-12 in Vilnius there will be another NATO summit, which will consider the continuation of assistance to Ukraine in the fight against Russian aggression. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his intention to personally take part in this storage. At the same time, at all levels, the Ukrainian side emphasized that assurances about the fact that "Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance", which were made during the NATO time summit in 2008, is not enough. Instead, the Ukrainian will be about NATO allies to provide safety guarantees of a touching movement for full membership in the Alliance.</p>

How to maintain the mental health of military personnel and all social education. " The event was attended by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Hannamar.</p>
<p>It was impossible to prepare for the war of this scale, but in Ukraine there was a community that takes care of the mental health of the whole nation, the defense ministry was also involved in these processes. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, as part of Ukrainian society, need help in this area.</p>
<p>According to Anna Malyar, there are now several challenges before the department: a significant increase in the number of servicemen, a deficit of military psychologists with tadoming of stereotypes and stigmatization about the psychological assistance of media servants.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a large -scale invasion of psychological assistance, every information needs. Speaking of the military, it is almost a million army. Provisional psychologists are impossible today. Therefore, there was a state decision on the creation of a body that will coordinate work in this work. After all, we did not have an institution that we have shot how many psychologists, what their qualification.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-08T40-00-00-04-00/5f9a9114.jpg" />Due to the military specificity and security issues with servicemen, only military psychologists are currently working. According to the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, some steps have already been taken in the Armed Forces to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>-First, we carried out targeted mobilization for available vacancies and conducted appropriate training in working with the military. Secondly, civil organizations and civilian psychologists who have been working on this front since 2014 are already involved and carrying all this burden on themselves, ”she said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-08T40-00-00-04-00/5f9a9091.jpg" />Anna Malyar also emphasized that a serious challenge remains the stigmatization of psychological problems. After all, psychological assistance is provided on voluntary basis, a person has the right not to consult a specialist, and stereotypes prevent people from admit that they need such help. Therefore, the primary task of the help of help remains an explanatory work. Now it is extremely necessary to translate psychological help on the usual thing.<em>Foto: Nazar Voloshin</em></p>

For this purpose, All -Ukrainian Programming Health is created, which will provide every citizen with a system of quality services and services and will help to restore the war damaged by the war, to turn to a fulfilling life. Oksana Zabitneva, the head of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, told this during the roundtable meeting at the Military Media Center on the theme "War Against our Souls. How to maintain the mental health of the military personnel of the society. "</p>
<ul>
<li>Every restored person is working capacity, it is an economy. Even if we rebuild beautiful cities, in those beautiful walls there will be living people who will not have the strength and ability to create something to rejoice. What is happening today, but also on those forecasts and challenges that will be after victory. We will take a person - a person will restore everything. The first lady said so well, ”Oksana Zabitnev said.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to her, aspects and components that are components of the mental health care are in every sector and in every industry. Therefore, relevant ministries need to unite, coordinate, and interact in order for their approved decisions in this field to create a chain of services and services that support a person to support a person on the way to mental recovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the most important meaning that involves the All -Ukrainian Mental Health Program. We all have to become a united human recovery forces - a large layer of work ahead, - Oksana Zbitneva emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Head of the Coordination Center for Mental Health of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the scale of the problem and the point of reference will now be estimated, which will be based on a state level plan.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of the World Health Organization, in your pyramid of services, which is an expert partner of creating an all -Ukrainian program of health health, you must first build a plan at the state level, provide services in communities and create a specialized assistance system.According to her, in the organization of the system of services, Ukraine faces descent and large -scale challenges: what should be the education, what should be the programming of specialists, whether they bring up new experience and new knowledge.</p>
<p>What the system of services and services should be after the war - how to properly organize it in order for a person not to lose in the era of post -war changes, the vibration cannot cope with new challenges.</p>
<p>It is necessary to decide how the training of specialists of specialized assistance will be prepared, who will determine their level of qualification and how they will ensure their installation in the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we are actively raising this topic at all levels, we will also swing the adventure market, but we do not have the appropriate legislation, regulation of the nations of the sphere, a person does not know how to choose a specialist, to be sure that she will be able to be professionally, - said Oksana Zbitneva.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the state coordination system is built on the part of the state - each of the ministry presented its priority project. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine presented a large five -layer and multilayered restoration for armed forces. A system of regional coordination is created - every OVA has a deputy responsible for mental health, a system of services and services provided in the community is created.</p>
<p>But what is important: if this component is not built in defense, the tops of the military in civil life will not cope with these flows that have the unique combat experience and the traumatic events experienced, the military psychologists are able to work. Therefore, it is important here that they will be common and strong in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, the non -governmental sector and international partners give the state a very significantformer, so far they close the urgent needs, but we have a built -in state mechanism to answer this a huge question, - Oksana Zabitneva reported.</li>

<p>"As for Mr. Rasmussen's statement, we would very much like security guarantees(For Ukraine - ed.)They were not guarantees of the Budapest sample of 1994, but were guarantees effective and binding. When Putin was active in the war in February 2014, and then again in February 2022, he intended that NATO would in no way expand or approach the Russian borders. As a result, we see that today's Finland is almost members of the Alliance. Both one and the other are near the spray, and one at its border. And the fact that we will be members of the Alliance is a question of time. This is our norm of the Constitution, which no one will be cleaned from there. We will be sure to be there because we are worth being in a single family that supports democracy and meets NATO countries, " - said Danivilov.</p>

About it was told by the head of the Center for Defense Strategies, the head of the international director in the coalition of Rise-Ukraine, the head of the analytical direction of the Tastregical Advocacy .(https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/07/dlya-nablyzhennya-peremogy-ukrayiny-potribno-vkladatysya-v-yiyi-vidbudovu-vzhe-sogodni-olesya-ogryzko/).</p>
<p>— Тому те, що ми можемо всі робити, незалежно від того, чим ми займаємося, —це розповідати про наші реформи, про історії успіху. Навіть якщо це історіяуспіху маленької громади. До прикладу, громади Тростянця, там де люди простонеймовірні, які одразу ж після деокупації просто зібралися і, не чекаючидопомоги, в унісон працюють, як злагоджений вулик, і відбудовують себе. Таксамо, як жителі Ірпеня, Бучі, Гостомеля також почали латати свої будівлі.Тому, якщо складно говорити про реформи, про якісь трансформації, яківідбулися за останніх 9 років після Революції Гідності, просто розповідайтеісторії про те, яке ми сильне суспільство, як ми боремося за всі ті цінності,за які стоїть весь цивілізований світ. Тим самим ми проявляємо себе івідкриваємо серця людей за кордоном, — зазначила Олеся Огризко.</p>

Understanding and fearing the offensive of the Ukrainian forces in this way, the enemy went to this barbaric crime, ”explained the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, adding that the situation could get out of control for the occupational occupiers.</p>
<p>Andriy Yusov also informed that part of the personnel was given the enemy to the enemy prepared positions for the commission of a terrorist attack, but some occupation units that were on the left bank of the Dnieper were not aware of the Podryvkakhovsky Hydroelectric Power Plant.</p>

<p>In the settlements of the temporarily captured territory of the Kherson region, Russian invaders continue to use the consequences of their crime in their purposes. In particular, people who were evacuated from flooded populated areas are displaced in boarding houses and recreation centers, where the Ukrainian units are already located. Thus, the invaders try to protect themselves, hiding themselves in the civilian population.</p>
<p>Also, according to available information, the Russian military leadership has significant problems with the material support of their troops. Soldiers who have differently signed a contract in military units stationed in Mystovlgograd, issued boots instead of boots with high berets. In addition, contractors are forced to buy a military uniform at their own expense.</p>

<p><strong> _ Congratulations to all of you!_ </strong></p>
<p>All who did not remain indifferent to see this man -made disaster of the Nakakhovsky hydroelectric power station.</p>
<p>It is not a natural disaster or a manifestation of a climatic crisis, it is a disaster. What he will make. What he personally orders to do.</p>
<p>The situation is extremely difficult. Russian troops do not stop artillery for the territory where the evacuation of people is carried out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are wounded from these terrorist shelling. People who rescue from Russian ecocide are forced to escape from the Russian fire!Just at evacuation points ... This Russian ecocid crime is the greatest decade in Europe, but, apparently, Russian invaders decide to worsen its consequences. In the occupied part of the territory, about a dozen settlements have been deapated, novacuation is not carried out. People on the second day on the roofs, in a water trap, without drinking water, food of Twedic help. We do not know how many dead and victims are killed.</p>
<p>Just an hour is installed every hour - and we are installing - more and more details of what damage Russia has caused this disaster. In more than 30 inhabited pens of life is broken. For hundreds of thousands of people in many cities and villages, access to drinking water is much prepared.</p>
<p>Due to the destruction of the dam, flooded fuel storage facilities, warehouses with chemicals, warehouses, the burial grounds of animals, of which are at least two "anthrax burials", and Iobidv - in the temporarily occupied territory. What is with them now, we are unknown. There, where there was no centralized sewage, sewage runoff is already in water, which is covered by everything ...</p>
<p>The number of ecosystems that are destroyed or put on the border of the extinction of this terrorist attack is already calculated by thousands. More than 50,000 hectares have been brought down, and at least half of them will die. Tens of thousands of birds are at least twenty thousand wild animals under the threat of death. Obviously, the Kkakhov reservoir has been transformed into a large grave for millions of living things.</p>
<p>No people have to remain alone with such challenges!But there is no answer to how we can overcome it all.There are no attention to international organizations to the occupied territory, which is flooded. And you need, in particular, your pressure on them - I ask!</p>
<p>Second. All this we encountered is a conscious crime of the occupier. Multiple about what happened. But it happened in the occupied territory. But we have warned the mining of the dams and other buildings. But Russian troops are now firing areas where evacuation is ongoing. It is obvious that it is Russia who is interested in a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Just as we have created special expert groups that are engaged in promoting sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine, we also create an expert group, which will be primarily to engage in the consolidation of the world, so that the ecocide is full of Russian and that our country does not remain alone with this. I am sure that with sufficient leadership in the world, you can create.</p>
<p>Third. Any terrorist expects only a few forms of result for themselves: it is the suffering of people, it is intimidation of people and these are the ruins left after the sebeter. This is how Russia works in this.</p>
<p>Of course, we will do everything to guarantee people the basis for life even after this disaster. But it is necessary that no desert, or ruins, a mint area after this disaster. And this can be provided only by joint ventures, along with the eco -protection community of the world, along with Policy Makers, single -bearing leaders and states, together with international organizations.</p>
<p>Pollution and poison from the flood zone quickly enters groundwater, poisons rivers, and from there enters the Black Sea basin. That is, the nature of nature "somewhere" is not very interconnected in the world.</p>
<p>And so please spread the truth about this Russian ecocide. Please call the leaders, states and international organizations to act. It is no coincidence that we have a formula of peace, one of the key points is the anti -speaking. Please let's make it so that other ecocides are not more. Join our community that I said to our platform, to our experts. We are on constant contact.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you for your attention!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

<p>Today was a very long, hard day. Kherson and the region, Mykolaiv region, the cities of the Gromad of our Dniprovshchyna. Meetings, meetings, evacuation points, international recovery.</p>
<p>First. At all levels of the state and local authorities, we work to save as much people from flooded areas. The evacuation is ongoing. Everywhere we can pull people out of the flood area, we do it. SES, police, military - youth!Everyone and everyone who is involved - I want to thank you!</p>
<p>Second. In our free territory there is the presence of international organizations, specific assistance. In particular, it is the Ukrainian Red Cross and many others. Every organization, every volunteer, is for every company that has realized for a rescue operation.</p>
<p>And it is obvious that the absence of some international organizations in the disaster zone in the occupied territory - the same International Red Cross, is the union of their assistance to our people in the occupied territory for such organizations, it seems wrong and is simply self -destruction.</p>
<p>Third. Russian terrorists are trying to aggravate the situation they have caused their ecocid. Absolutely conscious. They continue the firing of the nih and communities of the region, already flooded by terrorists. They fireting even the evacuation points that are already such a manifestation of evil, which, apparently, no terrorists of the World, except Russian, have not gone.</p>
<p>The invaders completely threw people on the left -bank part of the Serson region. There, the second day is just expanding the catastrophe. And it is also a conscious choice of Russian leadership. There is no one in the world now who saw that Russia is in charge of Russia. Non -human, which is personally the most catastrophe on the planet today.</p>
<p>We have to do everything with our partners to make the world prove that it is able to cope with such catastrophes, with such terrorists.The situation with infrastructure, natural loss. It is a significant harm from the Russian terrorist attack, it is clear to everyone. But it should also be clear that there are no alternatives, except for maximum restoration and maximum reconstruction. It is possible that Russia will remain devastated after Putin, but not Ukraine.</p>
<p>And one more. Mandatory. Security. Constantly in communication with our military. Commander - Khortytsia, Tavriya, all those involved in the hottest. Donetsk is very rigid battles. But there is a result, and I am grateful to anyone who provides this result!Bakhmut - Well done. Step by step. Thank you every warrior!Avdiivka, Marinka, all over the East, the situation in the south, the situation after blasting the Russians of our native Kakhovka's dams - we see every detail. But to be published - not today.</p>
<p><strong> Thanks to our people!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>The water level in the reservoir fell approximately 4.1 m after the dam and the reached point of 12.7 m at 18:00 today. The hourly rate of loss remains in the range of 4-7 cm/h.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/shtab_kakhovska_hes/227">reports</a>The headquarters of the elimination of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station by Russian terrorists.</p>
<p>◼️ZaS has the ability to pump water from the tank even after its level falls below 12.7 m. Probably pumps can operate at a level of 11 m or below.</p>
<p>In these difficult circumstances, this gives extra time before the possible transition of a heater water supply, including a large consolidator pond nearby.</p>
<p>It is no less no less nuclear safety remains stupid and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>◼️To it is better to evaluate the situation, IAEA experts have invited access to the location of the water level in the reservoir and to the outlet of the ZTO, which is adjacent.</p>
