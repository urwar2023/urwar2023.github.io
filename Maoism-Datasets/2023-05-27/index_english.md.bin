![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T32-00-00-04-00/fukuyama.jpg)This was stated by Professor of Stanford University Francis Fukuyama to address the participants of the 15th Annual Kiev Security Forum, the Army Informs Correspondent reports.

Francis Fukuyama noted that any peace agreements could not be effective for Ukraine without joining NATO, as time will allow Russia to re-arry and continue the war.

- Under the current conditions, peace talks and temporary ceasefire can be damaged by Ukraine. After all, it can leave Russia control over the Donbass, Crimea of the southern coast of Ukraine. And here is an even deeper problem. While Vladimir Putin when the power, any "peace agreements" will simply allow Russia to re-arry their own to later restore the war. Any long settlement has a stronger security guarantees for Ukraine,-Francisfukuyama stressed.

He believes that the renewal of war with Russia in the future can only a member of Ukraine in NATO and the guarantees provided for in Article 5.

- NATO membership will become real if, thanks to the counter -offensive, Ukraine is Retrachrson and Zaporizhzhya regions, - said Professor of the Stanford University. - The fear of slow blocking of Crimea can encourage Putinovation of attacks on Ukraine, unlock Ukrainian ports on a long -term basis to cause terrorist missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Francis Fukuyama stressed that the effectiveness of any arrangements with Russia will depend on Ukraine's membership in NATO.

- While we are waiting for the Ukrainian counter -offensive to begin, we need to think about what this war can end. As I said, peaceful and ceasefires in the current circumstances will be a very bad idea for Ukraine. Every member of NATO, who has doubts about this, must say how much a peace agreement is possible in the following years, not simply a short -term suppression of fire and the opportunity for Russia to overthrow themselves, to rebuild the Higherly to restore the war, - said Frances Fukuyama.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T81-00-00-04-00/foto-01.jpg)On the evening of May 24, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that at about 5:30 armed Ukraine "made a futile attempt to attack three unmanned speed boats" the ship "Ivan Hurs". According to Russia's military collection, the intelligence vessel was fulfilled by the security of the functioning of gas pipelines "in the exclusive economic zonituretsky Republic" of 140 km northeast of the Bosphorus Strait. Evenly, it was stated that all boats were "destroyed by fire from the regular weapons of the Russian ship", which allegedly confirmed a video with the defeat of one delay.

But in a day, probably enjoying the unreasonable triumph of the enemy, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1661789365582921744)Video "Romantic Meeting" of our surface drone with a reconnaissance ship.

“When the Russian reconnaissance ship" Ivan Hurs "met the Ukrainian non -infantry. Indeed, the perfect couple!”, - accompanied by Mow such signature.

> WHEN The Russian Reconnaissance Ship "Ivan Khurs" Met A Ukrainian Drone. > Indeed, a perfect match!> [Pic.twitter.com/mw3cld0vhh](https://t.co/mW3clD0vHh)>> — Defense of Ukraine(@DefenceU)[May 25,> 2023](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1661789365582921744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)The Ukrainian video refutes the official version of the enemy that Ivan Hurs was not abused, because the frames are broken only after the drone approached the left feed. Judging by the powerful explosion of the lined boat, the other, not destroyed, the Moods to cause a lot of harm to the reconnaissance vessel.

At our request for the combat capabilities of Ivan Hursa and its importance for the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, the Armyinform readers were told by the Head of the Department and Navy of the National Defense University of Ukraine named after Ivanachernyakhovsky captain Stepan Yakimak.

- This ship was not intended for the Black Sea Fleet, but for the Pvenokoean, - said Stepan Yakimak. - But in 2017, the Russian reconnaissance ship "Liman" was in black when he stood on an anchor of the Bubbosphorus, and a ship with sheep came in. Therefore, the decision to proceed Ivan Hurs to the Black Sea Fleet was made.- From the beginning of the large -scale invasion of Ivan Hurs, the entrance has been actively involved, - says Stepan Yakimak. - was involved in reconnaissance in various blacks of the Black Sea, performing a wide range of intelligence tasks. In particular, we observed that it periodically went into the area between the Ostrovomia and the Odessa gas field.

Ivan Hurs reconnaissance ship can be in an autonomous supply for more than a month, so it has for a long time to identify our strengths at sea and the scienceshore, listened to the Navy radar stations, as well as our retortal defense, etc.

- This is a traditional task for reconnaissance ships, - says Stepanayak. - listening to radio channels, detection of active stations, and such intelligence always operates in the complex: there are certain coastal systems and centers, such -ship elements, as well as space, air. Ivan Hursa's ships are important for the intelligence information to become reliable. Their role is important because they unfold directly in the right areas, which can not be made by coastal or air.

According to the Head of the Department of the Navy of the National University of Defense of Ukraine, Ivan Hurs reconnaissance operated in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, from the Danube Girle line to Cape Sarich in the Crimea-an area that the Russian Federation declared after the invasion. And this ship depended on 40-60 percent of the success of the goals in our forces in the fighting area.

- There are other Russian reconnaissance ships, but they are older, have a native motorcycle and less ability to intelligence, - says Stepan Yakimak. -Therefore, in the case of disruption of this key ship, the proponent loses these significant 40-60 percent of the accuracy of information that gives a complex intelligence system.

In addition to monitoring our forces, judging from the place of attack on the Bilyabosphorus ship, he could monitor the activity of Romania, Turkey and other countries in the Black Sea, as well as civilian navigation.

As for the attack on Ivan Hursa, according to Stepan Yakimak, it is not Moglas to serious resistance, because reconnaissance ships have lightwear and usually perform their tasks in safe areas. But avoiding the reach of our "Neptune", the Russians were miscalculated.

[!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T81-00-00-04-00/foto-02-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/foto-02.jpg)

_No image from above: 1)the frame of the explosion of our surface drone; 2)the personnel of the other drone to the Russian ship._

-By the way, I emphasize that Ivan Hurs is a legitimate goal for our forces, where Vinne is, because it is a ship of the Black Sea Fleet,-says a naval expert. - According to international law, we should only guarantee the safety of more vessels that can be near it during the attack.

Stepan Vladimirovich explains that the Russians try to cover themselves with the term "exclusive economic zone" of Turkey, but the stay in it does not protect the ship from the attack, because they are waters called the "open sea", that is, an actor outside the territorial seas of state Actions would really be illegal.

As for the damage that the Russian ship could theoretically suffer, judging by the scattered videos, Stepan Yakimak believes that they can be significant: the power of the explosion of the destroyed boat plus the impact of another drone is predicted by the vessel.

- They hit the forage part of the left side, - analyzes Stepan Vladimirovich. —The at a depth of 1.5-2 meters is one of the roweds of the screw. It is even a hotter for the Russians than the screw itself. The cavities of both screws are such special -trimming, which go to the machine compartment, and they are difficult to manufacture so that there is no vibration and so on. If you bend a little, it leads to the fact that this valor becomes generally unusable.

In addition, about the fact that could be seriously damaged by both valov drives(tagvins)They also say data of the international traffic information system of vessels, which shows the movement in real time. According to Stepan Yakimak, this global -system showed about 0.8 nodes after the attack.

- Roughly speaking, he went at a speed of less than two kilometers per hour, receiving a full -time speed at least 12 knots - at the combat or even fuel -economic course, - says Stepan Vladimirovich. - So the damage is serious.

The expert notes that with the estimated mass of explosives of 50-70 kilograms, punching directly into board the ship can create a hole with a diameter of about a meter. If they have a struggle for the vastability of the vessel, then the crew could somehow seize the feed compartment and get to the area of repair base.

Danilov said this in an interview with [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-65725004), reports Ukrinform.

It is reported that Danilov did not name the date of the counter -offensive, instead, he noted that in order to conquer the territory in Putin's occupation forces, it may begin "tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or a week."

He warned that the Ukrainian government "has no right to make a mistake" in this decision, since it is a "historical opportunity" that "we cannot lose".

During the interview, Danilov also confirmed that some forces of mercenaries Wagner were departed from Bakhmut. He reported their regrouping in three other places and stressed that "this does not mean that they would stop fighting with carriers."

The publication states that Ukraine planned a counter -offensive for several months. But she wanted to have as much time as possible to prepare the troops of military equipment from Western allies.

"It would be amazing if I called the beginnings of the beginning of certain events. This cannot be done .... We have a very responsible task for our country. And we understand that we have no right to mistake," - said [Danilov.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-danilov)The official rejected the assumption that the counter -offensive had already begun, stating that "the destruction of Russian management and Russian military equipment" was a task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since February 24 last year.

Danilov supported the decision of the Ukrainian army to fight in Bakhmut over the months.

"Bakhmut is our land, our territory, and we must protect it," said it added, "If we start leaving every settlement, it can bring to our western border, as Putin wanted from the first days of the war."

According to him, "we control only a small portion of the city, and we specify it. But you must remember that Bakhmut has played a big role in this.""It is not some news for us," Danilov commented.

About it reports [NHK](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20230527_11/), reports Ukrinform.

The military worked out actions in the event of an invasion of the enemy into one of the receded Japanese islands. Self -defense forces sent to this area intelligence officers and launched drones to monitor the situation, then sent a landing brigade of rapid response, which worked out the tactical seizure of the attack and the liberation of the island.

During the exercises, the military used weapons, in particular, they fired at fire cars.

Previously, such training with combat shooting was open to the public, collecting more than 20,000 spectators each year. However, for the last three years, public reviews have been canceled through the Crownavirus pandemic.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-27T13-23-00-03-00/630_360_1594380490-827.jpg)In Hungary, the results of sociological surveys certify the presence of a powerful industrial segment.

The social psychologist, executive director of the Independent Institute of Political Research, Analysis and Consulting of Political Capital in Budapestipetler Kreco at the Lviv Media Forum, said the correspondent of Ukrinform.

According to the scientist, the Political Capital recently launched a project to protect the European Commission, aimed at counteracting misinformation and propaganda. The analytics of the Institute check the facts of the Institute with the company "Lacmus". And last year alone, the media appliances have lambille as a millionth audience.

In addition, together with the French company, scientists conduct the research of the Hungarians through interviewing and monitoring social networks, as well as conducting a survey study to help people distinguish true news of fakes.

And when you put a person in the role of an expert, then then This method works effectively. We saw good results after this study, ”the scientist said.

According to him, at the beginning of a full -scale invasion of the Hungarians condemned the Russian and supported Ukrainians. But after the general elections in April, on which Victor Orban was conquered, the Narrative of Peace became dominant in Hungary's political discourse, which influenced the pro -government voters. According to Kreko, "the Ceresult of the influence of the media system built by the Orban government and which is very efficient."

“There is now a media system in Hungary with more than 500 organizations, and many of them are controlled by the government. And as a result of the effectiveness of this media, we will come to the fact that in Hungary public opinion is not the cause of political decisions, but will be their result, ”the expert said.

It was reported earlier [Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siyarthoto Celected US Ambassador to Hungary David Presman in the propaganda of war.](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3705472-glava-mzs-ugorsini-poskandaliv-z-poslom-ssa-zvinuvativsi-jogo-v-propagandi-vijni.html)In April, in the Hungarian Parliament, supporters of the ruling party "Fidesz" were not voted in favor of a document that supports the seizure and transfer of President of RFVvolodimir Putin by the International Criminal Court if he came to Dorhaw.

In late February, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced a number of controversial narratives about the war of Russia with anti-Ukraine at the opening of the next year. In particular, he stated that the war is "bad for Ukrainians, Russians, Hungarian, for Europe, and more and more obvious that it is bad for the whole world", but the Hungarians believe that it should be kept as far away from it.

“We are trying to combine the right and [journalism] together in Reckoning Project together(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zurnalist). These are not the two professions that are not generally working together. But in this way we can move from information to justice, from truth to justice. It's not easy when you tell you truth and wait for it to work, which is when you bring the information to the information protection structures to take appropriate measures, ”the pro -Memorials stressed.

This is our innovation and we see that it works, ”Pomerantsev added.

Five EU diplomats have told the publication that after the predominant self -fight against Russian sanctions, Budapest now receives support from the part.

EU countries are currently discussing their 11th package [sanctions](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-sankcii)Against Russia after the start of the full -scale invasion of Moscow into Ukraine more than a year ago.

While the 10 previous sanctions packages were focused on measures aimed at devastating Vladimir Putin's combat treasures, Brusselshoche is now impossible to bypass the previously imposed sanctions.

Hungary and Greece want some of their companies to be taken from the sanction registration before they agree to approve a new EU sanctions package.

These countries use a package of sanctions as a political lever to exclude the company from the sanction list.

According to four diplomats, at the meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, there was a discussion on Wednesday - Athens opposed the proposals to prevent the trials.

"Greece again stated that if there are specific evidence of a violation of sanctions, they must be brought to the attention of interested Member States at a technical level so that it is duly investigated and then properly consumed," the EU representative said. He added that according to the Ukrainian "Black List" Greek companies consider international sponsors of war, although the Avons do not violate restrictive measures against Russia.

Another EU diplomat said that although they sympathize with Greece's positions, "the question is how much it is harmful [their economy], and Greece will say that it is very harmful. Of course, we want the next package of sanctions. "The head of the Eurovodes Josep Borrel has already promised to eliminate disputes in the Ukrainian list. Two diplomats said that he should now work with the Ukrainian side on the decision.

It is vital to strengthen military capabilities by means of modernization, innovation and, most importantly, on the organization of coordinated multinational purchases together with collective logistical support.

The combination of resources and experience allows you to optimize the costs of the Defense States, to increase efficiency and, ultimately, to strengthen NATO's capacity to shorten and defense.

As a positive example of this approach related to a proven support mechanism, there are examples of a multinational agreement created at the initiative of two or more NATO countries that wish to organize a regular activity in procurement, support and maintenance.

It also allows you to efficiently combine intellectual capital, encourage the exchange of knowledge and remain Vavagard of technological achievements. This is especially relevant in the context of new agents, such as cyber, hybrid war, autonomy and artificial intelligence.In addition, the Last NATO Parliamentary Assembly has become an important platform for awareness of the Alliance of Multinational Procurement and Logistics Alliance, especially in the context of discussing a tassel on the Alliance's Security Decision.

Yes, last day there were only 2 combatants. For comparison, during the defense of Bakhmut there were days when such clashes occurred 40-50 and more. Instead, the firing activity of the enemy is not diminishing, and it imposes the positions of our troops from different types of weapons.

- Yes, last day the enemy beat up various calibers 465 times, there were 2 aircraft, - said Sergey Cherevaty. - During the battles 54 occupied was destroyed, 84 were injured. Our defenders also destroyed one reactive system of BM-21 Grad, 3 guns, 240 mm-tulip mortar, 3 unmanned aircraft complexes and 2 ammunition.

-I met the war side by side with the staff of the Main Directorate of Intelligence National Guards,-the general recalls. - We went to meet the enemy and did possible and impossible so that it does not enter the capital.

According to Vasyl Malyuk, this happened in the first two days after the beginning of the Russian invasion, and then he had to return to Kiev, to abuse and to arrange work.

-In those days there was a lot of such a Brownian movement, and it was necessary to do so that everything would work harmoniously, like an orchestra,-explains Major General.

As a result of instantaneous measures, the capital was divided into several feasters, and each of them worked operational and investigative groups, which were composed of employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, as well as NABU and special forces. Law enforcement officers responded to any threats, instantly leaving into places.

And the SBU chairman says that in those threatening for the Ukrainian capital, the Dainets of February 2022 was in the defense of ancient Kiev literally, even civilian citizens.

- We cannot in any way offset the role of even ordinary civilians, - emphasizes the general. -At that time, on February 24, when we drove the enemy, and in one of the military units, already under the blow of the helicopter-52, managed to pick up weapons and means of damage, the civilians were civil at the side!And I remembered some of them. There was one of one kind of person, who literally ran out of the house in the traps and the traffic suit, to bring a machine gun to his hands and protect the nanny Ukraine!At that time, every Ukrainian made his choice. So we stood.

In a few days, on February 28, Vasyl Malyuk was appointed President of Ukraine by the Deputy Chairman of the SBU. Returning from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Homogeneous Security Service, the officer first took up the creation of a special unit to fulfill the most important tasks in the rear of the enemy on the territories temporarily seized by the Russian horde.At that time, the fighters of the newly formed special unit operated on the border of the Kiev Tyazhimir regions, performing the most important task at that time - the reconstruction of the enemy's logistics paths. It also includes partisan-agent forces. Special forces, guerrillas and agents in the rear of the enemy conducted a lot of special measures, which significantly weakened the enemy. So, among other things, then the fighters of "Bunnik" managed to even destroy the rear office of the Russian armada, which was blown deep into the country. Subsequently, according to Vasily the baby, the experience gained then was successfully implemented in the territory of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhya regions.

-It was in this connection that I was on business trips in these regions,-adds Major General Vasyl Malyuk.

The document emphasizes that now nothing can replace Ukraine's membership in NATO - "no special formats or temporary security".

The Kiev Security Forum emphasizes the need to quickly move to the excavation and hopes that the NATO summit in Vilnius will be a turning point for Ukraine's membership in the Alliance.

The document calls for the Allies to make a political decision to propose to Ukraine membership and start negotiations on admission. In addition, start negotiations within the Alliance on providing Ukraine with guarantees similar to the collective defense guarantees of Article 5 for the period before NATO accession.

"Without unambiguous clarity in the issue of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance, we are at risk of maintaining an endless war in Europe, and the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO instead of becoming a fundamental element of the new European European Architectural Security, will again become the subject of trading during political negotiations."

** _The forum partners are the Atlantic Council, the NATO Information and Documentation Center, the National Democratic Institute, the Ukrainian Women's Congress, the Ebert Farm, the Euro -Atlantic Course.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-27T76-00-00-04-00/img_20230527_140849.jpg)If Russia wins the war against Ukraine, it will inspire China to declare antiqutorial claims to Japan, India, Vietnam and other countries. It is a common situation not only in Asia but also in Europe. The loss of Russia in this will enhance the dependence of the Russian Federation on China.

This opinion during the 15th Annual Kyiv Security Forum expressed the older researcher asia Society Policy Institute in New Dely Dr. Ch. Radja Mogan.

- It is obvious to us that what is happening in Ukraine has an impact on the situation of vases. Europeans broke out in views with China, trying to restrain Russia. This is a terrible problem, because we want to see the adherence to the support of sovereignty and territorial integrity, so that Europe can turn to the issue of widespread security in the world, - said Mogan.

He also stated, although India did not clearly condemn Russian aggression, his country appreciates territorial independence, inviolability and sovereignty and weighs their fundamental issues.

According to the expert, this situation is complicated by the fact that India has a very developed defense relationship with Moscow, and these relationships are important for overcoming aggression from China, which has territorial claims to India.

Raja Mogan wished Ukraine victory and preservation of historical sovereignty, as it "will help restrain Chinese expansion."

In an interview with Dmitry Komarov, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine Major General Vasylmalyuk said that last year the special service had already discovered more than 300 Russian agents. But there are nuances, says the head of the SBU.

- It should be understood that a hostile agent is not always a person in the shades of the defendants, - explains the general. - At a certain stage, if it is exposed to us to "overwhelm it" - sorry for such an operational slang - it is referred to - and subsequently because of it and misinforming the eighger, and influenced it, and received some data from it, then we make it on the other. And there are those who receive from 13 to 15 years of imprisonment - this, on average, now the terms of prison give the war 111, that is - state betrayal.

According to the SBU chairman, agents are detained, so to speak, different caliber. From ordinary collectors of information on the dislocation of Ukrainian military parts and units - to top, such as Medvedchuk.

-If we mentioned this person, we should understand that Medvedchuk worked side by side with the 5th FSB Service of the Russian Federation,-Vasily Malyuk continues. - This is the service that works in Ukraine. She did this all the time, it is her direct work. There was even such a plan called "Ray" - and in the case file it was reflected - where Medvedchuk even made adjustments to how to work and work in Ukraine. It is about their deep agent prohibition, the further creation of occupation regimes in the territory of Ukraine, etc.

The general adds that, working on the case of Medvedchuk, the SBU staff found and many other hostile sources. In this context, one cannot but mention, in particular, a traitor who became a resident of Russian intelligence and had a call sign "Professor".

-It is a character who worked in Odessa,-says Major General Magic. “He also lived, and he was a resident, that is, he had other agents who were in other regions of Ukraine, collected information, passed it on to the Professor, and he, in turn, passed on to her.- He had with him the so -called STZ - a special technical tool, - explains General. - It was a clock equipped with a camcorder and other means. He filmed, and in the future, thanks to the information received, the enemy planned to bring rocket blows to these objects, the buildings of the VCA and the SBU.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-27T79-00-00-04-00/img_20230527_142116.jpg)One of the ways that will allow the process in the international tribunal to attract Russian President Vladimir Putin to justice for the aggression of the in Ukraine, may be the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution. Such a burden of the 15th annual Kiev Security Forum was expressed by William Taylor, Vice president of the Institute of Peace(USA), US Ambassador to Ukraine in 2006–2009.

- The question now is how to start this process and what are the options, - said Diplomat.

In his opinion, ** one of the options ** is the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution.

- This document should be produced together with the Government of Ukraine and the International Tribunal, - said William Taylor.

He noted that this "will need extraordinary efforts, but it can be made," because, as William Taylor reminded, Ukraine managed to receive 141 and even 143 member states of General Assembly.

Mr Taylor also stressed that the United States offered another mechanism of the beginning process.

- ** The second option ** are smaller groups of countries, such as European countries that would create an international tribunal.

According to the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Major-General Vasyl Malyuk, the enemy of his agents in the liberated territories were not ready for the level of professionalism of documentation that Ukrainian special services have today.

- We have already collected full volumes of materials, and they, knowing that the Russians have gone, while staying in place, - says the head of the SBU. - The former police officers and our former staff who formed their pseudo -organs of state security and pseudo -law enforcement agencies were of the middle. We managed to consult them, to declare them suspicions. Today, these persons are in custody, give shows. It is clear that someone will be involved in our other contracted games - in general, we will not tell these details.

Also, says Major General Vasyl Malyuk, we have actively documented the so-called enemy pseudo-referendum in the territories where the enemy managed to legitimize his tricolor. An interesting moment was known from the document -intercepted Security Service of Ukraine. In it, the collaborators complained to the curators from Russia that the Kherson do not support the ideas of DORF.

“The situation is very tense in settlements. Most residents are pro -Ukrainian, they are awaiting the liberation of their territory for the formation of the Armed Forces, aggressively against representatives of the Russian authorities on the ground, ”the traitors reported to their owners.

The Head of the Security Service of Ukraine shows that on the day of the so -called plegiscite, the enemy and his associates were pre -prepared data on the appearance and results of "Voting".

- They do not even understand that all this is introduced in us in the materials!- says Vasily Kid. - And all - due to the fact that the successful methods of documentation are successfully used. Including, let me note that we will have introduced our confident(Agents under cover - note. Ed.).

Talking in an interview with Dmitry Komarov about recent detentions of hostile agents, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine Major-General Vasyl Malyuk was separately on the agent network under the name "Serb", which operated in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

-It consisted of 7 people, and they worked in all possible areas: they gathered information both about the military and civilians, and including the missile shelling of Dnipropetrovsk region,-explains Major-General Miarvasil Mid.

The bold traitors acted under the guise of volunteers, identifying the information they needed from the Ukrainian military.

- Counterintelligence is a constant job, - continues the head of the SBU. - This is, as they say, the need for a needle in the haystack. Including an important element in our activity is the detection of hostile "moles" in our benches. Yes, we also have such examples. I will remember one of our "trophy" - a culinary. This is the Colonel of the SBU, who worked on the FSB of the Russian Federation and was in touch with Mr. Sivkovich Yanukovych, the runway. We have managed to fully intercourse communication channels - both collection and information.

The detention of the culinary was a loud business. After all, it was not the arrest of an ordinary employee, but the head of the SBU department in Crimea. The Colonel of the SBU, who was to comprehend the liberation of Crimea, on the contrary, was a Russian spy, transmitted secret information. His arrest became a special operation, which he was developed by the chairmanly by the President of Ukraine.

- In addition to the culinary, our ranks had other detentions, - adds the general. - For example, the head of the Kharkiv Institute of Human Resources Colonel Ryabukha. If you take extreme sales, then in Zaporizhzhya the head of one from the arince of Zaporizhzhya department, who also worked for the enemy, was detained in Zaporozhye.

Indeed, today the Security Service of Ukraine pay special attention to their own employees who are suspicious. For example, they notice that they are tiding about colleagues or investigations of resonant administrations. And then it turns out that they have connections with the power structures.

- The most important thing - that the SBU is self -purified, detects in its ranks these rats, qualitatively document, retains them and attracts them, - summarizes the baby.

In total, 220 companies and 51 individuals. These are MIC and Trusted Russian companies. Understanding the war. And the persons through whom these companies are managed.

Not all of them operate in the territory of the terrorist state, some in other countries. But global pressure will be obtained. Step by step, we collect full data for the aggression - directly or indirectly. Each such person is building as well as our Ukrainian sanctions are either already synchronized or will be synchronized with the sanctions of the free world.

When Russia began this aggression, they looked at the world there in the mirror. There was thought that all in the world were the same cynical and allegedly as despite people as the owners of Russia. But the world is different - the world helps us to protect our lives. And everyone who goes against the world will become marginal. Russia will not get anything and all. Along with those who still try to help her in terror.

We will continue our sanction steps, and there are new sanction packages in turn - even large -scale.

As a result of the week, I want to thank Japan for a new sanction package of anthabilitia. Thank you for the new security assistance from Japan. This is what really saves.

I thank Finland for a new defense package for Ukraine, this decision was also made by this week.

I thank Germany for the transfer of our country to the next party of various defense supports, which will strengthen our defense against Russian terror, including protection.
