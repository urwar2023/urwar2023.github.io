 On the evening of May 24, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that at about 5:30 armed Ukraine "made a futile attempt to attack three unmanned speed boats" the ship "Ivan Hurs". According to Russia's military collection, the intelligence vessel was fulfilled by the security of the functioning of gas pipelines "in the exclusive economic zonituretsky Republic" of 140 km northeast of the Bosphorus Strait. Evenly, it was stated that all boats were "destroyed by fire from the regular weapons of the Russian ship", which allegedly confirmed a video with the defeat of one delay.
But in a day, probably enjoying the unreasonable triumph of the enemy, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine demonstrated Video "Romantic Meeting" of our surface drone with a reconnaissance ship.
“When the Russian reconnaissance ship" Ivan Hurs "met the Ukrainian non -infantry. Indeed, the perfect couple!”, - accompanied by Mow such signature.
 
At our request for the combat capabilities of Ivan Hursa and its importance for the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, the Armyinform readers were told by the Head of the Department and Navy of the National Defense University of Ukraine named after Ivanachernyakhovsky captain Stepan Yakimak.
Ivan Hurs reconnaissance ship can be in an autonomous supply for more than a month, so it has for a long time to identify our strengths at sea and the scienceshore, listened to the Navy radar stations, as well as our retortal defense, etc.
According to the Head of the Department of the Navy of the National University of Defense of Ukraine, Ivan Hurs reconnaissance operated in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, from the Danube Girle line to Cape Sarich in the Crimea-an area that the Russian Federation declared after the invasion. And this ship depended on 40-60 percent of the success of the goals in our forces in the fighting area.
In addition to monitoring our forces, judging from the place of attack on the Bilyabosphorus ship, he could monitor the activity of Romania, Turkey and other countries in the Black Sea, as well as civilian navigation.
As for the attack on Ivan Hursa, according to Stepan Yakimak, it is not Moglas to serious resistance, because reconnaissance ships have lightwear and usually perform their tasks in safe areas. But avoiding the reach of our "Neptune", the Russians were miscalculated.

No image from above: 1)the frame of the explosion of our surface drone; 2)the personnel of the other drone to the Russian ship. 
-By the way, I emphasize that Ivan Hurs is a legitimate goal for our forces, where Vinne is, because it is a ship of the Black Sea Fleet,-says a naval expert. - According to international law, we should only guarantee the safety of more vessels that can be near it during the attack.
Stepan Vladimirovich explains that the Russians try to cover themselves with the term "exclusive economic zone" of Turkey, but the stay in it does not protect the ship from the attack, because they are waters called the "open sea", that is, an actor outside the territorial seas of state Actions would really be illegal.
As for the damage that the Russian ship could theoretically suffer, judging by the scattered videos, Stepan Yakimak believes that they can be significant: the power of the explosion of the destroyed boat plus the impact of another drone is predicted by the vessel.
In addition, about the fact that could be seriously damaged by both valov drives(tagvins)They also say data of the international traffic information system of vessels, which shows the movement in real time. According to Stepan Yakimak, this global -system showed about 0.8 nodes after the attack.
The expert notes that with the estimated mass of explosives of 50-70 kilograms, punching directly into board the ship can create a hole with a diameter of about a meter. If they have a struggle for the vastability of the vessel, then the crew could somehow seize the feed compartment and get to the area of repair base.

He warned that the Ukrainian government "has no right to make a mistake" in this decision, since it is a "historical opportunity" that "we cannot lose".
During the interview, Danilov also confirmed that some forces of mercenaries Wagner were departed from Bakhmut. He reported their regrouping in three other places and stressed that "this does not mean that they would stop fighting with carriers."

"Bakhmut is our land, our territory, and we must protect it," said it added, "If we start leaving every settlement, it can bring to our western border, as Putin wanted from the first days of the war."

It was reported earlier Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siyarthoto Celected US Ambassador to Hungary David Presman in the propaganda of war. In April, in the Hungarian Parliament, supporters of the ruling party "Fidesz" were not voted in favor of a document that supports the seizure and transfer of President of RFVvolodimir Putin by the International Criminal Court if he came to Dorhaw.
In late February, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced a number of controversial narratives about the war of Russia with anti-Ukraine at the opening of the next year. In particular, he stated that the war is "bad for Ukrainians, Russians, Hungarian, for Europe, and more and more obvious that it is bad for the whole world", but the Hungarians believe that it should be kept as far away from it.

According to Vasyl Malyuk, this happened in the first two days after the beginning of the Russian invasion, and then he had to return to Kiev, to abuse and to arrange work.
-In those days there was a lot of such a Brownian movement, and it was necessary to do so that everything would work harmoniously, like an orchestra,-explains Major General.
As a result of instantaneous measures, the capital was divided into several feasters, and each of them worked operational and investigative groups, which were composed of employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, as well as NABU and special forces. Law enforcement officers responded to any threats, instantly leaving into places.
And the SBU chairman says that in those threatening for the Ukrainian capital, the Dainets of February 2022 was in the defense of ancient Kiev literally, even civilian citizens.
In a few days, on February 28, Vasyl Malyuk was appointed President of Ukraine by the Deputy Chairman of the SBU.

So, among other things, then the fighters of "Bunnik" managed to even destroy the rear office of the Russian armada, which was blown deep into the country. Subsequently, according to Vasily the baby, the experience gained then was successfully implemented in the territory of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhya regions.

The North Atlantic Alliance in the future summit in Vilnius has a political decision - to offer Ukraine membership in NATO and start negotiating entry.
About this it is referred in a complex positional document NATO Fighting Forum, which was presented during the 15th annual CBF.
The document states that "there was a lack of political will on both sides for many years."
“Instead of adopting Ukraine - a historical step that would provide common security and stopped the growing geopolitical and military ambitions of Russia - multi -political leaders have chosen to postpone and leave such a perspective in the future. This turned out to be a tragic mistake, ” - said the efficiency.
Its authors state that the war has changed everything: "The national resistance of Ukraine opposite Russia's aggression has made a real breakthrough in the Alliance's security thinking.
The document emphasizes that now nothing can replace Ukraine's membership in NATO - "no special formats or temporary security".
The Kiev Security Forum emphasizes the need to quickly move to the excavation and hopes that the NATO summit in Vilnius will be a turning point for Ukraine's membership in the Alliance.
The document calls for the Allies to make a political decision to propose to Ukraine membership and start negotiations on admission. In addition, start negotiations within the Alliance on providing Ukraine with guarantees similar to the collective defense guarantees of Article 5 for the period before NATO accession.
"Without unambiguous clarity in the issue of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance, we are at risk of maintaining an endless war in Europe, and the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO instead of becoming a fundamental element of the new European European Architectural Security, will again become the subject of trading during political negotiations."

 If Russia wins the war against Ukraine, it will inspire China to declare antiqutorial claims to Japan, India, Vietnam and other countries. It is a common situation not only in Asia but also in Europe. The loss of Russia in this will enhance the dependence of the Russian Federation on China.
This opinion during the 15th Annual Kyiv Security Forum expressed the older researcher asia Society Policy Institute in New Dely Dr. Ch. Radja Mogan.
He also stated, although India did not clearly condemn Russian aggression, his country appreciates territorial independence, inviolability and sovereignty and weighs their fundamental issues.
According to the expert, this situation is complicated by the fact that India has a very developed defense relationship with Moscow, and these relationships are important for overcoming aggression from China, which has territorial claims to India.
Raja Mogan wished Ukraine victory and preservation of historical sovereignty, as it "will help restrain Chinese expansion."

She did this all the time, it is her direct work. There was even such a plan called "Ray" - and in the case file it was reflected - where Medvedchuk even made adjustments to how to work and work in Ukraine. It is about their deep agent prohibition, the further creation of occupation regimes in the territory of Ukraine, etc.
The general adds that, working on the case of Medvedchuk, the SBU staff found and many other hostile sources. In this context, one cannot but mention, in particular, a traitor who became a resident of Russian intelligence and had a call sign "Professor".
-It is a character who worked in Odessa,-says Major General Magic. “He also lived, and he was a resident, that is, he had other agents who were in other regions of Ukraine, collected information, passed it on to the Professor, and he, in turn, passed on to her.- He had with him the so -called STZ - a special technical tool, - explains General. - It was a clock equipped with a camcorder and other means. He filmed, and in the future, thanks to the information received, the enemy planned to bring rocket blows to these objects, the buildings of the VCA and the SBU.

Such a burden of the 15th annual Kiev Security Forum was expressed by William Taylor, Vice president of the Institute of Peace(USA), US Ambassador to Ukraine in 2006–2009.

He noted that this "will need extraordinary efforts, but it can be made," because, as William Taylor reminded, Ukraine managed to receive 141 and even 143 member states of General Assembly.
Mr Taylor also stressed that the United States offered another mechanism of the beginning process.
The third option Taylor named the idea of consideration of Putin's claim in one of third countries, such as European, in the jurisdiction of Jeslochin to commit the act of aggression.
Separately, the exhibit also spoke about the prospects of NATO summit for Ukraine, which will take place in Vilnius.
We will remind, earlier, the office of the President of Ukraine stated that Ukraine can be created before the creation of an international special tribunal for management for the next year and a half for the next year, provided
