![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-27T81-00-00-04-00/golovna-50.jpg)** _ The Ukrainian army is increasingly moving away from outdated Soviet management methods, mastering the latest domestic developments. Remember, for example, the introduction of a protected combat system of management of the tactical link "Nettle", without which no combat unit now does? Now the Armed Forces have every chance of weaponing another unique development _ ** _— ** an automated and remote control system of artillery intelligence _barak_, which cannot be detected by any technical means. And this is because it gives a clear "tight" of the coordinates of the work of even a large caliber -gun at a distance of 12 km, and mortars and artillery ** —_ ** _ up to 30 km.

Correspondent [Armyinform](https://armyinform.com.ua/)He had a conversation about this development with the chief of artillery of one of the individual infantry brigades that nowadays the invaders in the Donetsk direction. Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Podvysotsky Testatta helps to improve the truly unique invention of his author and his large team of like -minded people for almost a year. According to him, the development is already practical to wide use in the Armed Forces.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-27T81-00-00-04-00/1-88.jpg)*!

- This development appeared in us last summer, after the beginning of the Great War. In her minds, we needed to have the most effective means of counteracting the occupiers, based on the correlation of our forces and means. What we did not meet us for many reasons, including the moral and physical obsolescence of the Soviet model systems. It is a very painful topic for artillery. Therefore, when we met the Odessa inventor scientist, who was already related to the development of acoustic intelligence systems, we have started active cooperation.

Honestly, I did not believe at first that _barak_ would work effectively when a team of like -minded people and colleagues of the inventor with some thamphon and microphones came to the front. But we urgently needed some new tool of artillery intelligence, first of all, for an effective counter -battery fight against the enemy. Therefore, we joined their work, and in the summer of Odessa we were given to us for testing a pilot version of the complex _barak_.

- ** What _bar_ _k_ is self -and physically? **

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-27T81-00-00-04-00/bez-ymeny-koe1.jpg)The first version of the barracks

But at the moment we have reached the next. Now we are filled with accurate coordinating articles and individual enemy guns at distances of up to 30 kilometers. We have the most accurate data if we fire from distances of U18-24 kilometers. We spend no more than five seconds on "sampling". After that, with the help of _barak_ operators, we compare our data with the data of our "birds", which are almost constantly spreading in the sky and are with operators_Barak_ on direct communication online, information from tactical intelligence, we get the same coordinates of goals.

- ** Mr. Vitaliy, what is this complex physically? **

- It is easy to work, does not require large human or material costs. Physically, it is eight, and, if necessary, small, small modules of directional action, which are located according to certain schemes of tacked, for several kilometers. They work around the clock, independently of each other, having every energy supply for 5-7 days. Software is constantly being improved taking into account various factors that fall to the work of the complex. It is the intensity and massness of the work of the gate -artillery, each barrel of which _barak_ should be astonished, the time of day, the temperature environment, etc. The latest updates that have made for _barak_ Odessa are an opportunity to shine the spans of Iranian "Shahmed", as well as a module or system -module when the sounds of outputs are fuzzy. Bazazvis for determining goals is constantly updated, up to calibers less than 82 millimeters. By the way, the latest version of the complex _barak_ is already actively used directly on the Odessa coast.

- ** Modules can be controlled remotely? **

- So. If the operator receives from the air intelligence data about the work of the artillery -protector that leads fire on us, and _barak_ it "does not see" at all, Vinidststentally makes a restart of a module, seeks and changes frequency -determination, etc. The operator also has the opportunity to process the obtained data with software algorithms, which, according to the expert, will determine the most precise coordinates of the goals. The data obtained shall be transmitted to the senior boss, who already enforce the expediency or possibility of using the fire in response.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-27T81-00-00-04-00/foto-3-19.jpg)

- As far as I know, there are no world analogues of the world at all. At least by dimensions, survivability, mobility, ease of application and service, width of the observation strip and accuracy during the coverage of a total number of goals. And most importantly - it has a passive effect, it is planned to detect any technical means. He is not capable of influencing the enemy radio struggle. Moreover, it is planted to destroy it physically, such as acoustic intelligence station for a false or armored database. Try to find in the fields and forestry in a few kilometers eight dug and masked under the locality or soils of the case with a suitcase-diploma!Even if the number of them will be accidentally destroyed or failed, the complex will act. The module does not give any radiation, even thermal, and how operators receive information from them - the "secret of the firm".

- ** How long does the algorithm take: "Severe" Coordinates goals - data transfer - a decision - a fire in response? **

- Five seconds to determine coordinates, 30 seconds for processing and transferring data to an artillery group, a few minutes to make a decision to impress the target and set the fire task of the artillery unit, and the first shot.

- ** The results are satisfactory? **

- More than. In addition to the direct hits, which are constantly in place, we are even naximal shooting distances for errors in determining the coordinates of 50 meters, we can, say, calculations of enemy guns and the guns of the gun-fugitive projectile, fragments of which are flew in a radius of 200 meters. But we or the means of impression of the higher command have a mobile opportunity to suppress the work of the enemy's art to support the action of our possessive.

- ** Vitaliy Ivanovich, in your opinion, is it capable of _barak_ to take place in the artillery units of our troo

- The definition of the author sounds as follows: "The centralized multi -moderate system of the reconnaissance of the passive principle." And _barak_ is really an abbreviation.

- ** We can see the work of operators _barak _? **

- So. A officer from the Fire Support Department of the brigade, who is engaged in this direction, will now be coming behind you. You will see the command of operators, which alternates on the complex and shifting, serves modules, exhibits them according to the schemes and replaces the power supply ...

… We talk to the head of the department, the senior operator of complex -reconnaissance Yaroslav.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-27T81-00-00-04-00/6-50.jpg)- ** Yaroslav, how much do you think is effective _barak _? **

- In terms of accuracy of determining the coordinates of shooting guns or reactive systems of volley fire, it is extremely accurate at distances somewhere in 25 kilometers, and gives a small error at the maximum distance of determining the targets of 30 kilometers. Moreover, we already clearly shine the work not only of mortar calibers, but also anti -aircraft installations and even large caliber machine guns 10-12 thousand meters.

- ** Does the quality of work depend on weather conditions or other factors? **

- We have six methods of information processing. Four of them take into account the meteodans, which we enter into the program. Each module gives out the results of the "seam" coordinates autonomously. They are combined in a special plate, after which we receive data on the direction of conducting fire - that is, where the orcs are firing, the distance to their firearms, and in the end - their current coordinates. Then we compare the result with the data of the subdivision, with which we are on online communication, and at night additional with information of the respective points at the leading positions. Then we give out the most exact result where it is necessary.

- ** How protected in all senses the modules themselves? **- ** modules give failures? **

- Sometimes. But they are able to restart either independently or remotely with the help of operators. By the way, remote control is a single plus _barak_. There were several cases where the enemy's work was recorded at any of the directions of the speech, and our complex did not hear it. We remotely reconciled the work of several modules into a different frequency range quickly fell out the enemy. Further, our arta was taken for the cause.

- ** You know about the results of her work? **

- I know, but I will not voice. When the older command expresses gratitude to us, it means that we and our artillery worked perfectly.

- ** Your impression of _barak _? **

- He is incredible!

** P ** **. ** ** S ** ** **. ** _Sond the interview, the author contacted Odessa, namely, and invented _barak_(He has now asked for his name). За його словами, цей комплекс вже ефективно працює не тільки наДонецькому напрямку, але й уздовж узбережжя Чорного моря, в акваторії Очакова,у багатьох бойових бригадах на півдні України. Завдяки _БАРАК_ вони посилиликонтрбатарейну боротьбу з орками та вже навчилися виявляти й знищуватиіранські «Шахеди». Команда однодумців у винахідника велика, наразі вона працюєна волонтерських засадах. Про стовідсоткову готовність комплексу до серійноговиробництва, зі слів винахідника, можна буде говорити лише післядержвипробувань та прийняття його на озброєння в ЗСУ._

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-28T-13-11-00-03-00/630_360_1673967567-899.jpg)The European Commission proposes to introduce an electronic euro, while maintaining cash coins and banknotes.

Such proposals are published on the European Commission's website, Ukrinform reports.

"The European Commission today has released two proposals that have to provide citizens and businesses to make payments by banknotes and coins of Vevrozon, as well as to create framework conditions for a possible introduction of a new digit form of the euro, which the European central bank can create to the intestinal bank," .

It is noted in the euro area and beyond the survey that about 60% of respondents would like to maintain cash use. At the same time, more and more people in the EU make electronic payments accustomed to bank cards or payment applications, which became particularly comprehensive during the Covid-19 pandemic .

In some EU countries, problems have already begun to emerge with restricted people's access to cash due to the reduction of the number of ATMs and bank offices. National governments should be addressed by national governments.

The second regulatory proposal involves providing citizens to [EU](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz)and European business can make payments using euro electronic currency, a wide circulation, will be a cheap, reliable and stable payment unit for cash. Such a step should strengthen the position of the euro as an international payment unit and strengthen the monetary sovereignty of the EU. The introduction of electronic currency of the euro is also important in view of the development of the cryptocurrency market.

For the convenience of using a digital euro, it is proposed to provide the ability to pay "from the device to the device", even with the absence of pre -ternet access, with the proper level of reliability of payments and protection of personal data.

This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba, on the OSCE Presidential Conference on Security Issues, reports Ukrinform with a reference to [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mfa.gov.ua/news/dmitro-kuleba-poperediv-obsye-pro-riziki-vchinennya-rosiyeyu-teraktu-na-zaes).

“Today, Russia is threatening Ukraine and the entire OSCE space of the Radiation Ministry at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Whatever the Russian propaganda, Russia, and only Russia has today has motivation and means for it to commit an incident to the ZPP, ”the minister said.

He stressed that, having occupied the station and turning it into a military base, Russia uses the NPP as a nuclear blackmail tool.

"I do not know what else to happen for the OSCE States Parties to recognize the obvious: Russia is not a place at this table," the head of Ukrainian diplomacy emphasized.

This terrorist act has brought the Russian crimes to a new stage, as a real scale of its consequences for people and the environment can only be estimated later.

The Minister expressed gratitude to the chairman of Northern Macedonia for the firm position of protecting the principles of the OSCE in the conditions of full -scale aggression of Russia anti -Ukraine.

“Russia's impunity cannot be tolerated, the illegal detention of employees [OSCE](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obse), theft is more than 70 vehicles. There can be no discussion with a country whose president is in search of the ISS for the military crime of abduction of Ukrainian children. There can be no civilized dialogue with a country that causes intense blowers and drones in densely populated residential areas, resorts to massives, torture, rape and intimidation of civilians. There can be no understanding of an understanding with an aggressor who is trying to destroy Ukrainian and national identity, ”Kuleba emphasized.*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3728893-v-ukraini-projdut-navcanna-z-podolanna-naslidkiv-mozlivoi-avarii-na-zaes.html)The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called on the OSCE to actively participate in the embodiment of the formula of peace.

“We live in the time of challenges when discussions without pragmatic decisions are no longer working. If we want to preserve the OSCE and our collective devotion to the principles of the Helsinki final act, we need to find a way to suspend Russia in the OSCE, ”the minister summed up.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-28T14-00-00-04-00/27.06.23_ppo-nato.png)The large -scale invasion of the Russian army into Ukraine has once again renovated that today a reliable protection of the country requires an exceptional efficiency system of air defense. Events in Ukraine are forced to improve the integrated system of reference and missile defense of NATO on the North Atlantic Alliance(IAMD).

Breaking Defense коротко описує загальні принципи роботи системи. Отже,загрози з повітря спочатку виявляють за допомогою датчиків, які здатнівиявляти пуски ракет чи зліт літаків через лічені хвилини після того, як цевідбулося, — спостереження ведеться як з землі, так і з моря, повітря танавіть за допомогою космічних супутників. Усі дані передаються на командніпункти НАТО, як-от Об’єднані центри повітряних операцій (Caoc)in Wedem(Germany)and Torrehoni(Spain). Потім відповідні структури можутьвизначити найкращий спосіб боротьби із загрозою.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-28T14-00-00-04-00/27.06.23_ppo-nato_3-1.jpg)Tasks can perform high-ranging missile defense systems, such as US defense system at high altitude(THAAD)or French missiles Sol-Air Moyenne Portée/Terrestre(SAMP/T)small and average. NATO can also use anti -rocket deficiency warships or fighters to effectively counteract threats.

Breaking Defense emphasizes that in recent years, the Alliance has had to deal with new threats, such as unmanned devices and hypersonic rockets. Therefore, NATO is now working hard on tactics and technologies for counteracting these. For example, in the year, Germany proposed a new initiative to the creation of a joint missile and prototypical defense system, called the "European Sky Shield", NATO. And as they set out in Berlin and Brussels, this security program is primarily aimed at increasing the security of NATO countries from air threats and provides even more close and effective integration of air and missing systems of allies into a single complex.

About it in your [appeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd6j46Mvcl8)At the end of the 490th day of the war, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, Ukrinform reports.

** _ Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!_ **

First of all - about yesterday's Russian blow to Kramatorsk. Work on the site of the terrorist attack continued this. Unfortunately, the death toll increased. My muddy native. More than 60 people were injured and injured.

Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, together with the police special forces, had a person who adjusts this blow to terrorists. Just on the cafe of Uzramatorsk, on the popular pizzeria. Damaged neighboring homes, shops, dressing. Ordinary city, ordinary life. Under the rubble can still be people.

Anyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves a naximal punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators there. Everything is clear. These are people without humanity. Everyone in the world who does not understand that it is impossible to be an accomplice of a terrorist state must respond to the entire international community. The corrector is under the article on state treason. Punishment - including lifelong. The accomplices of the terrorist state should be considered as traitors of humanity and humanity.

We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia's accomplices. They should feel that the price of their terror for them will be increased. And we will continue our global legal work so that the international instruments have worked for the punishment of all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself.

Today, in an appeal to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on the occasion of the Constitution Day, he was about justice. Internal justice is a responsibility for violation of law in Ukraine. And about the justice of communicating with the Russian-Ukrainian war is about the responsibility of the Russian war. Justice policy will be one of the basics of Ukrainian Dokrin - a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country of the year.Ukraine and all in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand on protection of justice. Justice for all whose lives were exposed to Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory of all people, all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian inhumans!

I want to report the day briefly now.

Presidents of Lithuania and Poland were a visit - Hitanas Nausede and Andrzej Duda.

A very timely and useful visit - on the eve of Vilnius. The format of negotiations is span and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, a panel, for the decision to buy and pass the NASAMS systems, it is very necessary. They discussed common political challenges - both in the region and international countries. Of course, they also talked about the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union, which we expect this year.

He met with the main master-holder of the 47th separate mechanized brigade "Magura" Valery Marcus. They talked to him about the war, about our warriors, I will have a defense.

They discussed, in particular, the accounting reform in military structures. Less paper of bureaucracy, more digitalization. They discussed the reform of the Sergeant Corps. Khorosh conversation. Thank you for the chevrons!

Today, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, I was honored to reward our soldiers and to transmit state awards to our heroes. Very emotionally, very honorable. I worship our warriors!I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine!

I congratulate everyone on the Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, everyone and every one of the state, only to multiply the will, glory and independence of Ukraine!And so will it!

I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of the Kurban Bayram holiday. We will all get peace for our country, for our countries, for our children.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-28T15-55-55-03-00/630_360_1687956672-861.jpg)The telescope of the European Southern Observatory recently took pictures, and on June 27, it published an image of nebula, which in the form is very reminiscent of the ore of cat.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/science/can-you-find-the-cat-in-this-fiery-orange-nebula).

This nebula, known as SH2-284, is an area of dense gas and dust, deforming new stars.

One particularly striking accumulation of newborn stars, called Dolidze 25, burns in the heart of the brightest nebulae area(Under the cat's nose.). Ці молоді масивні зорі наповнюють навколишній простір потужнимизоряними вітрами та інтенсивним випромінюванням, накопичуючи електрони знавколишніх хмар водню.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-28T15-55-55-03-00/1687956710-234.jpg)This ionized hydrogen gas glows with a bright orange and red colorful image in the telescope. That is why SH2-84 is similar to a red cat.

If you look closely at the star cluster, you can see pillars of more thickening gas and dust, which are strong enough so as not to be blurred with starry lights. These pillars give rise to their own clusters of bright stars.

As reported by Ukrinform, space telescope [NASA](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nasa)/Esa Hubble photographed a bright spherical cluster of NGC 6544, located in the constellation of Sagittarius.

The chairman of the company Volodymyr Kudrytsky reported this during a briefing of Stannergosystem: Risk of Disconnections and Preparation for Winter at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform.

“[Import](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-import)In the conditions of today's market, the current price-caps, which will be changed since July 1, is not possible when it is needed-in the hours of the highest consumption, when it has increased in Europe, and in Ukraine-they rest in the upper limit. Meanwhile, the lower marsh price stimulates imports at the hours when it is not needed; In Europe there will be negative prices, and we are kept on the same level. Therefore, such a price regulation is clearly incorrect, ”the head of Ukrenergo explained.

Kudrytsky expressed his hope that the level of the price-keps that set up a regulator for the wholesale market will be enough to make the volume of import.

“The effectiveness of the decision made by the regulator can be judged in July. If in July we see that finally considerable imports come to the Ukrainian energy system in such a way that they cover the deficit, it should be hundreds of MW, to say that it was effective. We will be able to check it in a few days of the jam, ”the head of the NEC summarized.

About it reports [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-66028606), reports Ukrinform.

The law adopted last year in December abolishes the South Korean tradition, which is a year at birth year(Given pre -natal development)And from January 1, it gets older a year. That is, the child, which was angered on December 31, was two years next day.

The system at which the age is calculated by subtracting the year of birth from the current one without consideration of months is also abolished.

Thus, as of June 28, 2023, a person born on June 29, 2003, was 19 years old on an international system, 20 years under the age of "calculating age" and 21 years under the system "** [Korean](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-korea)** Age ».

The incumbent President of Korea Yun Jok Yol strongly insisted on the necessary changes during the election campaign. According to him, traditional methods of age calculations have led to "unnecessary social and economic expenditures". For example, there were disputes over insurance payments and determination of the right to participate in state assistance programs.

Japan adopted the International Standard for Calculating Age in 1950, and Northern Korea followed this example in the 1980s.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-28T18-00-00-04-00/12-19.jpg)The state, the public and the international community should consolidate the efforts to reflect all Ukrainian prisoners from the Russian captivity, where they are undergoing physical and mental torture. One of the tools for the release of military and civilian hostages is wide publicity. Eugene Glinyanazaszasna was recently about the guarantee of the NGO "Voyatsky Devil" during the event dedicated to the International Day for the support of torture.

According to Eugene Glynyana, there are no precise figures of prisoners of Ukrainian, alpine and human rights organizations operate data on 10 thousand Ukrainian military and 27 thousand civilian Ukrainians, which are now being held by the Urosian captivity, as well as about 19.5 thousand Ukrainian children were illegally brought to the territory of the Russian Federation. There are 42 locations where the Russians are kept by Ukrainian.

- We united in October 2022, we are relatives of the military servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine from the city of Mariupol. We united to fight for our relatives, because as if the father and wives are struggling, unfortunately, no one else is fighting. Now we say that the Nasiiride is not only physical and mental torture, but also famine torture, - says Yevgeny Glinyan, whose brother is being held in Russian captivity.

According to a study of the ZMINA Human Rights Center, 63 % of the released Ukrainian people were tortured by electric current, 81 % were beating, 70 % were famine.

- Another kind of torture is the lack of connection with relatives, although according to the Convention, a prisoner of war is entitled to correspondence. But such communication is forbidden. We have repeatedly sent letters to the Brotherhood Committee of the Red Cross, but unfortunately, we did not support the answers from it. I think the letters also did not reach the addressee, - said Yevgeniaglynyana.

According to her, the Russians hide Ukrainian prisoners of war and prevent the places of their maintenance of representatives of the International Committee of the Chervonohrostta, who has the right to attend the places of maintenance of prisoners of war and to check the conditions of their maintenance.Yevgeny Glinyana noted that the problem of compliance with the international humanitarian law, which was demonstrated by Russia's war against Ukraine, is a problem not only in Ukraine, but of the whole civilized world. Therefore, the slogan "human life - the highest value" should not remain only the slogan.

- The efforts of Ukrainians should be aimed at changing, supplemented and editing the Geneva Convention and the UN Convention against torture - in order for these values, rules and norms to be implemented, - Yevgeniaglyinyan emphasized.

However, in [](https://zsro.ru/upload/files/download/Otchet_gubernator_RO2022.pdf)[Report on Activity](https://zsro.ru/upload/files/download/Otchet_gubernator_RO2022.pdf)The Government of 2022 states that 1148 children who arrived "without legal representatives from the territory of Donbass and Ukraine" were transmitted under the previous guardianship.

The wording is unclear what status in these children, how many of them are overwhelmed by relatives, and how many orphans. It is also unknown whether allivons remain in Russian families, as the temporary guardian is appointed from half a year to eight months. If during this time it disforms constant care, its action stops.

This is twice less than the assertion of the Rostov region. Most likely, the rest of the children went to other regions.

The publication notes that it is difficult to track the fate of each child of more than a thousand, and the open sources have a location of 290 children from Ukraine in 23 regions of Russia.

Most of all - 47 children - are in the Novosibirsk region. At least 30 children were found in the families of the Moscow region, 25 in Kaluga, 24-University, another 21 deported child lives in the families of Yamalo-Nenetsky Automous District, 20-in Leningrad region. 20 children are taken out to the rest of the regions.** Read also: ** [Russians want to take out about 300 ** children ** from Ukraine to Chuvashia - the National Center(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3728595-rosiani-hocut-vivezti-blizko-300-ditej-iz-ukraini-do-cuvasii-nacsprotiv.html)The publication notes that all these children were probably given to Russian families in October 2022. Since November, news about the mass transmission of children stopped appearing in the care, only in the media there were only cases.

As reported by Ukrinform, on March 17 this year, the International Criminal Court of UgaAaz issued warrants for the arrest of Mary of Lviv -Belova and Vladimir Putin in connection with military crimes - deportation and illegal movement of the population, including children from the occupied territory of Ukraine.

This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba, on the OSCE Presidential Conference on Security Issues, reports Ukrinform with a reference to [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://mfa.gov.ua/news/dmitro-kuleba-poperediv-obsye-pro-riziki-vchinennya-rosiyeyu-teraktu-na-zaes).

“Today, Russia is threatening Ukraine and the entire OSCE space of the Radiation Ministry at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Whatever the Russian propaganda, Russia, and only Russia has today has motivation and means for it to commit an incident to the ZPP, ”the minister said.

He stressed that, having occupied the station and turning it into a military base, Russia uses the NPP as a nuclear blackmail tool.

"I do not know what else to happen for the OSCE States Parties to recognize the obvious: Russia is not a place at this table," the head of Ukrainian diplomacy emphasized.

The Minister expressed gratitude to the chairman of Northern Macedonia for the firm position of protecting the principles of the OSCE in the conditions of full -scale aggression of Russia anti -Ukraine.

“Russia's impunity cannot be tolerated, the illegal detention of employees [OSCE](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obse), theft is more than 70 vehicles. There can be no discussion with a country whose president is in search of the ISS for the military crime of abduction of Ukrainian children. There can be no civilized dialogue with a country that causes intense blowers and drones in densely populated residential areas, resorts to massives, torture, rape and intimidation of civilians. There can be no understanding of an understanding with an aggressor who is trying to destroy Ukrainian and national identity, ”Kuleba emphasized.*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3728893-v-ukraini-projdut-navcanna-z-podolanna-naslidkiv-mozlivoi-avarii-na-zaes.html)The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called on the OSCE to actively participate in the embodiment of the formula of peace.

“We live in the time of challenges when discussions without pragmatic decisions are no longer working. If we want to preserve the OSCE and our collective devotion to the principles of the Helsinki final act, we need to find a way to suspend Russia in the OSCE, ”the minister summed up.

As it was reported, on March 4, 2022 the Russians occupied the ZPP.

"The appointment of Elena Duma can put a cross on ARMA," - said UTransparency International Ukraine.

According to anti -corruption, the appointment of the Duma is a large reputation risky of Ukraine and to work independent and effective activity of anti -corruption ecosystem and law enforcement agencies.

"Elena Duma has over 22 years of experience in state bodies, as well as for this time, it was very active in anti -corruption and trade union organizations, organized and participated in various rallies. The experience of Elena Duma is inconsistent with work in the field of criminal justice, as well as incompatible with the management or search of assets. And this raises doubt, " -goes in the message.

The winner's close political ties are also indicated.

"In 2019, the Duma was directly involved in the agitation for one of the candidates of the President of Ukraine and the discrediting of another applicant for this position. It is a political involvement of the winner of the ARMA chairman, which can be influenced by its work in this position."Probable business contacts with state -owned states and suspects of growth," Transparency International added.

Thus, among the public community, there are assumptions about the contacts of the Duma by the ZSEX School of the Crimean Directorate of the SBU, suspected of Olegkulinic, suspected of the State Pre -Council.

"But the largest marker, which indicates the involvement of the future agency's leader, is participation in 2019 in a joint press conference with Sam Kislin -Financial Donor Rudolf Juliana.

About it in your [appeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd6j46Mvcl8)At the end of the 490th day of the war, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, Ukrinform reports.

** _ Dear Ukrainians, Ukrainians!_ **

First of all - about yesterday's Russian blow to Kramatorsk. Work on the site of the terrorist attack continued this. Unfortunately, the death toll increased. My muddy native. More than 60 people were injured and injured.

Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, together with the police special forces, had a person who adjusts this blow to terrorists. Just on the cafe of Uzramatorsk, on the popular pizzeria. Damaged neighboring homes, shops, dressing. Ordinary city, ordinary life. Under the rubble can still be people.

Anyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves a naximal punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators there. Everything is clear. These are people without humanity. Everyone in the world who does not understand that it is impossible to be an accomplice of a terrorist state must respond to the entire international community. The corrector is under the article on state treason. Punishment - including lifelong. The accomplices of the terrorist state should be considered as traitors of humanity and humanity.

We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia's accomplices. They should feel that the price of their terror for them will be increased. And we will continue our global legal work so that the international instruments have worked for the punishment of all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself.

Today, in an appeal to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on the occasion of the Constitution Day, he was about justice. Internal justice is a responsibility for violation of law in Ukraine. And about the justice of communicating with the Russian-Ukrainian war is about the responsibility of the Russian war. Justice policy will be one of the basics of Ukrainian Dokrin - a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country of the year.Ukraine and all in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand on protection of justice. Justice for all whose lives were exposed to Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory of all people, all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian inhumans!

I want to report the day briefly now.

Presidents of Lithuania and Poland were a visit - Hitanas Nausede and Andrzej Duda.

A very timely and useful visit - on the eve of Vilnius. The format of negotiations is span and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, a panel, for the decision to buy and pass the NASAMS systems, it is very necessary. They discussed common political challenges - both in the region and international countries. Of course, they also talked about the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union, which we expect this year.

He met with the main master-holder of the 47th separate mechanized brigade "Magura" Valery Marcus. They talked to him about the war, about our warriors, I will have a defense.

They discussed, in particular, the accounting reform in military structures. Less paper of bureaucracy, more digitalization. They discussed the reform of the Sergeant Corps. Khorosh conversation. Thank you for the chevrons!

Today, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, I was honored to reward our soldiers and to transmit state awards to our heroes. Very emotionally, very honorable. I worship our warriors!I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine!

I congratulate everyone on the Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, everyone and every one of the state, only to multiply the will, glory and independence of Ukraine!And so will it!

I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of the Kurban Bayram holiday. We will all get peace for our country, for our countries, for our children.

Thank you all who are fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank everyone and everyone who is in battle, at combat posts and positions. Thank you, warriors, for new promotion first!

About it reports [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-66028606), reports Ukrinform.

The law adopted last year in December abolishes the South Korean tradition, which is a year at birth year(Given pre -natal development)And from January 1, it gets older a year. That is, the child, which was angered on December 31, was two years next day.

The system at which the age is calculated by subtracting the year of birth from the current one without consideration of months is also abolished.

Thus, as of June 28, 2023, a person born on June 29, 2003, was 19 years old on an international system, 20 years under the age of "calculating age" and 21 years under the system "** [Korean](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-korea)** Age ».

Now the system of calculating age in Korea is unified.

The incumbent President of Korea Yun Jok Yol strongly insisted on the necessary changes during the election campaign. According to him, traditional methods of age calculations have led to "unnecessary social and economic expenditures". For example, there were disputes over insurance payments and determination of the right to participate in state assistance programs.

Japan adopted the International Standard for Calculating Age in 1950, and Northern Korea followed this example in the 1980s.

"Eternal Peace" is a documentary of TSN correspondent Nellie Kowalskaya Street for Ukrainian statehood and the decisive battle of today.

The author shows the history of Ukraine's confrontation with Russia through the lens of the history of the Cathedral in Kiev.

Where exactly did the abyss come from - it is not clear. However, the creators of the documentary tape come with additional correct conclusions - that the confrontation between Ukraine with Russia has been ongoing for a century.

Last year, I would remind that the creative team of the Army Information Agency realized the crossmedtional project "30 Wars with a Zachaty neighbor", which is accessible to Uvideo, audio and printed formats.

And the account of this eternal confrontation in our favor!So now the Milnik Publishing House is preparing to print "30 Wars with a Zakati neighbor" in Pocket-Book format to distribute it to every unit of defense forces of Ukraine. The athelevatural project "Eternal Peace" only enhances the motivation during the counter -offensive, because our generation has been a historical chance to end with the absolute evil of Moscow.

російська федерація і надалі ігнорує закони та звичаї війни, використовуєтактику терору, завдає ударів, здійснює обстріли як по військових, так і поцивільних об’єктах.

Сьогодні вночі російські окупанти завдали чергового авіаційного ударуіранськими ударними БПЛА типу Shahed. Інформація щодо наслідків цієїтерористичної атаки наразі уточнюється.

Упродовж минулої доби російські загарбники завдали удару по території України.Для цього задіяли 5 крилатих ракет повітряного базування Х-22 та 2 зенітнікеровані ракети із С-300. Крім того, ворог завдав 24 авіаційні удари таздійснив 42 обстріли з реактивних систем залпового вогню. Ракети Х-22 ворогспрямував по дачному кооперативу у Кременчуцькому районі Полтавської областіта по Запоріжжю. Ракетами С-300 російські терористи вразили наповненийцивільними людьми заклад харчування в центрі міста Краматорськ та приватнийсектор населеного пункту Біленьке Донецької області. Внаслідок російськоїтерористичної атаки, на жаль, є загиблі діти та дорослі мирні люди, пораненопонад 50 цивільних людей, пошкоджено багатоквартирні та десятки приватнихжитлових будинків.

Ймовірність завдавання ракетних та авіаційних ударів по всій території Українизалишається дуже високою.

"The appointment of Elena Duma can put a cross on ARMA," - said UTransparency International Ukraine.

According to anti -corruption, the appointment of the Duma is a large reputation risky of Ukraine and to work independent and effective activity of anti -corruption ecosystem and law enforcement agencies.

"Elena Duma has over 22 years of experience in state bodies, as well as for this time, it was very active in anti -corruption and trade union organizations, organized and participated in various rallies. The experience of Elena Duma is inconsistent with work in the field of criminal justice, as well as incompatible with the management or search of assets. And this raises doubt, " -goes in the message.

The winner's close political ties are also indicated.

"In 2019, the Duma was directly involved in the agitation for one of the candidates of the President of Ukraine and the discrediting of another applicant for this position. It is a political involvement of the winner of the ARMA chairman, which can be influenced by its work in this position."Probable business contacts with state -owned states and suspects of growth," Transparency International added.

Thus, among the public community, there are assumptions about the contacts of the Duma by the ZSEX School of the Crimean Directorate of the SBU, suspected of Olegkulinic, suspected of the State Pre -Council.

The Secretary General of the United Nations in his report on children of armed conflict for 2023 considers Russia and its settings responsible for the murder of Ukrainian children, as well as for attacks at hospital and school. About it [reports](https://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/posts/pro-vklyucennya-rosiyi-do-spisku-ganbi-yak-storoni-zbroinogo-konfliktu-vidpovidalnoyi-za-seriozni-porusennya-prav-ditei)Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.

The inclusion of the Secretary General of Russia-P5 member in the annual "List of Shame" as parties of the armed conflict responsible for serious violations of children is an important notice to the aggressor state and criminals involved in the committing atrocities in relation to children: such actions are not permitted and are not worried.

The report also refers to the movement of Ukrainian children to Russia and the navigated territories with a call to Russia to act in the best interests of the child - to contribute to the reunification of the family, while guaranteeing that their citizenship is not building. This is in line with the problem of compulsory deportation of Ukrainian children in Russia - an international crime, which was in fact that the international criminal judgment was arrested for the arrest of President Putin this year.

We urge the United Nations to closely monitor Russia's actions, and as well as the measures that it pledged to take to improve the protection of Ukrainian children under its effective control.

There is currently no such progress: according to our latest estimates, in the beginning of full -scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, 493 children were killed and 1033 were injured, almost 20,000 children have been forcibly deported. These are only those cases that are listed in criminal proceedings. These figures do not include temporarily occupied territories, so real figures can be significantly high. In total, in Ukraine, law enforcement agencies are investigating more than 3,000 rays against children.

The international community should be remembered that the desire for peace can not be identified by the victim and the aggressor, since the act of aggression of Russia has led to an armed conflict and continuous commission of cruel crimes in Ukraine by its forces and settings.The Office of the Prosecutor General is working closely with the UN International International Investigation Commission on Ukraine, providing information on the forced movement of Ukrainian children and other serious violations of children's rights from September 2022. Two meetings have been carried out and one request for information was provided. crimes committed against children in the course of Russian aggression.

In Ukraine, a working group was created at the state level on interaction of the special representative of the UN Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflicts. In the course of its work, the Office of the Prosecutor General provides information on severe violations of children by Russia.

Our prosecutors are in contact with experts of the International Criminal Court. More than 40 volumes of cases of cases have been transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 30 requests for the protection of evidence, information and investigative actions have been fulfilled.

We also cooperate with the experts of the Moscow OSCE mechanism. The latest report of the Soming mechanism was dedicated to the protection of the rights of deported Ukrainian children. During its training, the OSCE experts held meetings with prosecutors who carry out procedural guidance in criminal proceedings on the deportation of children and other international crimes committed against children.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-28T91-00-00-04-00/oleksandr_pavlyuk.jpg)This was emphasized by the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine General-General Pavlyuk during the "Uniform News" Tele scale.

- Yes, I have got the task from the President of Ukraine to create a working group. This is very important, because there is a lot of negative activity in the information space. The working group has already been created by the power block, namely: NAPC, DBR, SBU and National Police, which will be able to check on its issues. A group of armed forces has also been created to analyze the performance of service tasks - reported Pavlyuk.

He added that law enforcement agencies, among other things, will carefully check the responsibility of the lifestyle of the CCC and JV officials to those data in their declarations.

- The main thing in this work is not to interfere with the task of mobilizing. Why? First of all, we know well what was more attention to the Russian agency in 2014. It was to the mobilization processes. At the end of 2013, the system of military enlistment offices was only destroyed, which was not able to perform these important tasks. Therefore, it is not possible to allow this check to harm the execution of the basic tasks,-said Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk.

According to him, the Russian agency still works in the direction of creation of fakes in the activities of the Tax Code and JV. Therefore, it is necessary to check any information only by official sources. Unfortunately, some Ukrainian media fall into the information hook of the invaders.

- When analyzing all these processes, one must carefully approach the truth of other information. There are now many measures to improve confidence. Thus, 253 people have been gaminated for various reasons for various reasons. But it's not dogma. After all, just the replacement will be ineffective if the system does not work correctly, - said the defender of Ukraine.

He said that the servicemen of the Tax Code and JV were constantly sent to the front by a landing replacement with those who had a fighting or a fighting injury there.

- It is necessary to understand well that the Russians are not going to just give the thumbnails that have already captured. They use all tools: blasting Dambikakhovsky hydroelectric power plant, nuclear rhetoric, mines and more. Here it is important to correctly evaluate our offensive actions. It is not only the measurement of a kilometers of targeting the number of released settlements. The military is performing considerable tasks. For example, they perform the task of reducing the offensive of the enemy. If we talk about last week, 110 places of concentration of Russian army were destroyed by our armed forces. Also eliminated 11 management and 7 field warehouses with Russian weapons, - told the painter.

She also noted that the enemy continues to resist in all directions of linefront.

- The armed forces are now confidently moving Mariupol and Berdyansk. Every day there is a forward promotion. For example, to speak Prokhnopil, on the one hand - it is a small settlement, but our arms have first have to fix themselves there. That is, some distance we have passed, Apothim is given several days to fix. This should be taken into account when you read the news about a counter -offensive. Therefore, everything lasts according to the plan. Literally in front of Cimfir, I contacted the commander of individual areas. Therefore, I can say that now Rivnopil is fully controlled, - Hannamaars assured.

She reported that the main direction of the enemy's offensive remains East.

- The invaders are suffered by significant losses there. But here it should be understood that by the word "loss" our military implies: the fallen invaders wounded in captivity. Speaking about the current composition of the invaders, the Wagner PEC does not fight on the front. By the way, the Wagnerivtsi was threatened with shooting and periodically. Instead, other PECs and regular Russian, as we know, do not use such "motivation". The occupiers will be less confident in the war for them if they are undone in the back, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

First of all - about yesterday's Russian blow to Kramatorsk. Work on the site of the terrorist attack continued this. Unfortunately, the death toll increased. My muddy native. More than 60 people were injured and injured.

Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, together with the police special forces, had a person who adjusts this blow to terrorists. Just on the cafe of Uzramatorsk, on the popular pizzeria. Damaged neighboring homes, shops, dressing. Ordinary city, ordinary life. Under the rubble can still be people.

Anyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves a naximal punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators there. Everything is clear. These are people without humanity. Everyone in the world who does not understand that it is impossible to be an accomplice of a terrorist state must respond to the entire international community. The corrector is under the article on state treason. Punishment - including lifelong. The accomplices of the terrorist state should be considered as traitors of humanity and humanity.

We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia's accomplices. They should feel that the price of their terror for them will be increased. And we will continue our global legal work so that the international instruments have worked for the punishment of all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself.

Today, in an appeal to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on the occasion of the Constitution Day, he was about justice. Internal justice is a responsibility for violation of law in Ukraine. And about the justice of communicating with the Russian-Ukrainian war is about the responsibility of the Russian war. Justice policy will be one of the basics of Ukrainian Dokrin - a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country of the year.Ukraine and all in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand on protection of justice. Justice for all whose lives were exposed to Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory of all people, all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian inhumans!

I want to report the day briefly now.

Presidents of Lithuania and Poland were a visit - Hitanas Nausede and Andrzej Duda.

A very timely and useful visit - on the eve of Vilnius. The format of negotiations is span and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, a panel, for the decision to buy and pass the NASAMS systems, it is very necessary. They discussed common political challenges - both in the region and international countries. Of course, they also talked about the beginning of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union, which we expect this year.

He met with the main master-holder of the 47th separate mechanized brigade "Magura" Valery Marcus. They talked to him about the war, about our warriors, I will have a defense.

They discussed, in particular, the accounting reform in military structures. Less paper of bureaucracy, more digitalization. They discussed the reform of the Sergeant Corps. Khorosh conversation. Thank you for the chevrons!

Today, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, I was honored to reward our soldiers and to transmit state awards to our heroes. Very emotionally, very honorable. I worship our warriors!I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine!

I congratulate everyone on the Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, everyone and every one of the state, only to multiply the will, glory and independence of Ukraine!And so will it!

I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of the Kurban Bayram holiday. We will all get peace for our country, for our countries, for our children.

为了检察到南部地区Diviskov和国防领域专业检察官办公室的检察官，他被判犯有家庭叛国罪(艺术的第2部分。 《乌克兰刑法》 111).

Як свідчать матеріали слідства, екскерівник Миколаївської окружної прокуратуриспівпрацював із представниками силових структур рф. Для цього використовувавпосередника, щоб «відвести сліди від себе».

За наявними даними, він передавав інформацію про:

* оперативну обстановку у Миколаєві та області;  * загиблих військових і цивільних осіб, полонених, місця їх утримання;  * результати обстрілів Миколаєва;  * добові паролі на блокпости на території області тощо.

Щоб задокументувати зрадника, СБУ провела спецоперацію, в тому числі зімітації злочину. Через підставну особу українська спецслужба передалафігуранту імітовані списки загиблих військовослужбовців ЗСУ. Через декількаднів ці списки уже було зафіксовано у представника РФ, за яким також стежилаСБУ.

У результаті обшуків у фігуранта вилучено мобільний телефон, комп’ютернутехніку та флеш-носії, які містять докази його протиправної діяльності.

Наразі суд призначив йому покарання — довічне позбавлення волі з конфіскацієюмайна.
