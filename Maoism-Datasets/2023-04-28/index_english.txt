The State Duma deputy Gurulev stated that in Russia, it is time to introduce the concept of "enemular".

In this way, the Russian authorities analyze the reaction of their population with sophisticated radical statements from Kremlin politicians and propagandists, which allows to increase dictatorship.

Dear Ukrainians! 
Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...
To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave, - the necessary help is provided. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.
The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.
Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...
Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it weren't for this, the terrorist state would have been able to take much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.
Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.
I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.
He also spoke with the President of the European Council Charles Michel today. He informed him about the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack and thanked him with the support of our defense, our economic, our social stability.
Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.
Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.
Today, the landmark investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.
I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! 
Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine! 
Glory to Ukraine!

This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the evening video, which is given by Ukrinform.
Viso: 
Dear Ukrainians! 
Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...
To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave, - the necessary help is provided. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.
The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.
Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...
Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it weren't for this, the terrorist state would have been able to take much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.
Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.
I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.
He also spoke with the President of the European Council Charles Michel today. He informed him about the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack and thanked him with the support of our defense, our economic, our social stability.
Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.
Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.
Today, the landmark investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.
I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! 
Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine! 
Glory to Ukraine!

 On the basis of the Operations Command "North" continues the first course of training of persons in the specialty of Marxman(The infantry sniper). В управлінні бойовоїпідготовки командування наголошують, що нині марксменів тренують за досвідом,який інструктори набули з моменту широкомасштабного вторгнення росії вУкраїну.
Про це повідомляє Commander of the preparation of the Command of Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine General-Major Viktor Nikolyuk.
In the battle, the infantry sniper performs all the actions performed by the ordinary shooter. At the same time Marxman, through special training, weapons and targeted devices, has the opportunity to conduct high -precision fire for the purposes at distances that exceed the range of effective fire of the staffing of the unit and inaccessible to the infantry.
Unlike ordinary snipers, "accurate shooters" are an integral part of the unit and work for a general result, while sniffing for separate purposes alone or in pairs. They are indispensable in the case of immediate action, when there is no time for long calculations, due to the possibility of covering their unit from the fire of the enemy from the great distances.
The conditions of classes are as close as possible to real combat: the skills of archery are refined with overcoming the obstacle and masking strip.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stated that during a telephone conversation by the Chinese People's Republic, Xi Jinping, the issues of realizing the Ukrainian formula of peace, returning from Russia deported Ukrainian children, dismissal of prisoners, and providing a robotic grain initiative were exposed. The Head of State spoke about it during a meeting with media representatives as a result of negotiations with Presidential Slavonic, Zuzana Chaputova and Czech President Peter Pavel in Kiev.
Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine is set to involve as many states as possible in the implementation of the proposed peace formula in order to pressure the scam-aggressor.
"There were more countries to be involved in this formula or the discussion site of our formula and they could then press on Russian federation to restore peace, restore our territorial integrity," the President said.
The Head of State said that during a telephone conversation it was the need to restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within the borders of 1991 and the importance of compliance with the UN Charter.
“All this was talked about and heard respect for all these principles. I think it is important, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
The leaders of Ukraine and China also discussed the issue of returning Ukrainian and almost 20,000 children deported by Russian invaders.
"There are moments in which we have to connect everyone we can, different countries of the world so that they press on the aggressor and the terrorist - the Russian Federation, how many our children have been in the way," the President said.
According to the Head of State, during a telephone conversation with Xi Jinping, there was a threat of blocking the Black Sea Grain Corridor.
“Before the war, we were probably the largest grain exporter to China. And so, when it blocks it ... It seems to me that all interested countries should squeeze the Russian Federation so that there is no blocking of this corridor, ”he said.
In addition, when communicating with the head of the PRC, the President emphasized the supply of supplying weapons to the aggressor country by any state world.
“Ukraine would like all states to understand the risks of supplying any types of arms to the Russian Federation. I heard a positive answer in this sense, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

 _ Dear Ukrainians!_ 
Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...
To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave - is provided with the necessary help. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.
The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.
Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...
Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it were not that the terrorist state would have been able to pick up much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.
Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.
I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.
I outlined my partners what prospects we have on the battlefield now and what kind of help we need to go all this necessary path. I have informed what we do to realize our formula of peace, in particular the Ipoon on bringing the perpetrators responsible for aggression. Thank you that the Slavonic and the Czech Republic, equally with us, see the need to restore justice to the hypocrisy of war criminals, to punish all these terrorists.
They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.
Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.
Today, however, a significant investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.
I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!
_ Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, at combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine! _
Glory to Ukraine!
