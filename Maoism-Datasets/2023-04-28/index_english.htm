Further restricting measures can also be applied against persons involved in serious financial abuses around the use of public funds and the downturn of capital exports, as such actions may be directed to control or organize serious influences at state institutions.</p>
<p>The sanctions envisaged by this legal regime include freezing accounts and banning any financial resources for persons who will be included in the sanction list. In addition, the natural persons will prohibit the entrance to the EU.</p>

<p>This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the evening video, which is given by Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9362"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...</p>
<p>To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave, - the necessary help is provided. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.</p>
<p>The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...</p>
<p>Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it weren't for this, the terrorist state would have been able to take much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.</p>
<p>Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.</p>
<p>I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.</p>
<p>He also spoke with the President of the European Council Charles Michel today. He informed him about the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack and thanked him with the support of our defense, our economic, our social stability.</p>
<p>Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.</p>
<p>Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.</p>
<p>Today, the landmark investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.</p>
<p><strong> I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>“We really discussed the issue of a counter -offensive. I handed over two signals to my colleagues, which they seem to be divided. First, this counter-offensive should not be considered a final battle. The final battle will be the one that will lead to the complete liberation of the territory of Ukraine, but this is the conclusion that can only be drawn to the battle - not at its beginning, ”he said.</p>

<p>He also noted that the team was working on, but the game arranged it.</p>
<p>“Everything, in principle, was normal. We controlled the game, although not everything was possible. We were moments in the first half that we had to implement. They understood what our opponent would play. We missed some acute cases. Then we scored two balls, and allegedly everything had to be great. But then it was a decoration, and the team was confused. We will understand why it happened. The problem is that someone was wrong and we missed a goal. Everyone is mistaken. The problem of fatigue is that after the goal we were lost for some reason. After missing, a confusion began, which lasted until the third scored ball, ”said Dynamo coach.</p>

До них можутьналежати й публічні заклики до "дій проти територіальної цілісності країни",заклики до екстремізму та реабілітація нацизму. Закон стосується тільки тихросіян, громадянство у яких придбане, а не народжене.</p>

<p>About it reports <a href="https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-protocluster-early-universe"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"This is a special, unique place for the accelerated evolution of galaxies, and James Webb telescope has given us an unprecedented opportunity to measure the speed of these seven -galactot and confirm that they are united in the protocrat hole," said Takahiro Morishita Astrone.</p>

<p>The clusters of galaxies that have a high red displacement in 7.9 existed only 650 million light years after the Big Bang, so help to answer the fundamental questions about the evolution of the universe. Such characteristics also make them the most ancient galaxies that were inspected .</p>
<p>The team was able to determine that galaxies were moving at a speed of more than 3.2 million kilometers per hour. The speed and the distance between the galaxies was a meter -free spectrograph of the Nirspec infrared range on Bortitelescope.</p>

<p>The collection contains 39 thousand unique genetic samples that come in Ukraine. Scientists believe that the preservation of Ukrainian collections of wheat, triticale, barley, peas, chickpeas, feed crops of the temperate zone and sunflower is critical for world crop production.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-28T18-30-14-03-00/1682695689-911.jpg" />The ministry adds that the volume and variety of genetic material plants contained in the seed collection and the lack of duplication of the material with a other seed bank makes it unique and important for the Ukrainian and global food security for the Ukrainian farm.</p>
<p>“Although the collection is now located in a safe place, a further robotagers of providing a sustainable decision in the long run are needed.

<p>It is reported that international practice is to ensure the duplication of tags of such collections in at least two places, one of which should be a surprise repository of seeds in Svalbard, in case of damage to national collections. Earlier, Ukraine has transferred about 2,700 samples of grain hip crops to the worldwide storage of seeds in Svalbard, but the majority of its collection still has no backup duplication.</p>
<p>International partners support the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine in the development and implementation of a plan of long -term preservation of tabular reproduction of genetic resources, including the future storage of the UNDERVENTAL HEASHING SHOWER IN Svalben. However, the construction of a tax repository in the west of Ukraine has begun."This initiative makes an important contribution to the future production of food and persistent means of existence in Ukraine, as well as a supporting critical role that it plays for global food security," said FAO Head of FAO in Ukraine, Pierre Votier.</p>
<p>The ministry emphasizes that every sample of seeds stored by a grocery bank is a unique additional tool accessible to seeds, researchers and farmers in combating climate change and food safety.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, as of 2021, more than 150 thousand genetic materials of plants belonging to 544 species of crops and 1802 plant samples were stored in Ukraine.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, a photo of the Patriarch's decree on the deprivation of the dignity was published by Kuraev in <a href="https://t.me/akuraev/9697"></a>.</p>
<p>The document states that for more than two years, which have passed since the banning of the Kuriev, he has not changed his position and continues "anti -churchiness", which made it a decision to deprive him of his dignity.</p>
<p>“The right to co -party with the present Patriarch Kirill, that is, who made Winsebe made is a dubious honor. I did not consider it and do not consider it a cherished ” - <a href="https://t.me/akuraev/9698"></a> <a href="https://t.me/akuraev/9698"> </a>The decision of Kurayev. He did not rule out that he would file a complaint with the Ecumenical Patriarchal.</p>
<p>In December 2020, the Diocesan Church Court of the ROC deprived the Danction of Protodiaconii Kuri. Patriarch Kiril, however, imposed a moratorium on this decision, and it has given time to "rethink the position". At the same time, since April of the same year, the Curliev was temporarily forbidden in the service of Patriarch Kirill. His harsh words about one of the dead priests were pretended.</p>

<p>Zelensky expressed deep concern with such decisions and emphasized that the works were a gross violation of the letter and the spirit of the Association Agreement and the EU Constituent Hours.</p>
<p>“Artificial unlawful restriction of trade with the European Union beats Ukraine, which signs Russian aggression, both economically and politically. I am convinced that in the face of war with Russia, Ukraine as a candidate and EU country should comply with the provisions of the Association Agreement and rules and regulations of the EU Uniform Market.

<p>This was reported by NAPC expert on work with sanctions Yevgen Kasyan during the time discussion "Finance of the Terroist country: how to confiscate?" In the Media Center - Ukrinform.</p>
<p>According to him, as of the beginning of April 2023, sanctions were imposed against 13 thousand out of 24 thousand defendants of this list.</p>
<p>“At first, the work was not progressing as we would like. Therefore, the existing track, which was in the pre -war period, and the one that the country needs during the war is significantly different. Now you need to move hundreds of times more. And it was possible to do it since last year September, ”said Kashayan</p>
<p>According to him, this has been to some extent, apparently, thanks to the complaints of the national partners, that they generally imposed more restrictions on the Russian -related people than the Russian country.</p>
<p>Among the important tools for identifying the persons involved in the armed aggression - applicants for sanctions, the expert named the recently created portal <a href="https://sanctions.nazk.gov.ua/"></a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the portal is to synchronize the sanctions lists of Ukraine and international partners on the accomplices of Russian crime. The data, in particular, the Ukrainian and global businesses are used to determine whether to work with certain persons and companies.</p>
<p>According to the Agency's representative, another direction of work of the NACC is the preparation of legislative changes that allow not only to block Russian assets, but also to confiscate them.</p>
<p>“In this matter, we cooperate with the Ministry of Justice. And over 800 Ministry of Justice has already been elaborated on the search for assets of podvational persons - Russians of Tarosian companies. We are looking for such assets in the territory of Ukraine, passage of documents to the Ministry of Justice, which in court charges the quiches and property, ”Kasyan said.</p>
<p>As examples, he cited the assets of Putin's Blinders Deripaska and the Rothenberg family in favor of Ukraine.

<p>He added that "different scenarios" are taken into account, but the situation is stable and "very quickly will be established what happened."</p>
<p>As it was reported, according to the Ministry of National Defense <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-polsa"></a>Near the city of Bidgosch(North of Poland)Ulylismuga April 25 <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3701379-u-polsi-znajsli-ulamki-vijskovogo-obekta-zmi-pisut-pro-raketu-iz-napisami-rosijskou.html"></a>. The Prosecutor General of Poland Zbignev Zgobro emphasized that the military department of the district prosecutor's office in Gdansk under the supervision of the National Prosecutor's Office has opened a case about the remains of an air military facility found near Bidgosch. The forest where an unknown military object was found, surrounded by the surrounding one, is not missed there.According to the unofficial data of RMF24, in the forest there was a rocket of the class "Air-Earth". It was seen on April 25, but it could fall even earlier, even for a few days of Chitizhnov. As it is noted, at first the Polish military believed that it was a drone, but then they came to the conclusion that these could be elements of a rocket. On the wreckage, they are in Russian. It is unknown whether it has exploded. It is known that there is a large hole in the ground in the place of falling, as after a bomb explosion.</p>
<p>In November 2022, two people were in the Polish village of Pshevodau, a Hrubeshiv district, near the Ukrainian border, as a result of the explosion.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in Warsaw confirmed that the explosion occurred as a result of the fall of the Rapentius production, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was summoned by Russia's ambassador.</p>
<p>Later, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that in Poland, the Ukrainian missile was in an attempt to protect against the Russian attack, but there is no guilt here because it was defended from a massive attack by the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the evening video, which is given by Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9362"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...</p>
<p>To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave, - the necessary help is provided. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.</p>
<p>The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...</p>
<p>Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it weren't for this, the terrorist state would have been able to take much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.</p>
<p>Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.</p>
<p>I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.</p>
<p>He also spoke with the President of the European Council Charles Michel today. He informed him about the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack and thanked him with the support of our defense, our economic, our social stability.</p>
<p>Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.</p>
<p>Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.</p>
<p>Today, the landmark investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.</p>
<p><strong> I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, in combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>The most replaced are agricultural lands in Kherson, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions - MP, member of the Committee of Agrarian and Land Policy Dmitry Solomchuk.</p>
<p>The main danger is that explosive objects are located not on the surface, but also at a depth of 20-40 centimeters.</p>
<p>Dmitry Solomchuk, a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy, told about it.</p>
<p>“It is very important for us to exchanges the fields with special machines that destroy the excellent objects at a depth of up to 60 centimeters. If you do only overwhelming mine, then any agricultural machinery, harrows or seeders is in danger. That is why, every day, we have reports on the blasting of the farm equipment of the inhabited fields, ”the politician said.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the fighting was differently influenced on different lands.</p>
<p>“It is important to keep in mind that those fields where mines were simply installed are completely suitable for agriculture. However, there are lands, lakes and shells, and the lower and upper layers of the earth are mixed. Special fertilizers are required to restore such fields, it is necessary to restore the fertility of these lands. It's all extra effort and extra time, ”said the parliamentary.</p>
<p>According to him, the speed of agricultural land demends depends on the number of special sapper automated complexes.</p>
<p>“If there are 200-300 such machines in Ukraine, it is real to change all the areas in a few years and get a good result. If the technique is not possible to change manually, then everything can be delayed for decades. In addition, the danger of demining increases significantly, ”the People's Deput emphasized.</p>
<p>He also recalled that approximately 20% of agricultural land will not be sown.</p>

<p>"This is a clear demonstration to all violators around the world that the problem of abduction and deportation <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti"></a>During armed conflicts, such as Russia's war against Ukraine, it remains a priority to the day of the day of the member states and civil society, ”he said.</p>

<p>Unlike ordinary snipers, "accurate shooters" are an integral part of the unit and work for a general result, while sniffing for separate purposes alone or in pairs. They are indispensable in the case of immediate action, when there is no time for long calculations, due to the possibility of covering their unit from the fire of the enemy from the great distances.</p>

<p>This was reported during the presentation of the newly formed advisory and advisory bodies of the Ministry of Defense-the Public Anti-Corruption Council and the Office of Support-reported by the Head of the Office of Changes at the Ministry of Defense Yulia Marushevskaya.</p>
<p>“It is important for us not to produce endless strategies, conversations, meetings. For us, therefore, so we even internally call this office as a such as a changeer of change. And the approach is when we take a separate change in turn, a separate project, build a team from the best professionals of Ukraine under this change, and perhaps also involve a world expert, and we launch this change. And so in the way - change by change - we look forward to stable fundamental systemic changes in the system of the Ministry of Defense, ”YuliaMarushevskaya stressed.</p>
<p>She explained that the Office of Amendments to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is a consulting and advisory body at MOU. Its main function is to attract the best professionals, the best experts in their fields, which are in Ukraine today in order to transform purchases into the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, as well as all related structures.</p>
<p>“The first project is the procurement reform that concerns exclusively of non -lethal. And as a result of the launch of this project, the procurement agency was created to help share the functionality that the Ministry is in the ministry(<em>bones. - ed .</em>), which is now concentrated in one of the departments(The Defense Ministry. - ed ._). Це — формування політики,норм, правил гри, того, як мають функціонувати відносини покупця і продавця,те, як мають функціонувати закупівлі. Ми хочемо, аби цей «мозок», формуванняполітик залишився в Міністерстві оборони, а сам процес закупівель — перейшов вАгентство, в професійний орган», — підсумувала Юлія Марушевська.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-28T61-00-00-04-00/5f6a4724.jpg" />Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov noted that the society is expecting a transparency in the procurement of the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>The head of the Ukrainian defense department stated this during the presentation of the consultative and advisory bodies at the Ministry of Defense-the Public Anti-Corruption Council and the Office for Supporting Changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Society is absolutely right to demand transparency to control how public finances are used, because everyone pays taxes, the budget is formed from these taxes, and from this budget the funds come from this budget and we use them to provide the armed forces, - explained Alexei Reznikov.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why the newly created bodies - the Public Anti -Corruption Council and the Office to support changes - should play an important role in the transparency of purchases.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's(<em>The public anti -corruption council. - ed .</em>)will really be a very powerful independent organ, as well as(<em>what and office to support change. - ed .</em>)—Axelerator of vision and ideas that will help me through political decisions, through political will, through administrative impact to change the system for the better. At the same time, realizing that our task is not to break the system of stable, uninterrupted, systematic support of armed force Ukraine, especially now, during open aggression from the Russians, open. And here I hope for the interaction of the Anti -Corruption Council with the Office of Support. The office has ideas, they will be able to work superprocesses, on approaches, on the system. And yours(<em>Anticroup. —Er.</em>)The task is to assess corruption. I need your expertise - where there are corrupt risks, - the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine said.</li>
</ul>
<p>He added that on the part of military expectations of the functioning of new bodies, at first, they will be aimed at fair use of funds for their provision.</p>
<ul>
<li>The third expectation is our partners, because the level of trust that we have to establish today is incredible. That is why we get Patriots, Himars, MLRS, tanks and planes. But there is a nuance: we get all this technique, in the first place. Billions of US $ 80 We have already received international technical assistance. And all this is due to trust. And their society is to understand that the funds sent from taxpayers to purchase weapons or to us are also used and used properly, clearly and transparently, - said Alexei Reznikov.</li>

<p>According to the operating model presented, the Ministry of Defense will form the right -handed, and the procurement agency in the field of defense will be carried out according to the implementation.</p>
<p>This was during the presentation of the newly formed advisory and advisory bodies of the Ministry of Defense-the Public Anti-Corruption Council and the support office-reported by a member of the Office of Support at the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the head of the project team Arsen Zhumadilov.</p>
<ul>
<li>The way purchases now operate, and what causes a community to be complained, it seems that Mow forms rules, implements policy, but is not controlled. Our operating model implies that the Defense Ministry should be able to focus on the formation of policy, that is, understanding what the army should be. We offer what has been implemented in the field of protection, - said Arsen Zhumadilov.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, the implementation of the office's policy descends to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the command and to those military units that are authorized to formulate.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a request from a client who is further sent to a specially created agency that has all the necessary resources in his state in order to sell all these purchases qualitatively, - he said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The office is currently working on filling the agency with a regulatory regulatory basket and management documents.</p>
<p>The head of the projected team stressed that it is the Defense Ministry that will focus on reconciliation and control. At the same time, the General Staff of the Armed Forces and Command are being implemented all that was settled in this way.</p>
<p>Arsen Zhumadilov noted that the agency is planning to launch in the near future.</p>
<p>According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov, there will be an existence of a commercial structure, which, efficiently using public funds, will satisfy this need and provide a service or service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our ambition goes beyond only providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Yaviri that we will create the best agency, and then other representatives of the sector of the Defense will want to use our service, - summarized the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.</li>

<ul>
<li>The council includes 15 people. They are all very different, and I say that sometimes it is easy to make decisions. However, they are concentrated and should bring the result. Voting for members of the Public Anti -Corruption Council was open and transparent. There are dissatisfied people, I will say more, there are criminal proceedings: allegedly this vote was opaque. In fact, this is not the case. Today, more than 40,000 people, including the military, have been delegated to the Public Council. Each member of the Council has a personal responsibility to society, to the military, who now give the incentiveness of a safe life.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Yevgeny Grushovts, the Civic Anti -Corruption Council has today been challenged.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think we will try to control the newly created office support office, but we will put a key emphasis on purchases and procedures. There is a common vision: not to fight the consequences, but to influence those processes that are already happening, analyze them and know what will happen next.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Yevgeny Grushovts, the effectiveness of the council depends on the position of the Defense Ministry.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the last meeting with the leadership of the military department, we were assured: "You will commemorate" Green Light ", you will receive all access," - said the Chief Anti -Corruption Council. - We have already prepared the first inquiries inquartered them to official boxes. We hope that we will get answers quickly enough and be able to analyze and determine whether there is a violation, inflated prices are not. It seems to some that these are simple questions, in fact - no. The Council delayed the permanent commissions that will work in specific areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Yevgeny Hrushovets assured that members of the Anti -Corruption Council seek to work without a haap, but they are effectively, and hope that they will have all the levers for this. Even though the society is somewhat skeptical to the activities of public councils(They are currently working in virtually in all consciousness), members of the Anti -Corruption Council will do everything possible to improve the activities of the Ministry of Defense.</p>

<p>In his introductory speech, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiresnikov outlined the task of these newly formed consulting and advisory bodies.</p>
<p>According to him, on February 24 last year, when the war with the Russian aggressor changed its status from hybrid to large -scale, the main thing for our nation, our nation was survival. Therefore, the tasks of fast and qualitative mobilization, increasing the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and ensuring the entire defense sector were necessary for the resistance of enemy resources: clothing, food and, above all, weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>And if you all remember, at the beginning, our partners were made to the guerrilla warfare, so it was more about the means of hitting the short distances ... Happiness was with you Stinger, Javelin, Nlaw Tapiorun. Now we have heavy artillery, Himars, armored vehicles of almost all the main types and brands you know, a tank coalition has been created, and Patriot is already standing. Today, NATO countries have been passing to us by the Soviet model, but I am convinced that soon we will be as calm to speak as about Patriot, about modern combatants, - said Alexei Reznikov. - The first stage of survival we have gone and we have gone, now we need to define new goals. Therefore, the main task of the Ministry is to improve the efficiency of defense, which will allow this war to Ukraine and enter the borders of 1991.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the minister, the state is aimed at creating such a system of resistance to the country, which will be able to keep any blow to even the desire of the Russian Federation to resort to revenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our main value is the life of our soldiers - defenders and defenders, their health. And around this center of gravity, we build all the processes: we will make weapons, preparation, maintenance and repair of equipment. The more people we save, the more stable our defense will be, the more stable it will be a crap, - Alexei Reznikov is sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Minister of Defense stressed that it is important to improve the efficiency of use of resources now, to find new solutions to ensure our Army is necessary:Alexei Reznikov informed journalists that the promotion of these reforms will be facilitated(OPZ), Public Anti -Corruption Council and Working Group on Medical Support.</p>
<p>Yulia Marushevskaya became the head of the OPP. The office will first direct its efforts of the public procurement of the Ministry of Defense, which will ensure the continuity, stability and controllability of the supply system for the needs of the Armed Forces. The team from this reform was headed by Arsen Zhumadilov, who, according to Alexei Reznikov, has experienced experience of such work, in particular in the Ministry of Health.</p>
<ul>
<li>The second very important block is the creation of a public anti -corruption council. Thousands of people voted for its composition. I think it is a serious mandate for it. Together with me, he was elected chairman of the council Yevhen Grushovetst, his deputy Anastasia Shuba, - said Alexei Reznikov.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present at the press conference was informed that three commissions were established and have already started working as part of the Public Anti -Corruption Council: on the provision and procurement, monitoring of legislation and normative activity and on communication, personnel work and expert discussions.</p>

The Head of State spoke about it during a meeting with media representatives as a result of negotiations with Presidential Slavonic, Zuzana Chaputova and Czech President Peter Pavel in Kiev.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine is set to involve as many states as possible in the implementation of the proposed peace formula in order to pressure the scam-aggressor.</p>
<p>"There were more countries to be involved in this formula or the discussion site of our formula and they could then press on Russian federation to restore peace, restore our territorial integrity," the President said.</p>
<p>The Head of State said that during a telephone conversation it was the need to restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within the borders of 1991 and the importance of compliance with the UN Charter.</p>
<p>“All this was talked about and heard respect for all these principles. I think it is important, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>The leaders of Ukraine and China also discussed the issue of returning Ukrainian and almost 20,000 children deported by Russian invaders.</p>
<p>"There are moments in which we have to connect everyone we can, different countries of the world so that they press on the aggressor and the terrorist - the Russian Federation, how many our children have been in the way," the President said.</p>
<p>According to the Head of State, during a telephone conversation with Xi Jinping, there was a threat of blocking the Black Sea Grain Corridor.</p>
<p>“Before the war, we were probably the largest grain exporter to China. And so, when it blocks it ... It seems to me that all interested countries should squeeze the Russian Federation so that there is no blocking of this corridor, ”he said.</p>
<p>In addition, when communicating with the head of the PRC, the President emphasized the supply of supplying weapons to the aggressor country by any state world.</p>
<p>“Ukraine would like all states to understand the risks of supplying any types of arms to the Russian Federation. I heard a positive answer in this sense, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-28T94-00-00-04-00/01-marafon-nezlamnyh-golovna.jpg" /><strong> For two friends - the veteran of the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Maxim Pasichnyk Taodni of Vadim Kovalenko, the period of the main preparation for the charity race within the framework brothers. What are the scrutples the Ukrainian delegation goes overseas, its participants </strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhLzZBB3iLA"><strong> told </strong></a><strong> Today during the time TV. </strong></p>
<p>According to the Ukrainian triatlet Vadim Kovalenko, the first of the marathon service fled in the Kyiv region, starting from the well -known airport to the world. Then they managed to raise about 300 thousand hryvnias for armed force to rehabilitate the wounded Ukrainian military. The second marathon of the subookuo -corresponding territories of Kharkiv region has collected for Ukrainian defenders over 200 thousand hryvnias.</p>
<p>The third marathon will continue in Ohio, Cincinnat, in the city of twilight. The leadership of the American city, the US military veterans of the Tujrahn diaspora eagerly supported the idea of conducting a charity race to their annual marathon. The organizers of the action stipulate that about 25 thousand people will take part in the marathon in 2023. Ukrainians will be a separate distance of two, but at the end of the finish will join their American friends to demonstrate the world unity with the Ukrainian courageous, with its defenders.</p>
<p>The main goal, according to Vadim Kovalenko, on the one hand is the intention of gathering for psychological and physical rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. From another diver - the "marathon of the unbreakable" should be reminded that the war in Ukraine continues and Ukrainian -pricing requires comprehensive support from American society. In addition, the organizers of the charity marathon plan to visit the military shepherd, where they will get acquainted with modern methods of rehabilitation. During their Visit to the military medical institution in Cincinnat, friends want to hold negotiations about the possible treatment of Ukrainian defenders of the Vedicanian city-twin city of Kharkiv.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will last two or three presses every day. The first meeting will be with the mayor of the city, - said Vadim Kovalenko. - And the second will be a rearitory hall, because American veterans who immediately agreed to this meeting will come not only from Ohio, but also from other regions of America.- We go beyond the possible. Usually people do not train the way we are. The average preparation for the marathon lasts from half a year to one year. This is necessary to run it without injuries, - Maxim Pasichnyk emphasized. - I believe to all that there are no boundaries. You can all!Even if you have injuries, injuries, some defects or deviations, you can overcome everything. All this is just a head.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-28T94-00-00-04-00/02-marafon-start-u-gostomeli.jpg" />The paratrooper decided to carry out the first charitable hemisphere marathon, which, like Maxim himself, got the contusion of the misery for his homeland. In 2022, Maxim Pasichnyk participated in the Operation of Antonov Airport from the Russian invaders and was forced to get out of the rear of Russian troops without water and food for 10 days. Naragia over 100 kilometers overcame the courageous Ukrainian military. It is the prominence of Ukrainian defenders, the heroism of the fighting brothers that plans to reconvisor the veteran of the DSSV of the Armed Forces to their American colleagues. The "marathon of the unbreakable" of the USSH must convincingly testify to these inalienable qualities of military armed forces.</p>

<p>Along the day, there was a parsing in Uman, at the site of the Russian rocket. My mingers to relatives and loved ones ...</p>
<p>To all who were saved - the residents of this house, the neighboring houses, which, unfortunately, with an explosive wave - is provided with the necessary help. I am thankful and everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supported people.</p>
<p>The Uman rocket, in the city that is absolutely peaceful, is known to the world in that it has received tens of thousands of pilgrims of host every year ... Only the absolute evil can do such a terror against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Two -Ukrainian killed in Dnipropetrovsk region as a result of today's rocket strike. Mother and daughter. Olga, 92nd year of birth, and Veronica, 20 years of birth. Even three years, this child is not fulfilled!Eternal memory!.. sympathy for the family, compassion for loved ones ...</p>
<p>Today, our air forces have managed to knock down most Russian missiles-21z 23. If it were not that the terrorist state would have been able to pick up much more victims, more lives. And this again proves that stopping terror and saving people can be more weapons. Air Force, modern aviation, without which there is no fully effective ART. All you need to give safety to our cities, our villages both in the rear and in the forefront. To restore safety and luggage, which, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We can leave no one under the rule of Russian evil.</p>
<p>Today in Kyiv a visit was a president of Slovakia, the President of the Czech Republic. We have been extinguished exactly how to protect all our people, to accelerate the recovery and order throughout the earth.</p>
<p>I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the weapons provided, political tasancial assistance, with the support of people who received shelter in Slovak Ichi communities.</p>
<p>I outlined my partners what prospects we have on the battlefield now and what kind of help we need to go all this necessary path. I have informed what we do to realize our formula of peace, in particular the Ipoon on bringing the perpetrators responsible for aggression. Thank you that the Slavonic and the Czech Republic, equally with us, see the need to restore justice to the hypocrisy of war criminals, to punish all these terrorists.</p>
<p>They signed a joint declaration with Slovak President and the Czech President of our European and Euro -Atlantic Movement.Separately discussed with Mr. the President of the European Council, the situation of the stubborn -nostructive, in my opinion, was prohibited by individual states of import of our agrarian products. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing pro -asset agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, but also gives dangerous hope in the Kremlin. It is hopeful that in our common European home, someone's wrong decisions can be paid over common interests.</p>
<p>Now that Russia violates freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is not time to follow anyone with a derivated zone, to do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, in the European manner, a constructive way out of this situation. difficult. Such a decision would have been the interests of all our countries and Europe as a whole. We discussed Zpan Michel, how it can be done, what a solution can be, and we constantly contact all partners.</p>
<p>Today, however, a significant investment event for Ukraine has taken place - the first large investment in Ukraine from the beginning of a full -scale invasion. The investment is $ 250 million, and this is just a start of the relevant package. Right now, the Colima is still fighting Russian terror, the big world business not only believes UNash victory, but also confirms this faith with its multimillion -dollar investments, specifics.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!</p>
<p>_ <strong> Glory to all our soldiers, who is now in battle, in combat posts, at combat operations!Thank you to the people of Ukraine!</strong> _</p>
