<p>The Government Response Team of Ukraine Cert-UA, which operates under the State Secretariat, reports the cyber-funding that has been established by the establishment of an unlicensed program. Pirate programs open the hackers to computer systems of enterprises and organizations.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsszzi/posts/pfbid0nBxBmDd1R1ZRxzyxyqCMYrrVmcRfburNoHt8vysAF9fMLb6EBWCFTVks5tPo74uQl">reports</a>State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In March 2023, team specialists received data on detection of trait access to the information and communication system(X)One of the utility companies. During the computer-technical research of electronic-computing machines, experts found that the primary compromise was made in January this year. Then one of the Users of the Uploaded License version of Microsoft Office 2019. Together with it, the Darkcrystal RAT was installed on the device and a remote Dwagent administration. This created the preconditions for unauthorized accessible to the MPS from January 19 to March 22, 2023.</p>
<p>Cert-UA points out that such a vector of primary compromise is not found. There are known cases of device infection not only after use of Microsoft Office's non -licensing programs, but also when downloading from informal operating systems from informal sources, as well as other programs(scanners, password -renewal tools, etc.).</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T67-00-00-04-00/1-10.jpg" />Today, the 74th anniversary of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Main and Political Union in the world, is marking the North Atlantic Alliance. NATO became the basis of a single system of Evro -Atlantic security from Canada to the Baltic countries. For Ukraine, membership of the Educational Alliance is one of the key goals of foreign policy. More about how NATO was created and about its present in the Army's Army.</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, Europe lay in ruins. The United States came out with a superpower, which created military bases on all continents. The warnings of the Western countries to take into account the lessons of the two world wars - that it was better to work with each other than to hostile, led to awareness of the most integration at the military level.</p>
<p>The initiative of the creation of a new union of states came from the United States and the United Kingdom. British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin contributed to the signing of the Brussels Treaty in 1948. The document created the Defense Alliance of Benilux countries(Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg), France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>After that, the conversations of the US, Canada and Britain began to create an Atlantic security system. The novelty of NATO was that the universal defense was committed by the US to the Allies in Europe. In the case of a conditional attack on France, US troops stationed by the Navara European Continent would come to the rescue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T67-00-00-04-00/2-12.jpg" />Signing the Vashington Agreement</p>
<p>On April 4, 1949, the Washington Agreement was signed in the US capital, which was consumed by a document that created the North Atlantic Alliance. However, active discussions between the three major countries - the United States, Great Britain and France - were foreseen.</p>
<h3><strong> Signing of Washington Agreement </strong></h3>
<p>Paris saw the future of NATO as a global organization, and Washington and London planned the Alliance as the only security system in the Euro -Atlantic. Excellent views between the Allies were also the inclusion of colonies in collective protection. Then, in the late 1940s, European states were still colonial empire(https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67656.htm).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T67-00-00-04-00/3-9.jpg" />Signature</p>
<p>Belgium proposed to mention the Congo, and France Algeria. After all, Algeria remained.* “On the territory of any of the parties in Europe or North America, at the Algerian Departments of France, in Turkey, or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropics of Cancer; * On the forces, vessels or planes of any side when they are in or above, or in any other zone in Europe, where the occupation forces of any of the parties were placed on the date when the contract was obtained validity, either in the Mediterranean, or the North Atlantic area north of the Cancer Tropics. "</p>
<p>The solemn signing of the NATO Establishment in Washington was the initial military-political union. The then US President Harry Truman was among those who saw in the North Atlantic Alliance the future of the safety of and the defense. Moreover, the Cold War began - a period of US struggle with a treacherous union. Europe was divided into opposing camps. By the way, Truminen was the author of the doctrine of restraint, which involved the active cooperation of the allies with the purpose of not widening communism in the world.</p>
<p>12 countries created the North Atlantic Alliance in 1949: the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Norway.</p>
<p>For military integration in NATO in 1951, the headquarters of the Supreme High Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europe was established. The first Supreme Chief Commander was the American General, the Hero of the First World War Taxer of Allies in World War II David Dauyt Eisenhower.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T67-00-00-04-00/4-8-scaled.jpg" />Eisenhower and letter of its appointment</p>
<p>During the Cold War, NATO became the main outpost of the West in the struggle of the USSR. Although Timothy Andrews Sale notes, the author of the book "Strong Alliance: NATO's History and Global Post -war Order", the Alliance was more likely to be a direct threat to the Soviet invasion, and rather indirect interventions of the USSRSPAGANDS, intelligence. In other words, to influence the public opinion of Ukraine NATO on the placement of ballistic missiles or other operations of military work of allies.</p>
<p>The main principle of the Alliance was and remains the civil control of the military. NATO Gensions usually became the former defense ministers, foreign affairs of Chipremiers of Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Denmark.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T67-00-00-04-00/5-7.jpg" />Marcaniederland in honor of the 40th anniversary of NATOIndeed, the period of the 1990s in the history of the Alliance has passed under the desire to attract the Komun communist states in cooperation. On the initiative of US President Billaclineton, in 1994, the NATO Peace Partnership Program was announced in 1994. Therefore, there was an atmosphere of the possibility of coexistence of the former supervisors - this concerned in particular Russia. But, as we saw later, the Kremlin did not give up its imperial complexes with the military invasion of other sovereign states.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was in the 1990s that the North Atlantic Alliance began to actively work with public diplomacy. The latter is to create a positive NATO abroad through informing about the activities of the organization for Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong> In 1997, key events of relations of Ukraine </strong> - <strong> NATO: </strong></p>
<p>· NATO Information and Documentation Center in Ukraine has been established;</p>
<p>· At the Madrid Summit, President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma signed KhartiyUkraine - NATO;</p>
<p>· A mission of Ukraine with NATO was opened at the Alliance headquarters.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2001, the US terrorist attacks were a turning point in NATO history. So the only time the 5th Article of the Washington Agreement was applied. On 7 October 2002, the United States launched an anti-terrorist operation against the Taliban Vaffganistan, which was joined by NATO Allies and Partner countries through acting contingents. Among these states was Ukraine. In the end, the most relevant in the history of the Alliance, which lasted 20 years, ended with the withdrawal of military in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>In June 2020, Ukraine received the status of a partner with advanced opportunities. Although the cooperation of our country with the Alliance has been going on since the 1990s: joint military exercises, rehabilitation of Ukrainian military abroad, and the implementation of NATO standards in the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine.</p>

<p>After a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, a natively revised security strategy. In the new strategic concept of the Alliance, approved at the summit in Madrid in June 2022, Rosiybul was named "the main security threat to the Euro -Atlantic region."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/gumenyuk-rozpovila.jpg" />"So it happened that night. Using the peculiarities of the Shahheda launch, they began to use the relief of the coast and the coastal zone, in particular, the Bplabuli launched at a very low distance above water levels. This usually complicates their detection of air defense systems - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">stated</a>Natalia Humeniuk, Head of the Joint Present Center of Southern Ukraine forces of Southern Ukraine, during the Non -New News Etherer.</p>
<p>In addition, the officer noted that the work of the defenders of the sky began simultaneously with a danger of air anxiety. This is due to the fact that the priority was devoted to combat work and then notified. Such cases are not often, but they still happen. This happens because of a very high system of systemPPO during massive attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>I draw attention to the fact that the enemy launched 17 "Shahaned" in order for some of the outs to be distracted by the maneuver, and that our air defense worked on them, the bypassing maneuvers for hits into industry objects - Dodalakapitan and rank.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that the enemy's army aimed at several goals. It was directed in different directions. This indicates the probable tacticorosis of air defense forces. The efficiency of beating the southworks confuses the enemy, so they have not used tortoise or UAV for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>When they carry out the attack in our direction, they try to bypass Ukrainian air defense. We now record that Russians focus more attention to the enclosure of engineering structures and defense. Occupation troops are also strengthened by the Taxes of Defense, as they realize that they will soon take them, - said Natalia Humeniuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, the enemy army has struck three times with the managed aviation bombamiberislav and Kherson districts. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but such a lot of destruction is caused. Again, the invaders directed them to industry and agricultural land. This is to ensure that the region is not likely to develop and revive.</p>

Institute of military chaplaincy in Ukraine: formation, mission, ecumenism" with the expensive of representatives of the military chaplaincy of the commander -in The Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces Colonel Alexeieshchuk.</p>
<p>The relevance of the military chaplaincy began with the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in 2014. It was then that the priests began to go to the war zones as volunteers to support and assist the military and civilian population. The next stage of 2015–2016, when the priests came to the army of chaplains as civilians. However, the state could not provide all guarantees and rights for this person in the area of hostilities, which is where there should be a military cape. Be near the serviceman. Therefore, in 2021 he acquired the validity of Ukraine "On the Military Chaplaincy Service". It was after the ancestral component invasion in 2022 began to be implemented by the official chaplaincy, which was created in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on the "Military Chaplaincy Service", which is directly subordinated to the head of the Armed Forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>At present, we have fundamental changes: a military chaplain is an officer. He is the military rank and position, he in his uniforms with his servicemen - this is the standard of most NATO countries. Like their structure, the other military chaplain is an assistant who performs the function of physical protection and weapons in his hands because our military chaplain is not a combatant. Therefore, the military chaplain always has an assistant. Now there are military chaplains in each breeze or a separate battalion, - said Alexeieshtreshuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also told that the main task that sets a organization is to meet the spiritual and religious needs of a serviceman.<em>Foto Dmitry Yurchenko</em></p>

<p>In this way, the enemy tries to "felt" our air defense to ideal, where we have stronger places, and where we are weaker, so they are attacked from various nations, in particular from the coast of the Azov Sea. About it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">stated</a>During the "Uniform News" Telelorphone, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Yurignat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now they start much less drones. It is worth remembering the New Year's night. Then the enemy released a record 45 UAV on the territory of Ukraine, and the next one - 39. Then our air defense forces shot down all the "chess". We now see the lessactivity of the use of drones-Kamikadze. Nevertheless, Russia has the production of shock UAV-"Lancet-1", "Lancet-2", "Lancet-3" with different combat part. This is primarily the defenders in the leading positions. These drones are directed with a camera, they have an operator who tries to stress the armored equipment. Various protidias are already coming up against such UAVs, and Ukrainian defenders are trying to destroy them, - an emphasis.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Shaksa's night attack on Odesa region, these unmanned aircraft are designed to fly as low as possible. They are hidden from radar stations, thus difficult to detect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each drone can be programmed to a certain flight height and a route. Odessa is the Black Sea, so enemy troops have the opportunity to customize "Shahda" to the water surface. After all, when they fly to land, they are still destroyed by our anti-aircraft missile forces, ”Colonel Yurignat added.</li>

<li>These bombs pose a serious threat, because they can overcome the distance of up to 70 km. This depends on the height at which the aircraft rises. The higher the aircraft, the bomb will fly, because it is equipped with wings - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">told</a>Colonel Yuriy Ignati, spokesman for the Air Force forces of Ukraine during the "Uniform News" TEMACHAFON.</li>
</ul>
<p>The weight of such aviation bombs is 500 kg, which makes them quite powerful. If the enemy will use such ammunition, it can lead to the destruction of entire cities.</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw that the enemy did with Mariupol these bombs. Of course, they were not planning, but free fall, but unfortunately, at that time there was no Ukrainian air defense. Therefore, the occupation troops did everything they wanted with our city, ”the officer added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our defenders understand that the use of such planning bombing by the enemy will be new threats. They will not fly as accurately as the enemy would like, but over time, occupiers can refine it. Therefore, the risk remains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if these bombs get 20 or 30 kilometers from the line, it is still a very serious threat to our military personnel and prifrontoe cities. Three things that could drive away hostile planes from our border are Patriot, SAMP \ T and F-16 fighters. Unfortunately, we do not have any of the above equipment yet. Of course, Patriot Tasamp \ t will come to Ukraine soon, but we need to continue to tell the world, we need modern fighters, - said Colonel Yuri Ignat.</li>

<p>About it during a roundtable at the Military Media Center “Officers without weapons. The Institute of Military Chaplaincy in Ukraine: formation, mission, ecumenism” told Colonel Alexei Tereshchuk, Head of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Head of the Military Chaplaincy Service reported that according to the current law, a military chaplain may be a citizen of Ukraine, a representative of a religious organization that is registered in Ukraine in accordance with the current entry and has a mandate for the implementation of military-Kamplean activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>A mandate is like a license that is issued according to the need. The Armed Forces conducted a personnel survey and the quotas of the denominational representation of the military chaplains were determined. According to these quotas, each religious organization receives a request from the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedoms on the number of priests they should be delegated to the armed forces. They receive a mandate responsibly, and this enables them to carry out military-capeclarship activities,-said Alexei Tereshchuk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> He noted that there are 738 positions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As of today, the mandates have been issued to 244 clergymen, and 78 officers have been assigned to the staffing military chaplains. </strong> **</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the mandate does not yet indicate that the priest is immediately a become a military chaplain. There is a certain procedure, and today 78 -staffed military chaplains have been appointed, which received the military rank and signed the Contract. After appointment to the post, a military chaplain undergoes a special training. The preparation is not only in the pastoral care of or educational work, but also counseling, especially the commander, - said Alexei Tereshchuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The head of the military chaplaincy said that consulting is commanding a very important area of work of the Chaplain.</p>
<p>-When the unit enters the area of combat mission, as shown by the practitioner, it is very important for the commander to understand the spiritual and religious situation in the districts and among his personnel. In 2014, there were even cases where our crews on the streets stopped civilians with signs of religious surgical. This is a very important work of the military chaplain, ”Alexei Tereshchuk reported.</p>
<p>The event also noted that the military chaplain should meet the spiritual and religious needs of the personnel and, if necessary, involve a representative of another religious denomination.</p>

<p>Deputy Minister <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/614">reported</a>In her technology, that the technology of information campaigns regarding the "story" and conscript was always the same.</p>
<p>"To spin a story where the announcement was discharged with a disabled person, the deceased, the absence of World War II. The hero is always different, it is about the essence.</p>
<p>Or they distributed some wild text of the summons or questionnaire of the conscript.</p>
<p>We regularly denied it.</p>
<p>Now the enemy has a little complicated by its technology and adds stories about the amazing place of handing stories and "waves" of mobilization.</p>
<p>The goal is obvious. Discredit and disrupt the work of the shopping mall(Former troops).</p>

<p>He just turned to the Chile Parliament - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we want. It doesn't matter what the distance between our peoples. We appreciate life and protect the international order. We must deprive the hope of support in Latin America.</p>
<p>He also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time such a special appeal to the representatives of each state elected by citizens. He thanked them with the suspension, emphasizing how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing killing, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore an indirect life after the strikes of aggression.</p>
<p>He spent several international conversations today, talking to our partners.</p>
<p>He thanked Canada and personally Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau for unchanged support. For its next manifestation - financial assistance of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. In detail, we discussed in the battlefield and the security needs of our country.</p>
<p>To reject the enemy from our earth and thus finish this faster, we have to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples, as they agree with the chaos that Russian aggression brings the world.</p>
<p>He spoke to Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps of Vevrointegration, our joint measures, which we are preparing… a new sanction packaging, which must continue the pressure line on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.</p>
<p>Today, by the way, a historic event for our region, for the whole of Europe, the entire Euro -Atlantic community. Finland becomes a 31st NATO member.</p>
<p>I congratulate the entire people of Finland and personally Mr. President. With a reliable guarantee of security - a collective guarantee.</p>
<p>Russian aggression clearly proves: only collective guarantees, only prerequisite guarantees can be reliable. This is what we have always talked about. We also talk about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. We in the infect, what can be the speed of procedures.</p>
<p>By the way, NATO Summit in Vilnius deserves to be quite ambitious.</p>
<p>There will be a day when security will be guaranteed for our country.All day we are preparing for international events planned for this week. They are important, bold, ambitious. As this is a rule for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We keep in control and the internal situation, in particular about spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. To break Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside - no one.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who is in battle for Ukraine!Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Marinka Takrasnogorovka, every hot direction ... I thank you, warriors!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will note two decisions today.</p>
<p>The United States provides a 2 billion $ 600 million defense support package. The HIMARS Boobes for Air Defense, and Artillery, what is needed. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you, Congress, thank every American!</p>
<p>And the second solution. Today, the work of the Independent International Commission of the United Nations, which investigates Russian crimes against Ukrainians, has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the racists to the inevitable, fair responsibility.</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>Ukrinform publishes the text of the speech.</p>
<p>_ <strong> Congratulations, Warsaw!</strong> _</p>
<p>_ <strong> Congratulations, Poland!</strong> _</p>
<p>The great Polish people!The great Ukrainian people!Side by side here, united in this square with the spirit of freedom, a majestic history and a glorious transmission that we are approaching together!</p>
<p>We know each other, Ukrainians and Poles, and we know for a long time. And now the Ukrainian hearts are appealing to each of the Polish hearts in the Serrtsipolsk capital.</p>
<p>This is an honor for me - to be here. I speak to you with words of gratitude and strength. Fits, because there are no more such moments when we were different when we would not be united. Ukrainian and Polish hearts fight for one freedom, the assertive independence of our states, for our native Europe - our common house, and we will win!</p>
<p>There is no more such force that would outstand Ukrainian and Polish brotherhood. Azavs will come true: "We will take the power of a stranger from us, we will pick a saber."</p>
<p>We recalculate, brethren, and we are everywhere in our sides.</p>
<p>Every time the Ukrainian flag returns to the absolutely legitimate place of the scientific land, and the Russian occupier escapes, the Polish flag is also stronger.</p>
<p>Yellow-blue and white-red-these four colors are stronger than a hostile tricolor.</p>
<p>Every successful battle of Ukrainian heroes for our independent state adds protection to Polish independence. Polish "crabs" and "Peruns" in the hands of Ukrainians, who turn our people freedom, add strength to your freedom.</p>
<p>Here is what our skills, Ukrainians and Poles mean, to build our victoria side by side. And I am grateful for this brotherhood to every Pole!</p>
<p>Bow to you, Poland!Applause to you, the Polish people!</p>
<p>I am grateful to you, friend Andzeya, Mr. President. Your wife Agati. For mensity - to be here today with my wife.</p>
<p>To you, dear Mateushe, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mrs. Marshal and Mr Marshal. All Polish leaders are here, and everywhere in the communes and people of Poland, who know what our freedom means for your dreamer. I am grateful to all of you who are now on this square and who heard all over Poland!</p>
<p>Today I was on the Pilsudski Square, next to this place, where the words of the great man and the great Pole of John Paul II were heard where the great Pole and the great Pole. ”Free Poland appears and will never fall. Free Ukraine appears and never becomes.</p>
<p>But the alien authorities who wanted to control our peoples and did not understand what we would like to do, just crumbled. And we - we stand together!Side by side. Ukraine, and Europe, and the free world.</p>
<p>We stand and when the full -scale aggression forces against our freedom are thrown again. Well, this regime that went to war against us will fall. He brought the graves to Ukraine to then bring the graves to Poland and all our siblings again. And we fight. Side by side!</p>
<p>He brought deportation to Ukrainians to deport again and others whose freedom on the lands that Russia is about to steal. And we are defending ourselves. Side by side!</p>
<p>The enemy wanted to bury our independence with you and dissolve our national cultures in the Russian space. And we stand firm!We, and we, together, together, back side by side will return all this evil epitaph of Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>We with you, Poland, side by side will confirm freedom in Europe forever. Tyrania works in history when losing in Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and St. Petersburg will not be indivisible. Never again.</p>
<p>On this glorious square and on any other Polish Square, as well as the Ukrainian Maidans, there will never be Russia again-after our victory.</p>
<p>Do you still need steps towards her? No. It is only necessary not to stop in solidarity. When the battle requires artillery, it should be provided. When the victory needs tanks, their roar must sound on the front line. When independence needs air, you do not need to pay attention to how to react in Russia to the aircraft in us, it is not necessary to remember which number will have a safer look near the letter F - 16 or some more. It is worth doing!</p>
<p>To act in the same way as your leadership has shown itself in a tank coalition. I believe that it will also be in the aviation coalition. Because it is the battle for freedom, and it is partially in it.</p>
<p>When our ally, a powerful allies - President Biden, said in Warsaw in Warsaw, he said, "There is no sweeter word than" freedom ". There is no higher desire than freedom. "</p>
<p>We, Ukrainians and Poles, know it well. Therefore, there is no such question between us that we will not solve to strengthen our common protection. That is why this visit, the negotiations here in Warsaw became another step towards victory. And I thank you to settle the agreed today!For a powerful defensive package. Thank you for your lives, which we save with you in our solidarity!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Polish people!</strong>The more freedom we have with you, around us, the more guarantees there will be goodness. The fact that our common enemy will match. It will be rightly responsible for Bykivnia and Bucha, Katyn and Smolensk. It will fit the toink of your life here on earth, and forever - before God.</p>
<p>Justice will be the historical achievement of our generations, and is pursued in the same way our brotherhood. Ukrainians and Poles go-by-side.</p>
<p><strong> Brothers and sisters Poles!</strong></p>
<p>A few more generations, so, all that our strength is now based on was a lew.</p>
<p>Jerzy Gedroyts taught that "there is no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine." This is studied.</p>
<p>And I would continue. Do not win Russia in Europe when the Ukrainian and the Pole are standing. Let's study this.</p>
<p>And just as we are with you, Poland, we stand together in this war, Budmonian and peace. Together!Side by side in everything. Together in the European Union, together in NATO. This is the continuation of our fate of free peoples!</p>
<p>We have to support historical understanding between our peoples. Everyone!Everything that we need to solve for the interests and peace of our societies must be solved. The cooperation of the military and political, economic and energy doctrine of historians.</p>
<p>When we accept that human life is the highest value, we honor the memory of every person. All who lived in front of us. Anyone who needs respect. Itut should not be any prohibitions. It is our mutual and absolute respect that will carry Ukrainian and Polish culture. Always carry!Because we were always escaped by our unity, our determination.</p>
<p>Dear Rzeszow!I thank you for becoming the first rescuer for Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will go!Lublin!Helme!Thank you!You who have opened our people at a time when it was most needed!</p>
<p>Gdansk and Wroclaw!Katowice and Belostok!Krakow and Warsaw!Every city that has become so hospitable for our people!I thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you for the fact that Ukrainian children in Poland can live in respect, and the Ukrainian law has received a law from the Polish state, which guarantees them the same rights that have your people!</p>
<p>I thank all Poland volunteers - can volunteers be louder? - Who help people here on Polish land and in Ukraine, even risking their lives!</p>
<p>Thank you all who train Ukrainian soldiers on Polish land!</p>
<p>And thank you every Polish heart that raises their prayers as well as the Ukrainian!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainians in Poland!</strong>And I thank all of you who helps the state!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Poles!All Europeans!</strong></p>
<p>Wishing you happy coming Easter holidays!And everyone - victories of life with superstulation, victories in the battles, which continue in Ukraine now!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers who fight for ours and your freedom!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine Mykolasolsky said this, Ukrinform reports with reference to <a href="https://minagro.gov.ua/news/mikola-solskij-na-vartist-zerna-u-sviti-vplivaye-vijna-proti-ukrayini"></a>He noted that if the whole world community managed to squeeze Russia to increase inspections in Bosphorus, Ukraine could send several times more grain vessels per day. Accordingly, the flow of car transportation of Ukrainian grain in Europe could be reduced.</p>
<p>According to Solsky, exports are cheaper for the Ukrainian farmer, and therefore more profitable.</p>
<p>He stressed that Russia continues to artificially restrain the export of Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zerno"></a>by the sea, inhibiting the inspection of the Vuden in the Bosphorus. Only 2-3 ships are inspected. The minister explained that Ukrainian ports did not work at full capacity due to military aggression. Therefore, for the export of Ukrainian grain, we have to look for alternatives, including through Poland.</p>
<p>"Russia's war against Ukraine has influenced the whole world agricultural market. The aggressor country has created problems for both Ukrainian and Polish and consumers, not only in us, but also in Europe or Africa. And one major problems - It is a blocking of maritime routes of Ukrainian exports, " - said the head of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy.</p>
<p>He added that almost a year ago, the European Commission implemented the Overhanging initiative to establish alternative routes of exports of Ukrainian agro -products and imports of essential goods in the conditions of blockade of marine ports.</p>
<p>"It was a fierce support from Europe, including Poland, and this decision was to protect the critical interests of Ukrainian farmers. We continue to coal our markets, we for healthy competition and understand that allies should be comfortable to cooperate. Unfortunately, the war made its adjustments Fortunately, the Poles understand it, " - said Solsky.</p>

<p>Kovalchyk stated that he decided to leave the position through the decision of the European Commission to continue to duty -free import of Ukrainian grain by June 2024. Tariffs were made by Polish farmers.</p>
<p>Poland and other countries have offered assistance in transit of Ukrainian grain outside the markets after Russia has blocked traditional routes for post -scale -scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Polish farmers claim that grain remains in their countries, which leads to a decrease in prices.</p>

<p>"Ukraine and Poland will affirm freedom together in Europe forever. Tyrania loses Vistoria when it loses Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and St. Petersburg will never share more. After our victory on our and your Maidans will never be more than Russia," the head of the Ukrainian state said.</p>

<p>According to the intelligence service, the Kremlin architecture of influence in Latvia, which has been carefully built for many years, has actually collapsed - the environment of Russian "compatriots" is separated and inactive, its former "agent -floating" illuminated, so their effectiveness is now low. However, Russia will not attempt to have an external impact on Latvia and look for other, more effective tools.</p>
<p>The potential of Russia's influence in Latvia is maintained because of the favorable attitude of the aggressor state of some populations. In addition, Russia is trying to use people who doubt the need to support Ukraine for rejuvenation of funds in strengthening the safety of Latvia.</p>

This involves actions at different levels - at the level of persons who make political decisions, at the level of the military sector, as well as individuals who organize or provide support.</p>
<p>VDD stipulates that individuals, including Latvia citizens outside Ukraine, will play a more important role in Russia's activities in the implementation. The Russian Federation will use them as new "leaders of thoughts", contributing to their recognition and popularity in the Latvian pro -Kremlin society segment. In this context, it is also worthwhile to distinguish persons who have been educated in Russia or puppies. Among them is the search for regular performers of the Kremlin.Persons acting in favor of Russia will take a wait position and will conceal their views. These persons and part of the Kremlin -oriented society expect a favorable result of the war in Ukraine, hoping for the possibility of restoring former ties with Russia.</p>
<p>The VDD report also states that in some cases, the pro -Kremlivska tunes appeared in the street environment. From February 24, 2022 to the end of the year, VDDs with the State Police recorded just over a thousand incidents in various public places, which can be characterized as a demonstration of support <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-russian-aggression"></a>in Ukraine. The most obvious was the drawing of the letter "Z", hooliganism. At the same time, despite the episodic and depoodic incidents, last year there were no mass actions in Latvia last year, aimed at re -re -renovation of the war -resolved in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As a result of purposeful counter -measures, implemented by the special service, pro -Kremliv activists in 2022 could not mobilize like -minded people's protests or disobedience actions that would illegally express their support for the laws committed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels at a press conference, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"NATO's position is that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance. And this position is incomprehensible. But we know that in order to make it possible, we need to cut two things. One is that we must ensure that Ukraine rewresses as a sovereign independent the state. Of course, a meaningful discussion of pro -Ukraine as a member of the Alliance should be based on the fact that Ukraine is a democratic state -dependent state in Europe. And this is exactly what is not appealed and is not amazed by a cruel Russian invasion, "Stoltenberg said.</p>

<p>"The second we need to pay attention to is when this war will overcome IUkraine. Then, of course, we will need to ensure the highest operational compatibility when Ukraine will be able to move away from the standard Soviet era, doctrines, ways of functioning of its armed forces. This transition began But we need more. We need to realize it faster, "the Secretary General said.</p>
<p>According to him, the difference between the current support that the NATO Alliance provides Ukraine and the long -term care program is to meet the general needs. The Alliance, of course, provides weapons, military support, great number of non -military support, which is that it meets the urgent needs of Ukraine now. This program is more long -term. "It is the development of institutions, assistance in the transition, interaction, standards, doctrines, everything we need to have for membership," Stoltenberg said.</p>

<p>He stated this, speaking to the Ukrainian and Polish communities at the Plashchikorolovsky Castle in Warsaw, and thanks to the Poles for their support and assistance in the war with the aggressor, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"Ukraine and Poland will affirm freedom together in Europe forever. Tyrania loses Vistoria when it loses Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and St. Petersburg will never share more. After our victory on our and your Maidans will never be more than Russia," the head of the Ukrainian state said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-05T21-47-22-03-00/1680717214-559.jpg" />He emphasized that every time the Ukrainian flag returns to its law on Ukrainian soil, and the Russian occupier escapes, the Ipol flag is stronger. Yellow-blue and white-red-these four colors are stronger than the Obrosian tricolor.</p>

"Polish" crabs "and" Peruns "in the hands of Ukrainians who return freedom to our people, add strength and vice. That is what our skills - Ukrainians and Poles mean - build a winged story side by side, and I am grateful for this fraternity to every Pole for this brotherhood "," he said.</p>
<p>Zelensky reminded the prophetic words of Pope John Paul II of the Spirit of God, who will descend on our earth.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-04-05T21-47-22-03-00/1680717213-704.jpg" />He emphasized that it happened: Free Poland appeared and never fall, free Ukraine appeared and will never fall, and the Soviet regime crumbled. Taksamo, in his opinion, will happen to Russia.</p>
<p>"This alien power, who wanted to control our peoples and did not understand what we would like to do, just scattered. And we stand. We stand together side by side-Ukraine and Europe, both Europe, and the free world. Aggression against our freedom. This regime will also fall, which went to the war against us, "Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The head of state is convinced that as Ukrainians and Poles now oppose the Russian aggressor, so they will enjoy the world together, will be together in the NATO.</p>
<p>"It is a continuation of our fate of free peoples, historical understanding between our people should reinforce everyone - everything we need to solve for the interests of the Spirit of our societies, they must decide - from the cooperation of military and political, economic, energy to the hard work of historians," Zelensky.</p>

<p>The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine Mykolasolsky said this, Ukrinform reports with reference to <a href="https://minagro.gov.ua/news/mikola-solskij-na-vartist-zerna-u-sviti-vplivaye-vijna-proti-ukrayini"></a>He noted that if the whole world community managed to squeeze Russia to increase inspections in Bosphorus, Ukraine could send several times more grain vessels per day. Accordingly, the flow of car transportation of Ukrainian grain in Europe could be reduced.</p>
<p>According to Solsky, exports are cheaper for the Ukrainian farmer, and therefore more profitable.</p>
<p>He stressed that Russia continues to artificially restrain the export of Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zerno"></a>by the sea, inhibiting the inspection of the Vuden in the Bosphorus. Only 2-3 ships are inspected. The minister explained that Ukrainian ports did not work at full capacity due to military aggression. Therefore, for the export of Ukrainian grain, we have to look for alternatives, including through Poland.</p>
<p>"Russia's war against Ukraine has influenced the whole world agricultural market. The aggressor country has created problems for both Ukrainian and Polish and consumers, not only in us, but also in Europe or Africa. And one major problems - It is a blocking of maritime routes of Ukrainian exports, " - said the head of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy.</p>
<p>He added that almost a year ago, the European Commission implemented the Overhanging initiative to establish alternative routes of exports of Ukrainian agro -products and imports of essential goods in the conditions of blockade of marine ports.</p>
<p>"It was a fierce support from Europe, including Poland, and this decision was to protect the critical interests of Ukrainian farmers. We continue to coal our markets, we for healthy competition and understand that allies should be comfortable to cooperate. Unfortunately, the war made its adjustments Fortunately, the Poles understand it, " - said Solsky.</p>

<p>Kovalchyk stated that he decided to leave the position through the decision of the European Commission to continue to duty -free import of Ukrainian grain by June 2024. Tariffs were made by Polish farmers.</p>
<p>Poland and other countries have offered assistance in transit of Ukrainian grain outside the markets after Russia has blocked traditional routes for post -scale -scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Polish farmers claim that grain remains in their countries, which leads to a decrease in prices.</p>

<p>Ukrinform publishes the text of the speech.</p>
<p>_ <strong> Congratulations, Warsaw!</strong> _</p>
<p>_ <strong> Congratulations, Poland!</strong> _</p>
<p>The great Polish people!The great Ukrainian people!Side by side here, united in this square with the spirit of freedom, a majestic history and a glorious transmission that we are approaching together!</p>
<p>We know each other, Ukrainians and Poles, and we know for a long time. And now the Ukrainian hearts are appealing to each of the Polish hearts in the Serrtsipolsk capital.</p>
<p>This is an honor for me - to be here. I speak to you with words of gratitude and strength. Fits, because there are no more such moments when we were different when we would not be united. Ukrainian and Polish hearts fight for one freedom, the assertive independence of our states, for our native Europe - our common house, and we will win!</p>
<p>There is no more such force that would outstand Ukrainian and Polish brotherhood. Azavs will come true: "We will take the power of a stranger from us, we will pick a saber."</p>
<p>We recalculate, brethren, and we are everywhere in our sides.</p>
<p>Every time the Ukrainian flag returns to the absolutely legitimate place of the scientific land, and the Russian occupier escapes, the Polish flag is also stronger.</p>
<p>Yellow-blue and white-red-these four colors are stronger than a hostile tricolor.</p>
<p>Every successful battle of Ukrainian heroes for our independent state adds protection to Polish independence. Polish "crabs" and "Peruns" in the hands of Ukrainians, who turn our people freedom, add strength to your freedom.</p>
<p>Here is what our skills, Ukrainians and Poles mean, to build our victoria side by side. And I am grateful for this brotherhood to every Pole!</p>
<p>Bow to you, Poland!Applause to you, the Polish people!</p>
<p>I am grateful to you, friend Andzeya, Mr. President. Your wife Agati. For mensity - to be here today with my wife.</p>
<p>To you, dear Mateushe, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mrs. Marshal and Mr Marshal. All Polish leaders are here, and everywhere in the communes and people of Poland, who know what our freedom means for your dreamer. I am grateful to all of you who are now on this square and who heard all over Poland!</p>
<p>Today I was on the Pilsudski Square, next to this place, where the words of the great man and the great Pole of John Paul II were heard where the great Pole and the great Pole. ”Free Poland appears and will never fall. Free Ukraine appears and never becomes.</p>
<p>But the alien authorities who wanted to control our peoples and did not understand what we would like to do, just crumbled. And we - we stand together!Side by side. Ukraine, and Europe, and the free world.</p>
<p>We stand and when the full -scale aggression forces against our freedom are thrown again. Well, this regime that went to war against us will fall. He brought the graves to Ukraine to then bring the graves to Poland and all our siblings again. And we fight. Side by side!</p>
<p>He brought deportation to Ukrainians to deport again and others whose freedom on the lands that Russia is about to steal. And we are defending ourselves. Side by side!</p>
<p>The enemy wanted to bury our independence with you and dissolve our national cultures in the Russian space. And we stand firm!We, and we, together, together, back side by side will return all this evil epitaph of Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>We with you, Poland, side by side will confirm freedom in Europe forever. Tyrania works in history when losing in Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and St. Petersburg will not be indivisible. Never again.</p>
<p>On this glorious square and on any other Polish Square, as well as the Ukrainian Maidans, there will never be Russia again-after our victory.</p>
<p>Do you still need steps towards her? No. It is only necessary not to stop in solidarity. When the battle requires artillery, it should be provided. When the victory needs tanks, their roar must sound on the front line. When independence needs air, you do not need to pay attention to how to react in Russia to the aircraft in us, it is not necessary to remember which number will have a safer look near the letter F - 16 or some more. It is worth doing!</p>
<p>To act in the same way as your leadership has shown itself in a tank coalition. I believe that it will also be in the aviation coalition. Because it is the battle for freedom, and it is partially in it.</p>
<p>When our ally, a powerful allies - President Biden, said in Warsaw in Warsaw, he said, "There is no sweeter word than" freedom ". There is no higher desire than freedom. "</p>
<p>We, Ukrainians and Poles, know it well. Therefore, there is no such question between us that we will not solve to strengthen our common protection. That is why this visit, the negotiations here in Warsaw became another step towards victory. And I thank you to settle the agreed today!For a powerful defensive package. Thank you for your lives, which we save with you in our solidarity!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Polish people!</strong>The more freedom we have with you, around us, the more guarantees there will be goodness. The fact that our common enemy will match. It will be rightly responsible for Bykivnia and Bucha, Katyn and Smolensk. It will fit the toink of your life here on earth, and forever - before God.</p>
<p>Justice will be the historical achievement of our generations, and is pursued in the same way our brotherhood. Ukrainians and Poles go-by-side.</p>
<p><strong> Brothers and sisters Poles!</strong></p>
<p>A few more generations, so, all that our strength is now based on was a lew.</p>
<p>Jerzy Gedroyts taught that "there is no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine." This is studied.</p>
<p>And I would continue. Do not win Russia in Europe when the Ukrainian and the Pole are standing. Let's study this.</p>
<p>And just as we are with you, Poland, we stand together in this war, Budmonian and peace. Together!Side by side in everything. Together in the European Union, together in NATO. This is the continuation of our fate of free peoples!</p>
<p>We have to support historical understanding between our peoples. Everyone!Everything that we need to solve for the interests and peace of our societies must be solved. The cooperation of the military and political, economic and energy doctrine of historians.</p>
<p>When we accept that human life is the highest value, we honor the memory of every person. All who lived in front of us. Anyone who needs respect. Itut should not be any prohibitions. It is our mutual and absolute respect that will carry Ukrainian and Polish culture. Always carry!Because we were always escaped by our unity, our determination.</p>
<p>Dear Rzeszow!I thank you for becoming the first rescuer for Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will go!Lublin!Helme!Thank you!You who have opened our people at a time when it was most needed!</p>
<p>Gdansk and Wroclaw!Katowice and Belostok!Krakow and Warsaw!Every city that has become so hospitable for our people!I thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you for the fact that Ukrainian children in Poland can live in respect, and the Ukrainian law has received a law from the Polish state, which guarantees them the same rights that have your people!</p>
<p>I thank all Poland volunteers - can volunteers be louder? - Who help people here on Polish land and in Ukraine, even risking their lives!</p>
<p>Thank you all who train Ukrainian soldiers on Polish land!</p>
<p>And thank you every Polish heart that raises their prayers as well as the Ukrainian!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainians in Poland!</strong>And I thank all of you who helps the state!</p>
<p><strong> Dear Poles!All Europeans!</strong></p>
<p>Wishing you happy coming Easter holidays!And everyone - victories of life with superstulation, victories in the battles, which continue in Ukraine now!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers who fight for ours and your freedom!</p>

<p>This was stated by Vice president of the US Peace Institute, the former US Ambassador to Ukraine Taylor in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2D_SYy7Wms&amp;ab_channel=UKRLIFE.TV"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“I believe that within the US government there is an understanding of the goal in the Russian war of anti -Ukraine. It is that it is to return the peace in which the rule of law and the law prevails. And for this to happen, Russia must be expelled from Ukraine, Russian should be taken from Ukrainian land. It is a very clear and understandable children of the President of the Zelensky and Ukrainian people. Therefore, everything is simple - to gather from Ukraine.

<p>He noted that US goals could not always be voiced, mostly mentioned in an interview or at press conferences.</p>
<p>“When officials make statements, many factors are weighed. Cestos of any power-my country, yours.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T26-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj.jpeg" />Mr. Head of the Senate, Mr. Head of the House of Deputies!</p>
<p>Thank you for your words, for such a good greeting.</p>
<p>I see our flag in you. Thank you for respect for our flag, our hymn, to my state!</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Dear members of the National Congress of Chile, Dear Representatives and representatives of theiplomatic corps, dear journalists!</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Let me start my appeal from one story. From the story of the place in which the children were drawing.</p>
<p>Ordinary children, but unusual drawings. On the walls. At school. In the basement.</p>
<p>In the village of Yaidny in our Chernihiv region, where Russian soldiers were transformed a regular rural school for a concentration camp.</p>
<p>They drove all the villagers there. All!In the basement. Children and adults. Of completely years old people. Women and men. Less than 200 square meters per 360 people.</p>
<p>You may have not heard of this place yet. But I want to tell you about him.</p>
<p>To tell about the walls of this basement in the berry, on which the children painted that any children in any country: friends, relatives, their lives, their rivers, football players, other of their heroes.</p>
<p>The children tried to write the lines of our hymn, which just sounded here, the lines on the walls ... And the adults were calculating. Also on the walls. How many days ago, the basement and how many people were killed, not withstanding these conditions. Their cutters are still on those walls. I was there yesterday, I saw it all.</p>
<p>From the third to March 30 last year, the concentration camp in the berry existed.</p>
<p>At the beginning, people were still released outside. One at a time. Sometimes. At least in the toilet.</p>
<p>And then they were deprived of it. No minute of the sun and the sky. The basement of the basement, crushing, dust and bucket instead of the toilet.</p>
<p>We know exactly about the ten dead there. People just couldn't stand it. Know about those who were then shot in the village, who disappeared.</p>
<p>And I do not want to talk public now that the occupiers started to do, the outlings said that the dead had to be buried.</p>
<p>It was hell on the ground. Hell that came to Ukraine with the Russian army.</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhere on your continent, in some countries there are still positive nostalgic memories about the period of relations with the Soviet Union or the tour, which it pretended to be after 1991. But now this concentration camp characterizes who we are dealing with.</p>
<p>Why did you need such bullying? What could be a motive to keep the whole village in inhumane conditions in the basement?And when we turn to weapons partners, we only turn out. And nearly 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages, our soldiers managed to liberate the Occupation. Berry - among them.</p>
<p>Many villages, towns and cities have experienced even worse mockery. They are just burned.</p>
<p>Imagine a once strong village, for example, the post-Pokrovsky Kherson region of Ukraine, in which more than 2 thousand people lived, and now almost all homes are broken. If it is accurate, 96% of damage to shelling. That's it that Russia came!</p>
<p>Imagine when there are only 50 such almost completely broken by war in the region alone.</p>
<p>Imagine a city that has been famous for decades with its industry, with your naval port. And now the city is dead. Killed by Russia. This is our Mariupol.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-1.jpeg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T26-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-1-150x150.jpeg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-2.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T26-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-2-150x150.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zelenskyj-3.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T26-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-3-150x150.jpeg" /></a>Imagine one of the greatest Ukrainian values, one of the greatest human values - fertile fields that have been welfare for centuries. In the south country, in the east as well.</p>
<p>The fields that are now contaminated with Russian mines. Often, Russian missiles are protruding from this earth from the volley fire systems, reminding that one state's aggression against another cannot be justified.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Almost 1900 Ukrainian cities and villages should be liberated from Russian evil!</p>
<p>This is why we have created a coalition of countries that help Ukraine's defeat national independence and the lives of our people.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I offered the formula of peace last fall - ten points that can return Ukraine to Ukraine, and to all of Europe and all over the world - stability, violated by Russian fascism.</p>
<p>This is what we seek support to you - to the Chilean people.</p>
<p>Life has the same value everywhere. The highest value. There is nothing that could have been liable to destroy the lives of peaceful people, the humiliation of peaceful people, the subjugation of free peoples and robbery attacks on other states for profit.</p>
<p>I am grateful to you, Republic Chile, for the fundamental condemnation of Russian aggression, with the support of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly.We form a global coalition to accomplish this and other similar tasks. And he is Yapti that we will fulfill them.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the world can not be the norm of burning cities and villages. There can be no normative, which someone wants to keep people in obedience. There can be no norm -concentration or filtration camps where people are driven and where people die.</p>
<p>The norms of wars as Russia now leads to Ukraine. And so, Russia itself, which it became, cannot and will not be the norm. It is a fascist state. State-Zlo. A state that deserves the legitimate and justification of the world is an attitude as a criminal.</p>
<p>Chilean people!</p>
<p>Ukraine invites you to join our peacekeeping efforts. Your voice in the Uonna Support for the Restoration of Ukraine's Security and Territorial Integrity is always very important.</p>
<p>Your participation in the implementation of our peace formula - which may not be a mere -human mineral demining - will accurately add an international order based on the rules.</p>
<p>I invite you to maintain our efforts for the food security of the world. This depends on the joint actions of all countries!</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the giant areas of our land are contaminated with mines or there are shelling, because Russia is blocking our ports and sea transportation to the Sea, the food market is destabilized.</p>
<p>We managed to unlock some of the supply. But the world needs more. Simply that the volume on the market and food prices on all continents are stable. You can be the leader of stabilization efforts from your continent!</p>
<p>Please support the efforts of the International Criminal Court, which has recently issued a warrant for the arrest of a Russian dictator in the case of the violent deportation of Ukrainian children into Russia and attempts to destroy their identity through assimilation and illegal adoption. With living relatives!</p>
<p>There is no such a crime that Russia would not have committed, conducting this war.</p>
<p>And there is no such people who could remain indifferent or neutral to evil.</p>
<p>Because we are all people. We all want the children of our peoples to be happy, security. They studied and rejoiced in life, not painted on the walls in captivity, in the cellars.</p>
<p>I thank you for your attention!Thank you for your support!</p>
<p>Let the dictatorship always lose, and life - always wins!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This opinion in an interview with the publication <a href="https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/politics/reznikov-pro-kontrnastup-viyskova-dopomoga-ti-tayming-virishalni-dlya-peremogi-interv-yu-50315526.html">NV</a>Defense Minister of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov.</p>
<p>According to the Minister of Defense, this war is a war of resources, and although they decline on both sides, Ukraine has powerful resource support from 50 countries of Ramstein Club members who wish it victory, and believe that it is a lane. The second favorable factor for Ukraine is the information component - the civilized world feels its emotional involvement in this war because of the crimes of the occupation troops in Bucha, Izium, Mariupol and Balakliya.</p>
<ul>
<li>People feel their emotional involvement in this war that they can float on it, I am no longer talking about modern technologies that allow you to put on the stroke and balance the lack of living strength. I think this war is fast. Of course, I would like it to begin, but personally I believed this year, as in the year of victory, - the head of the defense department assured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>*</em>* Other important abstracts with interview with the Minister of Defense: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Russia begins to lack resources - human, high -precision weapons and artillery ammunition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously, they poured us up to 60 thousand shells on our head, now, undoubtedly, the front line narrowed, but they started to beat less, only 20-30 thousand supply. Intelligence reports that our partners confirm that they run through the year to North Korea, China and other countries according to artillery and armored vehicles. Even from Belarus, they removed all heavy weapons, - said Alexei Reznikov.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Minister predicts that the US entry into the election campaign will not affect Ukraine's support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, during American primaries and races there will be noticeable Ukrainian rhetoric in some politicians who dream of business with the Kremlin asusual. But all the same, I think that the one who will support the idea that will be proud of the victory of Ukraine. Because the US is the main partner of this winner, and this victory is quite achievable, - the Minister of Defense notes.</p>

<p>Russian invaders continue to actively destroy the natural resource potential of temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.</p>
<p>This was stated by Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/616">telegrams</a>.</p>
<p>«З початку окупації російськими підприємствами було організовано заготівлюлісу у Запорізькій, Херсонській та інших тимчасово окупованих областяхУкраїни. При цьому підприємцями здійснюється неконтрольована варварськавирубка лісових насаджень, що у разі її продовження невідворотно призведе докатастрофічних наслідків для екології», — зазначила вона.</p>
<p>Ганна Маляр наголосила, що більшість лісових масивів у південному регіоніштучного походження і вони спеціально створювались для захисту від вітрової,ґрунтової та водної ерозії, виконуючи функцію рекреаційних талісомеліоративних насаджень.</p>
<p>«Разом з цим, протягом останньої декади березня ц. р. у районі Маріуполязафіксовано інтенсивне переміщення автошляхами Е105 та М18 колон російськихвантажних автомобілів, завантажених свіжозрубаним лісом-кругляком», —повідомила заступник Міністра оборони України.</p>
<p>Крім того, акцентує Ганна Маляр, у деяких населених пунктах ТОТ Україниросійське командування заборонило місцевому населенню здійснюватисільськогосподарські роботи на полях, що, ймовірно, призведе до зривуцьогорічної весняної посівної кампанії, а в надалі — занедбаннясільськогосподарських угідь.</p>

<p>Russia not to win in Europe when Ukrainian and Pole stand side by side-a protrusion of the president of Ukraine before the deputies of both chambers of the National Assembly, representatives of the public of Ukraine and Poland:</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Warsaw!</p>
<p>Congratulations, Poland!</p>
<p>The great Polish people!The great Ukrainian people!Side by side here, united in this square with the spirit of freedom, a majestic history and a glorious transmission that we are approaching together!</p>
<p>We know each other, Ukrainians and Poles, and we know for a long time. And now the Ukrainian hearts are appealing to each of the Polish hearts in the Serrtsipolsk capital.</p>
<p>This is an honor for me - to be here. I speak to you with words of gratitude and strength. Fits, because there are no more such moments when we were different when we would not be united. Ukrainian and Polish hearts fight for one freedom, the default independence of our states, for our native Europe - our common house, and we will win!</p>
<p>There is no more such force that would outstand Ukrainian and Polish brotherhood. Azavs will come true: "We will take the power of a stranger from us, we will pick a saber."</p>
<p>We recalculate, brethren, and we are everywhere in our sides.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2c94aa12eb09c8f77fd3b824b939b885_1680724194_extra_large.jpeg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-05T96-00-00-04-00/2c94aa12eb09c8f77fd3b824b939b885_1680724194_extra_large-150x150.jpeg)</a></p>

<p>Yellow-blue and white-red-these four colors are stronger than a hostile tricolor.</p>
<p>Every successful battle of Ukrainian heroes for our independent state adds protection to Polish independence. Polish "crabs" and "Peruns" in the hands of Ukrainians, who turn our people freedom, add strength to your freedom.</p>
<p>Here is what our skills, Ukrainians and Poles mean, to build our victoria side by side. And I am grateful for this brotherhood to every Pole!</p>
<p>Bow to you, Poland!Applause to you, the Polish people!To you, dear Mateushe, Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ms Marsalek and Mr Marshal. All Polish leaders are here, and everywhere in the communes and people of Poland, who know what our freedom means for your dreamer. I am grateful to all of you who are now on this square and who heard all over Poland!</p>
<p>Today I was on the Pilsudski Square, next to this place, where the words of the great man and the great Pole of John Paul II were heard where the great Pole and the great Pole. ”</p>
<p>Today it is obvious how generous the Lord was when he heard these words.</p>
<p>Free Poland appears and will never fall. Free Ukraine appears and never becomes.</p>
<p>But the alien authorities who wanted to control our peoples and did not understand what we would like to do, just crumbled. And we - we stand together!Side by side. Ukraine, and Europe, and the free world.</p>
<p>We stand and when the full -scale aggression forces against our freedom are thrown again. Well, this regime that went to war against us will fall. He brought the graves to Ukraine to then bring the graves to Poland and all our siblings again. And we fight. Side by side!</p>
<p>He brought deportation to Ukrainians to deport again and others whose freedom on the lands that Russia is about to steal. And we are defending ourselves. Side by side!</p>
<p>The enemy wanted to bury our independence with you and dissolve our national cultures in the Russian space. And we stand firm!We, and we, together, together, back side by side will return all this evil epitaph of Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>We with you, Poland, side by side will confirm freedom in Europe forever. Tyrania works in history when losing in Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and St. Petersburg will not be indivisible. Never again.</p>
<p>On this glorious square and on any other Polish Square, just like the Ukrainian Maidans, there will never be Russia again-after our victory.</p>
<p>Do you still need steps towards her? No. It is only necessary not to stop in solidarity. When the battle requires artillery, it should be provided. When the victory needs tanks, their roar must sound on the front line. When independence requires air, you do not need to pay attention to how to react in Russia to the planes in us, it is not necessary to remember which number will have a safer look near the letter F - 16 or some more. It is worth doing!</p>
<p>To act in the same way as your leadership has shown in a tank coalition. I believe that it will also be in the aviation coalition. Because it is the battle for freedom, and it is partially in it.We, Ukrainians and Poles, know it well. Therefore, there is no such question between us that we will not solve to strengthen our common protection. That is why this visit, the negotiations here in Warsaw became another step towards victory. And I thank you to settle the agreed today!For a powerful defensive package. Thank you for your lives, which we save with you in our solidarity!</p>
<p>Dear Polish people!</p>
<p>I am sure, you know that solidarity now covers much more than the fate of our two peoples. When we are free, it is a guarantee that freedom will be strong ears of our neighboring countries in the European Union. Romania and Slovakia, Lithuania and Other Balticia… All are stronger when we are free. When we are free, it is a guarantee, it will stand in Moldova, will not leave Georgia and come, will definitely come in the Villorus.</p>
<p>The more freedom we have with you, around us, the more guarantees there will be goodness. The fact that our common enemy will match. It will be rightly responsible for Bykivnia and Bucha, Katyn and Smolensk. It will answer the toink of your life here on earth, and forever - before God.</p>
<p>Justice will be the historical achievement of our generations, and is pursued in the same way our brotherhood. Ukrainians and Poles go-by-side.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters Poles!</p>
<p>A few more generations, so, all that our strength is now based on was a lew.</p>
<p>Jerzy Gedroyts taught that "there is no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine." This is studied.</p>
<p>And I would continue. Do not win Russia in Europe when the Ukrainian and the Pole are standing. Let's study this.</p>
<p>And just as we are with you, Poland, we stand together in this war, Budmonian and peace. Together!Side by side in everything. Together in the European Union, together in NATO. This is the continuation of our fate of free peoples!</p>
<p>We have to support historical understanding between our peoples. Everyone!Everything that we need to solve for the interests and peace of our societies must be solved. The cooperation of the military and political, economic and energy doctrine of historians.</p>
<p>When we accept that human life is the highest value, we honor the memory of every person. All who lived in front of us. Anyone who needs respect. Itut should not be any prohibitions. It is our mutual and absolute respect that will carry Ukrainian and Polish culture. Always carry!Because we were always escaped by our unity, our determination.</p>
<p>Dear Rzeszow!I thank you for becoming the first rescuer for Ukraine!Gdansk and Wroclaw!Katowice and Belostok!Krakow and Warsaw!Every city that has become so hospitable for our people!I thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you for the fact that Ukrainian children in Poland can live in respect, and the Ukrainian law has received a law from the Polish state, which guarantees them the same rights that have your people!</p>
<p>I thank all Poland volunteers - can volunteers be louder? - Who help people here on Polish land and in Ukraine, even at risk!</p>
<p>Thank you all who train Ukrainian soldiers on Polish land!</p>
<p>And thank you every Polish heart that raises their prayers as well as the Ukrainian!</p>
<p>Dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainians in Poland!</p>
<p>We work every day to expel the enemy from Ukraine to return the safety of our cities and villages, so that our people who find shelter in other countries can return home.</p>
<p>And I thank all of you who helps the state!</p>
<p>Dear Poles!All Europeans!</p>
<p>Wishing you happy coming Easter holidays!And everyone - victories of life with superstition, victories in the battles, which continue in Ukraine now!</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers who fight for ours and your freedom!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>
<p>Chwała Polsce!”.</p>
