Russia has completely stopped the registration of the new fleet from June 26, which testifies to the pro -the same to disrupt food supply to the world markets.

About it [reports](https://m.facebook.com/Ministry.for.restoration?eav=AfYQSzuFdOBCeayfHSu7eUbQLG_UzqeHJArpE2MYW65UCEXvCAlar2VZRerx2UP3YTw&paipv=0)Ministry of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.

29 ships that have to export 1.4 million tons of food mainly for the 5 countries of Asia and Africa, including China, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, blocked by Russia in Turkey's territorial waters.

In June, only 2 million tons were exported from Ukrainian ports. Another 1 million tons of food will either load or have already been partially loaded on 13 ships - the last registered in the initiative. If you do not restore the registration, the grain agreement will be completely stopped.

In 11 months, 45 countries received 32.5 million tons of food. An additional 25 million tons of tonnes did not receive the world due to sabotage. But even with these indicators, according to the UN, it was possible to reduce the world prices for food by 22%. This is a direct evidence that the grain agreement is needed by the world.

We support a statement of the Joint Coordination Center that all parties should be adequately accessed by vessels for food export, because it is a food danger to the entire world market. Only joint guns is able to stop Russia's food.

We urge partners under the agreement and all countries of the civilized world to defend the right to food. Ukraine, for its part, will also defend the right of a prominent trade navigation, which is recorded in international conventions.

Kabanchuk expressed this opinion at a press conference on "Situation in Belarus: Military and Political Challenges", Ukrinform correspondent reports.

He noted that there is always a threat to Ukraine by Belarus, and they always plan their actions based on the worst scenario.

“The worst scenario for Ukraine was in February 2022, when the columns of Novistomel and Kiev were going. This can be repeated if the grouping group is created. When ["Wagnerivtsi"](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-pvk-vagnera)will be concentrated there(In Belarus. - Ed.)In the amount they call- about 8,000 people, they can be added to them several tens of thousands of military Russian army, 10,000 people from the Belarusian army- and the track of a group for invasion of Ukraine.

_ ** I wish health, dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!** _

First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.

I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: more than 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and infant winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.

During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was posthumous to him.By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!

In today's conversation with Mr. Chancellor, we focused, of course, on further cooperation, as well as on strategic issues in the protection of our Europe - Europe, which can only be peaceful when peace will be guaranteed for it with complete security. There may be no security deficit in Europe that will provoke Russian tyranny and aggression. Russia will try to bite one or another piece of Europe only when it will see the other security uncertainty. When everything is defined and obvious, Russian -sized does not dare to break security.

Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.

We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.

And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.

Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!

It is especially worth noting today the junior lieutenant Alexander Pavlov, commander of the Marine infantry platoon of the 36th Brigade of Marines. His confident trick actions, skillful management in battle give good results to the state. Thank you!

The crew of the T-80 tank under the command of the junior sergeant Andrei Marchuk-thankmed and courage!This is the 36th brigade of the Marines.

And from the 35th brigade I will note today the commander of the tank, the junior sergeant Artmamatobrazka-thank you for the true Ukrainian courage and skill in the possession of the settlement Makarivka. Thank you, Artem!

Senior soldier Eugene Poddubny, sapper of the 47th mechanized brigade. It operates on a very hot direction and performs its tasks very effectively. Thank you, Eugene!The Mariinsky Direction ... Artillery Division under the command of Lieutenant Lukjianova does not give the occupiers a single minute of rest. Your combatants are really significant!Thank you!

Thank you all who are in battle now, at combat posts and positions!Thank you everyone who helps!

And one more.

The world today saw the Kremlin - unfortunately, by the hands of the current power of Georgia - kills a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili. Human life is the highest value and cannot be allowed to destroy Michael. Ukraine has urged the power of Georgia to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and the skipartners offered various rescue options of Michael. Today, I am the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to summon Ambassador of Georgia to Ukraine, expressed in a protest and propose to leave Ukraine for the next 48 hours for consultation with my capital. Once again I urge the Georgian power to convey to Ukraine a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili for necessary treatment and care. And I urge our partners to turn, not to ignore the cavity and save this person. No authorities in Europe have the right to execute people, life is a basic European value.

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

He told about it [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101768)Military expert Alexeygetman, Ukrinform reports.

According to him, during the passing week, the situation on the front was significantly invariable. But this does not mean that the offensive of the Armed Forces has been suspended or does not have any successes.

"The Armed Forces of the Armed Forces are enemy rear, destroying up to 30 enemy artillery per day. With such a rate per month of the Armed Forces can reduce the possibility of an enemy in artillery per month. Not from the point of view of the number of scales, but with respect to the number of artisms," the hetman said.

"So far, the main forces we planned to apply in this operation are unburdened. We bleed the enemy rear, destroy its warehouses, infrastructure, various logistics routes, and destroy high -artillery systems in the counter -battery struggle - up to 30 units of their artillery. They use artillery systems, then with such temples, we can at least a few weeks or a month in half their opportunities in artillery. Not from the point of view of the number of shots, because they remain shells, but in relation to the number of artillery systems from which they can fire " , - the hetman explained.

However, the expert noted that the defensive structures of the invaders are more powerful than during the Second World War. In addition, the enemy has the ability to replace them with differential.** Read also: ** [About 180 thousand Russian soldiers are concentrated in eastern Ukraine - ** Cleam **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3731011-na-shodi-ukraini-zoseredzeni-blizko-180-tisac-rosijskih-soldativ-cerevatij.html)The enemy intensified the Swativ Front for distraction, adds a military expert. A similar situation in the Lyman and Kupyansk directions.

"Overseas and Ukrainian analysts suggest that the main directions of our complementary actions should be in the south, so that we have taken to the coast of the Azov Sea through Melitopol Tatyansk and were able to cut the temporary-heated Crimea and those enemy groups from Federation. That is, on the land, then, which they punched at the beginning of a full -scale invasion, "hetman emphasized.

At the same time, the analyst is convinced that the Russians have no strength and means for recent promotion.

"When we say that they are throwing certain reserves, we need to understand that in the middle of Russia, they have no second army in the rear, there are no reserves that they can attach to strengthen their defense or in some areas of the counter -offensive.97% Front. They are moving their troops along the front and in the hottest destinations. Hetman.

At the same time, the Armed Forces occupied a certain bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper and kept it.

Botulism is an acute infectious disease. It occurs as a result of the use of products poisoned by toxins produced by bacteria-diseases of the disease. This toxin is one of the strongest from all known biological poisons.

The pathogen is resistant to external factors. Ignoring the disease or untimely treatment can lead to paralysis and even death.

Botulism has no epidemic potential because it is not transmitted from a person of a doll.

Other components of defense forces work: large -caliber machine guns, anti -aircraft guns, and MAZRK. The role of air defense is played by fighters. However, Ignati noted that if it were F-16 and not MiG-29, the efficiency would have increased many times.

“There are days when more, there are days when less. If we have not died for three days, it does not mean that we need to relax, and they have changed, ”he stressed.

Otherwise, the victory value will be extremely high," the minister stressed.

Reznikov stressed that Ukraine should develop domestic MIC, and representatives of the states should create opportunities, not problems for business.

He expressed confidence that in this particular situation with the claims of the audit "we will find a solution and protect the interests of the domestic business.

It is generally recognized that the armed forces of Sweden are compatible with other NATO countries. Sweden has a permanent representation in NATO and is considered a close partner of the Alliance, that is, the country's accession to the organization should be relatively simple.

But Turkey - the second largest armed forces, the Alliance's military force - blocks Sweden's entry for a number of reasons.

Among them is the statement that Sweden allows members of Kurdish terrorist groups to operate in the country, especially the militant workers' Party of Kardistan(RPK).

The interlocutors of the publication said that in June, the largest buyer of Russian Syroinaft in the country of Indian Oil became the first state oil refinery to pay for some parties of Russian oil in Yuan.

At least two of the three large private refineries of India are also paid for part of Russian imports in Yuan.

At the same time, none of India's private refineries - Reliance Industries, supported by Russia by Nayara Energy and HPCl Mittal Energy, were not answered to the Reuters about comments. Indian Oil also ignored the comment request.

The increase in payments in Yuan has pushed Beijing's efforts to internationalize the currency, since Chinese banks lobby for its use almost exclusively for Russian oil trade.The import of Russian crude oil in India has grown to record indicators in May, with Russian raw materials 40% of the total import of oil in India comparable to 16.5% earlier. Due to the cheaper oil from the Russian Federation, India decreases from Iraq and Saudi Arabia.

While Western sanctions against Moscow do not recognize, and the purchase of non -non -non -disruption may not be violated, Indian banks are cautious about such import payments.

In May, the State Bank of India, the main lender of the country and the key banker for the state oil refineries, rejected the request of Indian Oil on the payment of the cargo for the cargo delivered by "Rosneftia".

In June, Indian Oil took advantage of the services of the private Indian Creditor Bank to regulate trade with "Rosneft" by paying the supplier of the Uhayani Yuan. Some private Indian oil refineries also use a similar mechanism for calculations for Russian oil.

It is expected that the scheme of payments with Russian suppliers in Yuan will continue to be used.

As reported by Ukrinform, the United States believes that the establishment of a margin for Russian oil in the international market works effectively and expects [India will continue to buy energy from Russians accordingly(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3725520-ssa-ocikuut-so-india-prodovzit-zakupati-rosijsku-naftu-za-obmezenimi-cinami.html).

This was announced at a meeting with journalists at the Brussels Headquarters of NATO by NATO Military Committee Admiral Rob Bauer, Correspondenttukinform reports.

“As the NATO Secretary General said, we have the risk of a special land space. If Ukraine loses this war, it will only be a greater instability. The Russians want to return(its influence - ed.)Back to the 1997 borders, which includes three Baltic countries, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria. This is unacceptable to us. We need to realize that this war is not just about Ukraine. It is a lot more.

Their replenishment is a responsibility, above all, NATO member states, which should evaluate their own and take into account the volume of order in industry.

At the same time, according to the head of the NATO Military Committee, it is not necessary to underestimate the Russian potential of Russia, which it is able to restore and cause a new attack.

“The Russian army, especially its land troops, is now 90% involved in the wars of Ukraine. I don't think they have enough strength for something else. But Mandican that the Russians will be able to recover, so all our plans are based on the state of the state of the Russian army, which he was before Russia's attack against Ukraine. The same, they(Russians)They will take lessons from this war as well. Therefore, we continue to consider Russia as a serious threat to marine and especially in the air components. They also have great space in space and nuclear forces, ”the Admiral said.He added that Russia is currently cautious about NATO, as it is "very, very busy" in Ukraine. Therefore, it will take the Russian army, probably several years to restore their offensive potential. Sometimes the Alliance and Union countries should be used to determine the more detachment of defense capabilities and positioning of forces.

It is not noted what the Japanese rules may differ from the rules. However, according to the source, the softer approach of Japan can overshadow the efforts aimed at setting their rules as a world standard.

This week, the European Commissar, Tierry Breton will visit Tokyo to promote an approach to developing the rules in the field of AI, as well as to deepen cooperation in industry.

“Let's look forward for years, and let's try to imagine what Europe will look like. We can imagine that the European Union will be without Ukraine, without Moldova, the unknown Balkans, and that these parts of Europe will be influenced by Russia or China? It is impossible. So, the direction of our movement is clear. We now need to start what Europe will be when these countries will become part of the European Union, ”said Ursula von Der Lyen.

All these changes will need time, so you need to consider them now.

"Although the reconstruction of the spare transmission line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear security and safety on the facility," Grossi said.

The connection of the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye to a single line of transmission of 330 kV was interrupted on March 1 due to damage to another Berezidvipr. The connection was restored only on the evening of July 1.

“Reconnecting line 330kv is important because in the last few months [ZPES](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zaporizka-aes)It relied on a single main line of 750 kV for submission from external electricity required for cooling the reactor and other important functions of nuclear safety, ”the statement said.

The main purpose of the event is to build a bridge between Ukrainian and Dutch cultures and create a common space for the arts and interaction of both communities.

At the end of the first day of the event, there was a panel discussion between the leaders of public thought on the topic of culture, national identity, social development and the influence of war.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-03T18-05-00-03-00/1688396520-912.jpeg)“The war is not part of Ukrainian identity. But freedom is a value that is part of Ukrainian identity. History often demonstrates that if someone wants to maintain their freedom, then at some points it is forced to go for it. There are some nations that have a war in their essence, but it is not a pro -Ukraine and Ukrainians - we have never colonized anything or the Great Wars. For most of their history, Ukrainians wanted to live a passionate state, to lead their own way of life, to have their own values and their gravity in their own hands. The wars were because someone wanted to take it all away, ”Oleksandr Tomashchuk, a member of the Board of the Board of the Ukrainian Vnierland Foundation, emphasized in the framework of the discussion.

Проте в партіях правлячої коаліції почали накопичуватися суперечності. Різкезагострення, котре призвело то нинішньої кризи, сталося в середині червняпісля усунення з посади в.о. директора Департаменту сполучення Ризької думиЯніса Вайводса, а також суперечок, хто має вести розслідування через можливізловживання – бюро виконавчого директора Риги чи спеціальна слідча комісія.

Станом на понеділок відомо, що Статіс йде з посади, але залишається депутатомРизької думи та говорить про готовність до ведення переговорів. Водночас "Новаєдність" заявила, що готова взяти на себе відповідальність за створення новоїкоаліції, але чекає на вибачення від партії "Прогресивні" за різкізвинувачення на адресу колег.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Georgia Online](https://www.apsny.ge/2023/pol/1688404134.php).

"In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Georgia](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-gruzia)There is a meeting with a temporary attorney for Ukraine's affairs by Oleksandr Shulga, " - the message reads.

It is noted that the call of the temporary attorney to the Foreign Ministry of Georgia is related to the implementation of sanctions on Georgian Airways by the Ukrainian side.

He also saw in this decision of the Ukrainian authorities the influence of the Georgian Opposition.

"It is sad to say that we have seen another extremely unfriendly decision by Vladyus. Such facts were in our previous cases where several citizens of the community were under the so -called sanctions of the authorities of Ukraine," the official added.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-03T19-57-00-03-00/630_360_1688403221-549.jpg)From the beginning of the full -scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Finnish companies have groomed at least EUR 1.5 billion.

This is stated in the editorial investigation [Yle](https://yle.fi/a/74-20039531)The MOT, based on customs statistics received from the Trade Register, reports.

In fact, investigators say, this amount is much higher, since only part of Finnish companies that trade with [Russia] are sampled.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia). Also, the data is not comprehensive because of their information on import and export after 2022.

It is emphasized that some of these funds have come to the accounts of companies, whose owners are under sanctions and are part of the near circle of President of RFPutin.

According to the investigation, during the war the goods were delivered from Finland, for example, to large mines in Russia.

Many Finnish companies, such as Neste and Metsouttec, continued to trade with Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine. Many companies explain the renewal of business in Russia with the difficulties of selling their assets and the execution of contracts concluded before the war.

For example, Metso Outtec, which provides technologies and equipment for Girchnykhone, processing and metalworking industry, has announced a little more than a week after the Russian invasion of stopping Dorosis.

In practice, the company continued to trade in Russia at least several more times afterwards. It exported to Russia, in particular, the spare parts of the tadethali for the equipment. The clients of the company were numerous Russian enterprises owned by sub -pod -oligarchs. The largest client of the company was the Thaiset aluminum plant related to the oligarchmoleh Deripaska.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3730827-nazk-vneslo-kompaniu-unilever-do-spisku-miznarodnih-sponsoriv-vijni.html)Metso Outtec also supplied products to the UDOKAN Copper enterprise - one of the world's largest copper producers, and Mikhailovskaya Iron -Driving, owned by Metaloinvest, which is one of the largest copper producers in Russia. Their largest owner is Alisher Usmanov, who, according to the list of EU sanctions, is closely linked to Putin.However, despite the fact that the oligarchs are under sanctions, trade with companies they possess can be legal, Yle writes. According to Pius Sarivaara, who is responsible for sanctions in Finland, trade with the company is allowed if the part of the Russian who has been sanctioned is up to 50%. If the company has several sub -owners, their shares in total should increase 50%.

According to him, during the passing week, the situation on the front was significantly invariable. But this does not mean that the offensive of the Armed Forces has been suspended or does not have any successes.

"The Armed Forces of the Armed Forces are enemy rear, destroying up to 30 enemy artillery per day. With such a rate per month of the Armed Forces can reduce the possibility of an enemy in artillery per month.

"So far, the main forces we planned to apply in this operation are unburdened. We bleed the enemy rear, destroy its warehouses, infrastructure, various logistics routes, and destroy high -artillery systems in the counter -battery struggle - up to 30 units of their artillery. They use artillery systems, then with such temples, we can at least a few weeks or a month in half their opportunities in artillery. Not from the point of view of the number of shots, because they remain shells, but in relation to the number of artillery systems from which they can fire " , - the hetman explained.

That is, on the land, then, which they punched at the beginning of a full -scale invasion, "hetman emphasized.

At the same time, the analyst is convinced that the Russians have no strength and means for recent promotion.

"When we say that they are throwing certain reserves, we need to understand that in the middle of Russia, they have no second army in the rear, there are no reserves that they can attach to strengthen their defense or in some areas of the counter -offensive.97% Front. They are moving their troops along the front and in the hottest destinations. Hetman.

_ ** I wish health, dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!** _

First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.

I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: more than 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and infant winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.

During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was posthumous to him.By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!

In today's conversation with Mr. Chancellor, we focused, of course, on further cooperation, as well as on strategic issues in the protection of our Europe - Europe, which can only be peaceful when peace will be guaranteed for it with complete security. There may be no security deficit in Europe that will provoke Russian tyranny and aggression. Russia will try to bite one or another piece of Europe only when it will see the other security uncertainty. When everything is defined and obvious, Russian -sized does not dare to break security.

Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.

We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.

And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.

Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!

It is especially worth noting today the junior lieutenant Alexander Pavlov, commander of the Marine infantry platoon of the 36th Brigade of Marines. His confident trick actions, skillful management in battle give good results to the state. Thank you!

The crew of the T-80 tank under the command of the junior sergeant Andrei Marchuk-thankmed and courage!This is the 36th brigade of the Marines.

And from the 35th brigade I will note today the commander of the tank, the junior sergeant Artmamatobrazka-thank you for the true Ukrainian courage and skill in the possession of the settlement Makarivka. Thank you, Artem!

Senior soldier Eugene Poddubny, sapper of the 47th mechanized brigade. It operates on a very hot direction and performs its tasks very effectively. Thank you, Eugene!The Mariinsky Direction ... Artillery Division under the command of Lieutenant Lukjianova does not give the occupiers a single minute of rest. Your combatants are really significant!Thank you!

Thank you all who are in battle now, at combat posts and positions!Thank you everyone who helps!

And one more.

The world today saw the Kremlin - unfortunately, by the hands of the current power of Georgia - kills a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili. Human life is the highest value and cannot be allowed to destroy Michael. Ukraine has urged the power of Georgia to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and the skipartners offered various rescue options of Michael. Today, I am the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to summon Ambassador of Georgia to Ukraine, expressed in a protest and propose to leave Ukraine for the next 48 hours for consultation with my capital. Once again I urge the Georgian power to convey to Ukraine a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili for necessary treatment and care. And I urge our partners to turn, not to ignore the cavity and save this person. No authorities in Europe have the right to execute people, life is a basic European value.

_**Glory to Ukraine!** _

The prosecutor noted that such a measure is necessary because the sub -person has considerable lawyer's experience, including pre -trial investigations, is a People's Deputy, has direct and indirect ties to the right protection authorities, as well as because of the severity of the crime, namely, seizure of US $ 50,000.(1.8 million hryvnias)German citizen.

According to the prosecutor Jacob Slyzarenko, Alekseev allegedly promised the foreigner Kevinustestklov to obtain a Ukrainian passport, to assist in the avoidance of extradition. He "guaranteed" to use his own connections.The defendant noted that the German repeatedly called after he was called law enforcement officers in Ukraine, and transferred funds for lawyers who worked on his case for almost two years.

“Kevin was simply used to bring me money at the time, as if a bribe was home. Another interesting fact is that his statement is written in a legally correct Russian language, which he does not speak… I ask the judge to be fair to reap that this case is fake. I ask not to choose a precautionary measure to get me to the bail of colleagues, ”Alekseev said during the hearing.

Commenting on the situation in the south, Anna Malyar noted that the Armed Forces had released about 28 square kilometers.

- Our troops are faced with continuous replacement, including remote. We have the promotion of Ukrainian troops in some areas. However, not only released territories should be measured.

The court then heard the prosecutor who persuaded the judge to choose Aleksevzevzhzhzhzhias. The prosecutor noted that such a measure is necessary because the sub -person has considerable lawyer's experience, including pre -trial investigations, is a People's Deputy, has direct and indirect ties to the right protection authorities, as well as because of the severity of the crime, namely, seizure of US $ 50,000.(1.8 million hryvnias)German citizen.

According to the prosecutor Jacob Slyzarenko, Alekseev allegedly promised the foreigner Kevinustestklov to obtain a Ukrainian passport, to assist in the avoidance of extradition. He "guaranteed" to use his own connections.The defendant noted that the German repeatedly called after he was called law enforcement officers in Ukraine, and transferred funds for lawyers who worked on his case for almost two years.

“Kevin was simply used to bring me money at the time, as if a bribe was home. Another interesting fact is that his statement is written in a legally correct Russian language, which he does not speak… I ask the judge to be fair to reap that this case is fake. I ask not to choose a precautionary measure to get me to the bail of colleagues, ”Alekseev said during the hearing.

After the decision of the court on the election of a preventive measure, Alekseev was further broken down that the case was fabricated, and the affected citizen of Germany, who is in the search of Interpol, through the sale of drugs in large volumes, is the "nasty" of the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.

The People's Deputy gave the phone and personal belongings to the advocacy, asked for the escorts, so that they had handcuffed on him, because it "humiliates a lawyer with many years of conscious."

Alekseev will spend this night in the Lviv pre -trial detention center, because even if he gathered the sum of money - more than 2 million UAH, after 18:00 no bank will accept payment.

The enemy does not give up the terrorist method of fighting-the Ukrainian cities of rockets, including C-300 and UAVs, are athabiting. The spokesman of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was announced during today's briefing conducted in Ukrinform, on the topic: "Protection of the Ukrainian sky: the current situation is likely intentions of the enemy."

He noted that for the most part, strokes were struck at night to complicate the work of a re -empty defense due to the lack of visual attachment.

-Today, the enemy attacked Kamikadze drones both at night and day. Unfortunately, we see that it was not without hits. It is difficult to deal with such goals, because it is the enemy tolerates the ammunition from different directions, each drone is programmed to be exposed to a particular route, which disperses the attention of our experts. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to cover the whole territory of Ukraine with air defense, so it is almost impossible to overlap the most important state objects and directions.

Yuri Ignat noted that they provide air protection not for the state, but also mobile fire groups, fighter aviation.

-Of course, if we had already used the F-16 instead of the MiG-29, the efficiency was higher. Every day of delay is the life of our patriots, defenders of the pelvicate, we want to start the process of preparing pilots as soon as possible.

Новостворений центр стане ключовим для розслідуваннязлочину агресії рф проти України та сприятиме створенню справ для майбутніхсудових процесів. Він забезпечить структуру для підтримки та посиленняпоточних і майбутніх розслідувань злочину агресії та сприятиме обміну тааналізу доказів, зібраних з початку російської агресії.

Про це йдеться у[повідомленні](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3606)EU press service.

The Center, created with the support of the European Commission, consists of the selected national prosecutors who are already involved in the joint investigative group, with which the Central Committee is related in its activities. Participants will be able to work daily, share evidence quickly and reconcile a common strategy. Eurostan will provide operational, legal, financial and logistical support, in particular for the preservation, storage and analysis of evidence. This work has an important thing to prepare for future lawsuits, whether in national or international courts, including a possible tribunal for aggression crimes by an international criminal court(MKS)for crimes that fall under the youth.

“Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to bring unspeakable horrors every day. The deep -life news of deliberate attacks on civilians, including children, became a daily daily reminder of the bloodshed, which Putin returned to the continent. Evidence of innumerable international crimes committed by Russia is accumulated. The new International Center will play a key role in the prosecution of the perpetrators, in particular for crime. We will not leave the stone on the stone until we attract Putin and his strings to justice, ”[noted](https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1675795810900930561)The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Lien.

This was reported by the press service [IAEA.](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-169-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine-0)"The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was again connected to a single accessible disposable power line after four months after its loss, and the energy supply is extremely fragile during the ongoing military conflict on the site," the General Director General of Atomic Energy said(IDA)Raphael Marianne Grossi.

According to him, the reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important, since the course of the last few months has relied on a single trunk line 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor of the more important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, it had four lines of 750 square meters.

Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup Tagotov to NPPs if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.

During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.

"Although the reconstruction of the power line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear safety and security of the ground," said IAEA head.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/1-2-1-scaled.jpg)The North Atlantic Alliance has undergone a certain evolution in the understanding of what is a defense, restraint, and how to respond to security challenges. The beginning of the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 from the occupation of Crimea and the beginning of hostilities, Nadonbass led to conceptual changes in NATO.

More about NATO changing its approaches to security, said a tribal interview for the ArmyInform CEO of Rasmussen Globalfabris, which previously formed the Alliance Development Strategy. The first part of the NATO summit in Wales 2014 and whether 2 %of GDP costs are enough.

** _-_ ** ** What do you think about NATO transformations during Russian large -scale coordination of Russia to Ukraine? How did the war change alliance? **

_-_ I think there were two speakers. First, when NATO for the first time in the latest history began to revise their concept of nuclear restraint. This was really a reversible moment. When I joined NATO in 2010, there was an analysis of defense and nuclear restraint, but very few people were ready to talk about nuclear restraint as such.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/2-2-1.jpg)NATO leaders at Chicago Summit 2012

In 2014, there was a moment when NATO had to rethink these terms to re -reinstall them. So, I think, in the conceptual, intellectual development, it was the discovery of the concept of nuclear restraint. NATO had to defile its position in the European territory against what it has argued as a greater threat to Russia.

And the second dynamics is that, apparently, a much minority was carried out, which were needed to restrain Putin. As we are unfortunately the field in 2022, eight years he made it again _(_ _ stopped on Ukraine. —The ed.)_.

And that means that in some way NATO's restraint and defense measures have been partially seized. Yes, the Alliance managed to protect its territory, but the plans of holding were failed, including sanctions that did not change the behavior of theuputin. Therefore, I think it was an important lesson in 2014._-_ If you look at [the strategic concept of 2010](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm), it was a truly attempt to find a balance between three main tasks. Namely collective defense, foreign missions and new security threats. But very quickly, since 2014, the concept of 2010 was crossed out by the first Russian aggression against Ukraine.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/3-1-1.jpg)And I started editing a strategic concept. You know when a Word is viewed to see what can be changed, which is completely complete. And how NATO characterized relations with Russia, obviously, it was more strategic partnership.

I think that the balance between the above three main tasks was also impossible.

The main task was the collective defense of the Alliance. And then we began to combine other activities around the defense, including new threats.

** _-_ ** ** Why NATO Wales Summit in 2014 became historical? **

_-_ I think it was the first point when NATO returned to Europe both as a waoperative and philosophical sense. It was the first summit to which it was considering its main mission in Europe. The value of the latter was not the main among the priorities of the Alliance.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/4-3-scaled.jpg)And I remember the meeting in the North Atlantic Council _(NATO's main political organ. - Ed.)_, on which we discussed how to build a territorial defense and what weapons need to have. But then new gaps emerged strategic planning, such as mobility.

NATO had a new brilliant solution after Wales _ --__ a plan of readiness. The Equati argued that more than 40,000 NATO forces would be almost constantly being deployed on the eastern flank. But for a short time, they had to be deposited with additional alliance forces.

We have realized that there were no legal arrangements to quickly overwhelm NATO forces.

Part, if you want, rethink an alliance called "Readiness Action Plan", agreed at the Summit in Newport(Wales)In the United Kingdom, which became a truly molding summit. Because at that time, NATO allies discussed the teaching of foreign forces about Afghanistan. Instead, the Alliance did not speak prokelive defense and nuclear restraint in the European territory.

The summit in Wales was the first of a series of summits, where the topics of discussion are collective defense, nuclear restraint and Russia. And the trend persists._-_ Yes, it was a heavy battle. I prepared the initial Atlantic Declaration. The intervals were difficult, especially with Canada and Germany. The then Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, was a fiscal hawk, which was compounded for money for 2 % of GDP for defense. And then many other countries hid the borrowing of Canada and Germany, because it was convenient.

As a result, we received a text with a typical diplomatic language where there were many of the magnitude.

However, we can call it success. Why? Because for the first time, such a requirement was presented for approval to the heads of state.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/5-3-scaled.jpg)The main results of the NATO summit in Wales/ Army Infographic

And that was my initial idea when Anders Fog Rasmussen _(NATO Secretary General U2009-2014. - Ed.)_ announced her. In fact, 2 % of the cost of defending in the past, and even 3 % during the Cold War.

** _-_ ** ** What is the result of this obligation now? **

_-_ first, there are two people who have forced to increase NATO's costs for defense _ --_ Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. In a crazy way but trigger became(aggressive)Putin's actions against Ukraine. Therefore, many European countries have acknowledged that they need to increase defense and ability.

And then Donald Trump _(In 2016. - Ed.)_ was elected President of the United States. He began to distort the idea that the US obligation to NATO _-_ is the investment in defense. And it caused another shock in the Alliance.

NATO countries are still not achieving the goal, so now we can only talk about the seven units that have 2 %. I think there are ten countries that are close to this purpose or reach it by 2024.

When you look at the overall situation, you can give the argument a projection already 3 %. And I know that on the eve of the Vilnius Summit in NATO there were disclosures to have a target of 2.5 % as new 2 %.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/6-1-1.jpg)This is a discussion to have 2 % not as a maximum but a minimum. NATO has the opportunity to go beyond the boundaries of 2 %. But the Alliance countries do not yet have the necessary expenses. And this is evidence that Europeans have not yet set defense on the first plane of their priorities, knowing the world we live in.

First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.

I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: over 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and a hundred winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.

During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was assigned to him posthumously.

Unfortunately, our state does not yet have enough quality air defense systems to protect our entire territory and knock down all hostile goals. The enemy is used as it is today - by inflicting another terrorist strike on the town of Iranian drone, in particular on residential buildings, as well as on the building of the Security Service of Ukraine. As a result of these blows, there are wounded, there are dead ... My condolences!We will make everything possible and impossible to make our air defense the strongest. Today, General Oleshchuk, Commander of the Air Force, reported on our actions. In order for the Ukrainian airboard to be able to close the entire territory from the Russian terror, and in the future - to become the basis for the European air shield. It is absolutely necessary and absolutely possible.

By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.

We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.

And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.

Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!

It is especially worth noting today the junior lieutenant Alexander Pavlov, commander of the Marine infantry platoon of the 36th Brigade of Marines. His confident trick actions, skillful management in battle give good results to the state. Thank you!

The T-80 tank crew under the command of the junior sergeant Andrei Marchuk-Thankme Accuracy and Courage!This is the 36th brigade of the Marines.

And from the 35th brigade, I will celebrate the tank commander, junior sergeant Artmatobrazka today-thank you for the true Ukrainian courage and skill in the possession of the settlement of Makarivka. Thank you, Artem!

Senior soldier Eugene Poddubny, sapper of the 47th mechanized brigade. It operates on a very hot direction and performs its tasks very effectively. Thank you, Eugene!

Captain Ivan Ogurtsov. Acting in the Avdeevsky direction, our firewartilers under its command very effectively destroy the enclosures and warehouses. Thank you, warrior!

The Mariinsky Direction ... Artillery Division under the command of Lieutenant Lukjianova does not give the occupiers a single minute of rest. Your combatants are really significant!Thank you!

Thank you all who are in battle now, at combat posts and positions!Thank you everyone who helps!

And one more.**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/1-3-1.jpg)Today, the Hague has announced the creation of an International Center for Investigation for Crime Agression against Ukraine. In general, the issue of bringing the reference of Russian military criminals is among the main priorities of Ukraine and foreign partners. Therefore, it is important to understand the legal mechanisms of the process.

The Armyinform correspondent, while in Brussels as part of the EU response in Ukraine, recorded an exclusive interview with the European Commissariatration Didie Raineneds about the Roman Statute and Ukraine and how Russian military criminals can be built.

** - Why is the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine is crucial for investigating Russian military crimes? ** **

- First of all, it is very important for all democratic countries to participate in international institutions involved in the fight against international crime. International criminal court was created to organize investigations, prosecution and condemnation of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide crimes or aggression.

And this is very important for all participants in the process. This is the first reason for such a reclamation country as Ukraine, as a candidate country for entrance to the EU, very importantly participate.

I repeat all the time that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has come time to ratify the Roman Statute _(Ukraine has signed in 2000, but not yet ratified. - Ed.)_.

The second reason why it is important to do because if you ask to apply_(against Russia. - Ed.)_ International rules, you also need to eat with them in Ukraine. I know that military crimes in Ukraine have been committed by the Russians.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/2-3.jpg)The world map showing the status of the Roman Statute

I cited an example when they send the UN peacekeeping mission to another country and is shaking war. And then it is worth making sure that persons who committed war crimes, for example, will be punished against women and children.

Because if the country is involved in the international process, international jurisdiction, it is easier to come to court with more and more countries that we need to support Ukraine. In this way, a tribunal will be created on the crime of aggression.

Therefore, the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine will, of course, help organize investigation, persecution and condemnation of Russians responsible for these crimes.- Starting from February 24, 2022, Euras _(The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Salvation. - Ed.)_ tried to create a duplicate mechanism based on existing tools. Eurosta plays the role of intermediary between prosecutors of different countries. So two things were done.

You know that because of Russian aggression in Ukraine it was difficult to obtain digital division. So, we changed the position in euro. Now Euras has created the Basudans to collect all evidence and exchange them between prosecutors of different EU Member States, the International Criminal Court in Ukraine-everywhere. This is the first step.

[As the International Criminal Court arrests Putin](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/03/20/yak-mizhnarodnyj-kryminalnyj-sud-zaareshtuye-putina/)The next is the organization of skillful coordination of actions. So, we have a joint investigation, that is, a specific team with prosecutors of the EU Member States, Ukraine, the International Criminal Court. There is a good cooperation with our American colleagues for data exchange, investigation and judicial reversal of war crimes. A joint investigative group - the third part - will now be the International Center for Pursuing Crime Aggression against Ukraine.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/3-2.jpg)It is not only about war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, but also a crime of aggression. There is an opportunity to gather evidence and prepare the prosecution research group. Such a role is given to European.

In addition, Eurasa gives the ability to work together. We have meetings of prosecutors between participants from different countries of the world and, of course, from Europe.

Eurost plays a central role in the development of the process, as there is a collection of collection and organized coordination between prosecutors.

** - ** ** What is your position on the chances of bringing Russia to justice comprehensive violations of international law? **

- I am convinced that we have a lot of evidence that Russia has made multi -ordinations of international law to give the first and possibly two examples. So, the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is obvious. And the violation of the state sovereignty of Ukraine is obvious.

That is why we try to work on a crime of aggression separately. But now the ICS will talk hard about specific violations of certain conventions. We try to give all the support to get more evidence of a violation.

My work is to provide all opportunities and tools to the prosecutors with judges to perform their work, investigate, pursue and judge military warriors.** - ** ** What is your position on investigating the crime of Russia's genocide anti -Ukraine? **

- We have a jurisdiction on all international crimes, including crime. There is an International Criminal Court.

It is clear that they do everything possible in the ISS for investigation.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/4-4.jpg)Of course, when you talk about genocide, it is more difficult to investigate in comparison with military crimes or crimes against humanity. But in the hands of the ISS this is possible, because in the Roman statute there is the ability to work on various crimes.

Yes, it is a crime of aggression under the Roman statute. But this situation cannot be put into effect, I explained because of the specific situation of Russia _(The Russian Federation signed, but was unattractive, and in 2016 Moscow withdrew the signature of the document. –Aut.)._

Але можливе і розслідування справи про геноцид. Я не випадково сказав, що мипочали дискусію на початку березня минулого року з Євроюстом і «Мережеюгеноциду» _(_ _Eurovist network for investigation and judicial persecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. - Ed.)_. We want all available tools.

I just want to be sure that all the prosecutors responsible for the formation of the position could go to the court where they already have to make a decision.

You know that in the past it was the most sufficient decision in the event of investigation of the crime of genocide in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. In Ukraine, Eco -Comand of the ISS.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/5-4.jpg)Even during the war, we intend to create a reliable decision to be sure that during life, military criminals should know that there is a rice to be a court or a tribunal.

** - ** ** What are your impressions of cooperation with Ukrainian colleagues? **

- From the beginning of the Russian large -scale invasion, I first and foremost contact the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Also with Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and then Andrew Kostin. We tried to be very specific, and we were convinced that it was very effective. For us, it was and remains the real part of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, European and all the instruments that Ya - Litted earlier. But it was also a clear message for us that we are working for a common purpose - punishment of criminals.

He notes that the number one is currently increasing the number of recent weapons.

- The Ukrainian air defense has strengthened significantly, first of all, it is the achievement of our people, which constantly improve skills, maneuvering, trying to predict where the next blow is building. Of course, without Western weapons-NASAMS, Iris-T, Patriot-we would not be able to show such incredible results. With the advent of Patriot, we have also been able to destroy ballistic goals. In modern systems, the human factor is minimized, they are automatic capacity. The advantages include the high speed of rockets, a long range, a pumped outlet system.

Denis Rozzhny shares that at dawn on February 24, 22, firmly approved to destroy everything they saw in the air. However, now this decision is supported by a serious argument in the form of powerful air defense complexes.

-If at the beginning of the war we knocked a third of the calibers and the X-101 missiles, then it was considered a great success at that time. Today we destroy from 80 percent of such goals, and in some cases we demonstrate a 100 % result. This is the merit of not only anti -aircraft fires, but also mobile fire groups, fighter aviation and other structures and troops. We all work together!

And although now the experts are not for celebrations, and to relax through constant nighttime attacks, the anti -aircraft attacks rarely succeed, Denis Pasti promised: “Let's win!And then we will rest!And we celebrate!”.
