<p>About it <a href="https://m.facebook.com/Ministry.for.restoration?eav=AfYQSzuFdOBCeayfHSu7eUbQLG_UzqeHJArpE2MYW65UCEXvCAlar2VZRerx2UP3YTw&amp;paipv=0">reports</a>Ministry of Community Development, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.</p>
<p>29 ships that have to export 1.4 million tons of food mainly for the 5 countries of Asia and Africa, including China, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, blocked by Russia in Turkey's territorial waters.</p>
<p>In June, only 2 million tons were exported from Ukrainian ports. Another 1 million tons of food will either load or have already been partially loaded on 13 ships - the last registered in the initiative. If you do not restore the registration, the grain agreement will be completely stopped.</p>
<p>In 11 months, 45 countries received 32.5 million tons of food. An additional 25 million tons of tonnes did not receive the world due to sabotage. But even with these indicators, according to the UN, it was possible to reduce the world prices for food by 22%. This is a direct evidence that the grain agreement is needed by the world.</p>
<p>We support a statement of the Joint Coordination Center that all parties should be adequately accessed by vessels for food export, because it is a food danger to the entire world market. Only joint guns is able to stop Russia's food.</p>
<p>We urge partners under the agreement and all countries of the civilized world to defend the right to food. Ukraine, for its part, will also defend the right of a prominent trade navigation, which is recorded in international conventions.</p>

<p>_ <strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.</p>
<p>I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: more than 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and infant winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.</p>
<p>During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was posthumous to him.By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!</p>
<p>In today's conversation with Mr. Chancellor, we focused, of course, on further cooperation, as well as on strategic issues in the protection of our Europe - Europe, which can only be peaceful when peace will be guaranteed for it with complete security. There may be no security deficit in Europe that will provoke Russian tyranny and aggression. Russia will try to bite one or another piece of Europe only when it will see the other security uncertainty. When everything is defined and obvious, Russian -sized does not dare to break security.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.</p>
<p>We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.</p>
<p>And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.</p>
<p>Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!</p>

<p>The world today saw the Kremlin - unfortunately, by the hands of the current power of Georgia - kills a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili. Human life is the highest value and cannot be allowed to destroy Michael. Ukraine has urged the power of Georgia to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and the skipartners offered various rescue options of Michael. Today, I am the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to summon Ambassador of Georgia to Ukraine, expressed in a protest and propose to leave Ukraine for the next 48 hours for consultation with my capital. Once again I urge the Georgian power to convey to Ukraine a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili for necessary treatment and care. And I urge our partners to turn, not to ignore the cavity and save this person. No authorities in Europe have the right to execute people, life is a basic European value.</p>
<p>_<strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong> _</p>

<p>About it at the Media Center Ukraine - Ukrinform was informed by a spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces Yuri Ignat.</p>
<p>“According to statistics, most enemy rocket <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-obstril">blows</a>It is done at night because it complicates the work of air defense. For us to have quite a lot of problems, they are launched from different directions, different routes, which complicates the work of the air defense and disperses the attention of our anti -aircraft and other specialists who are killed, ”he added.</p>
<p>Other components of defense forces work: large -caliber machine guns, anti -aircraft guns, and MAZRK. The role of air defense is played by fighters. However, Ignati noted that if it were F-16 and not MiG-29, the efficiency would have increased many times.</p>
<p>He also noted that there was a short -lived absence of shelling of the capital, probably, can be related to both the plans of the enemy and the fact that the reserves of rockets and drones of the recipients are not endless.</p>
<p>“There are days when more, there are days when less. If we have not died for three days, it does not mean that we need to relax, and they have changed, ”he stressed.</p>

<p>"On the side <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-minoboroni">Ministry of Defense</a>not only common sense, but also civil and economic codes, a number of system -forming laws on entrepreneurship and so on.

<p>It is generally recognized that the armed forces of Sweden are compatible with other NATO countries. Sweden has a permanent representation in NATO and is considered a close partner of the Alliance, that is, the country's accession to the organization should be relatively simple.</p>
<p>But Turkey - the second largest armed forces, the Alliance's military force - blocks Sweden's entry for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Among them is the statement that Sweden allows members of Kurdish terrorist groups to operate in the country, especially the militant workers' Party of Kardistan(RPK).</p>

<p>About it with reference to the famous issues of interlocutors in the Indian regime reports <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/india-refiners-start-yuan-payments-russian-oil-imports-sources-2023-07-03/">Reuters</a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>After the Sanctions imposed by the Western states against Russia for its invasion of Moscow in Ukraine, it was forced to redirect exports of its energy to the east, and India became the largest buyer of maritime Russian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nafta">oil</a>. However, the question of calculations that became problematic in the conditions of rigid anti -Russian restrictions.</p>
<p>The US dollar for a long time has been the main currency in the world oil market, including for the procurement of India, but now for the operations of Island suppliers, Yuan is increasingly important, the role of which has increased rapidly after the deprivation of Moscow's access to the dollar.</p>

<p>The interlocutors of the publication said that in June, the largest buyer of Russian Syroinaft in the country of Indian Oil became the first state oil refinery to pay for some parties of Russian oil in Yuan.</p>
<p>At least two of the three large private refineries of India are also paid for part of Russian imports in Yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, none of India's private refineries - Reliance Industries, supported by Russia by Nayara Energy and HPCl Mittal Energy, were not answered to the Reuters about comments. Indian Oil also ignored the comment request.</p>
<p>The increase in payments in Yuan has pushed Beijing's efforts to internationalize the currency, since Chinese banks lobby for its use almost exclusively for Russian oil trade.The import of Russian crude oil in India has grown to record indicators in May, with Russian raw materials 40% of the total import of oil in India comparable to 16.5% earlier. Due to the cheaper oil from the Russian Federation, India decreases from Iraq and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>While Western sanctions against Moscow do not recognize, and the purchase of non -non -non -disruption may not be violated, Indian banks are cautious about such import payments.</p>
<p>In May, the State Bank of India, the main lender of the country and the key banker for the state oil refineries, rejected the request of Indian Oil on the payment of the cargo for the cargo delivered by "Rosneftia".</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-07-03T18-05-00-03-00/1688396520-912.jpeg" />“The war is not part of Ukrainian identity. But freedom is a value that is part of Ukrainian identity. History often demonstrates that if someone wants to maintain their freedom, then at some points it is forced to go for it. There are some nations that have a war in their essence, but it is not a pro -Ukraine and Ukrainians - we have never colonized anything or the Great Wars. For most of their history, Ukrainians wanted to live a passionate state, to lead their own way of life, to have their own values and their gravity in their own hands. The wars were because someone wanted to take it all away, ”Oleksandr Tomashchuk, a member of the Board of the Board of the Ukrainian Vnierland Foundation, emphasized in the framework of the discussion.</p>

<p>According to the philosopher of the Foundation for Public Art Foundation, France HerredsUkraine must be in the EU.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-07-03T18-05-00-03-00/1688396604-642.jpg" />“The largest demonstration for the EU was a demonstration in Kyiv in the first slowly starting Euromaidan. It was the greatest demonstration for joining the EU. So how does Ukraine be in the EU? Of course. Will Ukraine in the EU? So. I think very quickly victory. Because the moral capital you receive from Europe is huge. It will be very difficult for you to refuse. This does not mean that all nations will be "behind" and will meet you with arms. No. But there will be the vast majority who want to want Ukraine in the EU, ”Hereds emphasized.</p>

<p>This is stated in the editorial investigation <a href="https://yle.fi/a/74-20039531">Yle</a>The MOT, based on customs statistics received from the Trade Register, reports.</p>
<p>In fact, investigators say, this amount is much higher, since only part of Finnish companies that trade with [Russia] are sampled.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia). Also, the data is not comprehensive because of their information on import and export after 2022.</p>
<p>It is emphasized that some of these funds have come to the accounts of companies, whose owners are under sanctions and are part of the near circle of President of RFPutin.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, during the war the goods were delivered from Finland, for example, to large mines in Russia.</p>
<p>Many Finnish companies, such as Neste and Metsouttec, continued to trade with Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine. Many companies explain the renewal of business in Russia with the difficulties of selling their assets and the execution of contracts concluded before the war.</p>
<p>For example, Metso Outtec, which provides technologies and equipment for Girchnykhone, processing and metalworking industry, has announced a little more than a week after the Russian invasion of stopping Dorosis.</p>
<p>In practice, the company continued to trade in Russia at least several more times afterwards. It exported to Russia, in particular, the spare parts of the tadethali for the equipment. The clients of the company were numerous Russian enterprises owned by sub -pod -oligarchs. The largest client of the company was the Thaiset aluminum plant related to the oligarchmoleh Deripaska.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3730827-nazk-vneslo-kompaniu-unilever-do-spisku-miznarodnih-sponsoriv-vijni.html)Metso Outtec also supplied products to the UDOKAN Copper enterprise - one of the world's largest copper producers, and Mikhailovskaya Iron -Driving, owned by Metaloinvest, which is one of the largest copper producers in Russia. Their largest owner is Alisher Usmanov, who, according to the list of EU sanctions, is closely linked to Putin.However, despite the fact that the oligarchs are under sanctions, trade with companies they possess can be legal, Yle writes. According to Pius Sarivaara, who is responsible for sanctions in Finland, trade with the company is allowed if the part of the Russian who has been sanctioned is up to 50%. If the company has several sub -owners, their shares in total should increase 50%.</p>

<p><em>Wherelo: op</em></p>
<p>_ <strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong> _</p>
<p>First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.</p>
<p>I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: more than 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and infant winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.</p>
<p>During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was posthumous to him.By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!</p>
<p>In today's conversation with Mr. Chancellor, we focused, of course, on further cooperation, as well as on strategic issues in the protection of our Europe - Europe, which can only be peaceful when peace will be guaranteed for it with complete security. There may be no security deficit in Europe that will provoke Russian tyranny and aggression. Russia will try to bite one or another piece of Europe only when it will see the other security uncertainty. When everything is defined and obvious, Russian -sized does not dare to break security.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.</p>
<p>We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.</p>
<p>And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.</p>
<p>Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!</p>
<p>It is especially worth noting today the junior lieutenant Alexander Pavlov, commander of the Marine infantry platoon of the 36th Brigade of Marines. His confident trick actions, skillful management in battle give good results to the state. Thank you!</p>
<p>The crew of the T-80 tank under the command of the junior sergeant Andrei Marchuk-thankmed and courage!This is the 36th brigade of the Marines.</p>
<p>And from the 35th brigade I will note today the commander of the tank, the junior sergeant Artmamatobrazka-thank you for the true Ukrainian courage and skill in the possession of the settlement Makarivka. Thank you, Artem!</p>
<p>Senior soldier Eugene Poddubny, sapper of the 47th mechanized brigade. It operates on a very hot direction and performs its tasks very effectively. Thank you, Eugene!The Mariinsky Direction ... Artillery Division under the command of Lieutenant Lukjianova does not give the occupiers a single minute of rest. Your combatants are really significant!Thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you all who are in battle now, at combat posts and positions!Thank you everyone who helps!</p>
<p>And one more.</p>
<p>The world today saw the Kremlin - unfortunately, by the hands of the current power of Georgia - kills a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili. Human life is the highest value and cannot be allowed to destroy Michael. Ukraine has urged the power of Georgia to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and the skipartners offered various rescue options of Michael. Today, I am the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to summon Ambassador of Georgia to Ukraine, expressed in a protest and propose to leave Ukraine for the next 48 hours for consultation with my capital. Once again I urge the Georgian power to convey to Ukraine a citizen of Ukraine Mikhail Saakashvili for necessary treatment and care. And I urge our partners to turn, not to ignore the cavity and save this person. No authorities in Europe have the right to execute people, life is a basic European value.</p>
<p>_<strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong> _</p>

<p>The lawyer Alekseevaevgeny Sweet informed about it in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>"Of course, we will appeal and ask that the case is heard to Kiev, because now it is in violation of the legislation, since according to the resolution of the Deputy Prosecutor General Voitenko, the pre -trial investigation has been conducted by the GSU of the DBR in Kiev, and the court should have taken place there," - said.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-sud">judicial</a>The meeting of a lawyer made his remarks for several hours.</p>
<p>“Everyone understands that these interrogations of the victim and a statement from a German citizen who does not possess Russian, someone did, and even without any initial data. We understand that it is a falsification. Those documents provided by the prosecutor's prosecutor for detention are not given to Alekseev ” - said Sweet.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the court hearing, the defense counsel filed a petition for the consideration of the case, as the defense sent to the Court of Appeal of Lviv an application to the Supreme Court to transfer the case to the court.</p>

<p>The court then heard the prosecutor who persuaded the judge to choose Aleksevzevzhzhzhzhias. The prosecutor noted that such a measure is necessary because the sub -person has considerable lawyer's experience, including pre -trial investigations, is a People's Deputy, has direct and indirect ties to the right protection authorities, as well as because of the severity of the crime, namely, seizure of US $ 50,000.(1.8 million hryvnias)German citizen.</p>
<p>According to the prosecutor Jacob Slyzarenko, Alekseev allegedly promised the foreigner Kevinustestklov to obtain a Ukrainian passport, to assist in the avoidance of extradition. He "guaranteed" to use his own connections.The defendant noted that the German repeatedly called after he was called law enforcement officers in Ukraine, and transferred funds for lawyers who worked on his case for almost two years.</p>
<p>“Kevin was simply used to bring me money at the time, as if a bribe was home. Another interesting fact is that his statement is written in a legally correct Russian language, which he does not speak… I ask the judge to be fair to reap that this case is fake. I ask not to choose a precautionary measure to get me to the bail of colleagues, ”Alekseev said during the hearing.</p>

<p>After the decision of the court on the election of a preventive measure, Alekseev was further broken down that the case was fabricated, and the affected citizen of Germany, who is in the search of Interpol, through the sale of drugs in large volumes, is the "nasty" of the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The People's Deputy gave the phone and personal belongings to the advocacy, asked for the escorts, so that they had handcuffed on him, because it "humiliates a lawyer with many years of conscious."</p>
<p>Alekseev will spend this night in the Lviv pre -trial detention center, because even if he gathered the sum of money - more than 2 million UAH, after 18:00 no bank will accept payment.</p>

<p>The enemy does not give up the terrorist method of fighting-the Ukrainian cities of rockets, including C-300 and UAVs, are athabiting. The spokesman of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was announced during today's briefing conducted in Ukrinform, on the topic: "Protection of the Ukrainian sky: the current situation is likely intentions of the enemy."</p>
<p>He noted that for the most part, strokes were struck at night to complicate the work of a re -empty defense due to the lack of visual attachment.</p>
<p>-Today, the enemy attacked Kamikadze drones both at night and day. Unfortunately, we see that it was not without hits. It is difficult to deal with such goals, because it is the enemy tolerates the ammunition from different directions, each drone is programmed to be exposed to a particular route, which disperses the attention of our experts. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to cover the whole territory of Ukraine with air defense, so it is almost impossible to overlap the most important state objects and directions.</p>
<p>Yuri Ignat noted that they provide air protection not for the state, but also mobile fire groups, fighter aviation.</p>
<p>-Of course, if we had already used the F-16 instead of the MiG-29, the efficiency was higher. Every day of delay is the life of our patriots, defenders of the pelvicate, we want to start the process of preparing pilots as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This was reported by the press service <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-169-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine-0">IAEA.</a>"The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant was again connected to a single accessible disposable power line after four months after its loss, and the energy supply is extremely fragile during the ongoing military conflict on the site," the General Director General of Atomic Energy said(IDA)Raphael Marianne Grossi.</p>
<p>According to him, the reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important, since the course of the last few months has relied on a single trunk line 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor of the more important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, it had four lines of 750 square meters.</p>
<p>Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup Tagotov to NPPs if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.</p>
<p>During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.</p>
<p>"Although the reconstruction of the power line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear safety and security of the ground," said IAEA head.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/1-2-1-scaled.jpg" />The North Atlantic Alliance has undergone a certain evolution in the understanding of what is a defense, restraint, and how to respond to security challenges. The beginning of the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 from the occupation of Crimea and the beginning of hostilities, Nadonbass led to conceptual changes in NATO.</p>
<p>More about NATO changing its approaches to security, said a tribal interview for the ArmyInform CEO of Rasmussen Globalfabris, which previously formed the Alliance Development Strategy. The first part of the NATO summit in Wales 2014 and whether 2 %of GDP costs are enough.</p>
<p>*!Saint-Kanen-Ivelin, Versel University of Versel University and Metropolitenlondon University. In 2007-2010 he was the founding director Carnegie Europe. In 2010-2016-the head of the NATO Secretary General Planning Office. Since 2016 - CEO of Rasmussen Global.__</p>
<p><strong> <em>-</em> </strong> <strong> What do you think about NATO transformations during Russian large -scale coordination of Russia to Ukraine? How did the war change alliance? </strong></p>
<p><em>-</em> I think there were two speakers. First, when NATO for the first time in the latest history began to revise their concept of nuclear restraint. This was really a reversible moment. When I joined NATO in 2010, there was an analysis of defense and nuclear restraint, but very few people were ready to talk about nuclear restraint as such.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/2-2-1.jpg" />NATO leaders at Chicago Summit 2012</p>
<p>In 2014, there was a moment when NATO had to rethink these terms to re -reinstall them. So, I think, in the conceptual, intellectual development, it was the discovery of the concept of nuclear restraint. NATO had to defile its position in the European territory against what it has argued as a greater threat to Russia.</p>
<p>And the second dynamics is that, apparently, a much minority was carried out, which were needed to restrain Putin. As we are unfortunately the field in 2022, eight years he made it again <em>(</em> _ stopped on Ukraine. —The ed.)_.</p>
<p>And that means that in some way NATO's restraint and defense measures have been partially seized. Yes, the Alliance managed to protect its territory, but the plans of holding were failed, including sanctions that did not change the behavior of theuputin. Therefore, I think it was an important lesson in 2014.<em>-</em> If you look at <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm">the strategic concept of 2010</a>, it was a truly attempt to find a balance between three main tasks. Namely collective defense, foreign missions and new security threats. But very quickly, since 2014, the concept of 2010 was crossed out by the first Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/3-1-1.jpg" />And I started editing a strategic concept. You know when a Word is viewed to see what can be changed, which is completely complete. And how NATO characterized relations with Russia, obviously, it was more strategic partnership.</p>
<p>I think that the balance between the above three main tasks was also impossible.</p>
<p>The main task was the collective defense of the Alliance. And then we began to combine other activities around the defense, including new threats.</p>
<p><strong> <em>-</em> </strong> <strong> Why NATO Wales Summit in 2014 became historical? </strong></p>
<p><em>-</em> I think it was the first point when NATO returned to Europe both as a waoperative and philosophical sense. It was the first summit to which it was considering its main mission in Europe. The value of the latter was not the main among the priorities of the Alliance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/4-3-scaled.jpg" />And I remember the meeting in the North Atlantic Council <em>(NATO's main political organ. - Ed.)</em>, on which we discussed how to build a territorial defense and what weapons need to have. But then new gaps emerged strategic planning, such as mobility.</p>
<p>NATO had a new brilliant solution after Wales _ --__ a plan of readiness. The Equati argued that more than 40,000 NATO forces would be almost constantly being deployed on the eastern flank. But for a short time, they had to be deposited with additional alliance forces.</p>
<p>We have realized that there were no legal arrangements to quickly overwhelm NATO forces.</p>
<p>Part, if you want, rethink an alliance called "Readiness Action Plan", agreed at the Summit in Newport(Wales)In the United Kingdom, which became a truly molding summit. Because at that time, NATO allies discussed the teaching of foreign forces about Afghanistan. Instead, the Alliance did not speak prokelive defense and nuclear restraint in the European territory.</p>
<p>The summit in Wales was the first of a series of summits, where the topics of discussion are collective defense, nuclear restraint and Russia. And the trend persists.<em>-</em> Yes, it was a heavy battle. I prepared the initial Atlantic Declaration. The intervals were difficult, especially with Canada and Germany. The then Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, was a fiscal hawk, which was compounded for money for 2 % of GDP for defense. And then many other countries hid the borrowing of Canada and Germany, because it was convenient.</p>
<p>As a result, we received a text with a typical diplomatic language where there were many of the magnitude.</p>
<p>However, we can call it success. Why? Because for the first time, such a requirement was presented for approval to the heads of state.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/5-3-scaled.jpg" />The main results of the NATO summit in Wales/ Army Infographic</p>
<p>And that was my initial idea when Anders Fog Rasmussen <em>(NATO Secretary General U2009-2014. - Ed.)</em> announced her. In fact, 2 % of the cost of defending in the past, and even 3 % during the Cold War.</p>
<p><strong> <em>-</em> </strong> <strong> What is the result of this obligation now? </strong></p>
<p><em>-</em> first, there are two people who have forced to increase NATO's costs for defense _ --_ Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. In a crazy way but trigger became(aggressive)Putin's actions against Ukraine. Therefore, many European countries have acknowledged that they need to increase defense and ability.</p>
<p>And then Donald Trump <em>(In 2016. - Ed.)</em> was elected President of the United States. He began to distort the idea that the US obligation to NATO <em>-</em> is the investment in defense. And it caused another shock in the Alliance.</p>
<p>NATO countries are still not achieving the goal, so now we can only talk about the seven units that have 2 %. I think there are ten countries that are close to this purpose or reach it by 2024.</p>
<p>When you look at the overall situation, you can give the argument a projection already 3 %. And I know that on the eve of the Vilnius Summit in NATO there were disclosures to have a target of 2.5 % as new 2 %.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/6-1-1.jpg" />This is a discussion to have 2 % not as a maximum but a minimum. NATO has the opportunity to go beyond the boundaries of 2 %. But the Alliance countries do not yet have the necessary expenses. And this is evidence that Europeans have not yet set defense on the first plane of their priorities, knowing the world we live in.</p>

<p>First of all, I congratulate our anti -aircraft missile warriors of Ukrainian Air Force, they celebrate their day today.</p>
<p>I thank you for every goal killed, warriors!More than three thousand such targets have already been: over 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, almost 40 ballistic and a hundred winged Russian missiles, more than 1600 drones of different types ... All - thousands and thousands of life saved, hundreds of objects of critical infrastructure that you have preserved.</p>
<p>During this war, eight anti -aircraft missile brigades were honored with "Message and Courage". More than 1100 joint-stock soldiers received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title-Hero of Ukraine. This is Colonel Sergeyaremenko, Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruglov, Sergey Porezets, Artem Sharkov, Dmitry Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artemsarchuk - he was assigned to him posthumously.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our state does not yet have enough quality air defense systems to protect our entire territory and knock down all hostile goals. The enemy is used as it is today - by inflicting another terrorist strike on the town of Iranian drone, in particular on residential buildings, as well as on the building of the Security Service of Ukraine. As a result of these blows, there are wounded, there are dead ... My condolences!We will make everything possible and impossible to make our air defense the strongest. Today, General Oleshchuk, Commander of the Air Force, reported on our actions. In order for the Ukrainian airboard to be able to close the entire territory from the Russian terror, and in the future - to become the basis for the European air shield. It is absolutely necessary and absolutely possible.</p>
<p>By the way, he spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholtz today. Germany was very powerful to Ukraine with air defense. The brilliant German systems "Iris-T" have shown well in protecting our sky. We have the American "Petriots" and are very effective in Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for all other vital help!Obviously, it is possible to protect Europe from any aggression only together with Zauzina and only with Ukraine in NATO. That is why there should be a safety certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will be able to refocus on its own statehood-to finally do themselves, not any expansions.</p>
<p>We are very actively preparing for the summit, and we expect from our partners exactly the most visibility that this historical moment requires.</p>
<p>And necessarily - our active actions. Advanced.</p>
<p>Heroic 35th and 36th separate brigades of the Marines-thank you, warriors!The famous 55th separate artillery brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-thank you, warriors!128 Separate Brigade of Territorial Defense-Thank you!</p>
<p>It is especially worth noting today the junior lieutenant Alexander Pavlov, commander of the Marine infantry platoon of the 36th Brigade of Marines. His confident trick actions, skillful management in battle give good results to the state. Thank you!</p>
<p>The T-80 tank crew under the command of the junior sergeant Andrei Marchuk-Thankme Accuracy and Courage!This is the 36th brigade of the Marines.</p>
<p>And from the 35th brigade, I will celebrate the tank commander, junior sergeant Artmatobrazka today-thank you for the true Ukrainian courage and skill in the possession of the settlement of Makarivka. Thank you, Artem!</p>
<p>Senior soldier Eugene Poddubny, sapper of the 47th mechanized brigade. It operates on a very hot direction and performs its tasks very effectively. Thank you, Eugene!</p>
<p>Captain Ivan Ogurtsov. Acting in the Avdeevsky direction, our firewartilers under its command very effectively destroy the enclosures and warehouses. Thank you, warrior!</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/1-3-1.jpg" />Today, the Hague has announced the creation of an International Center for Investigation for Crime Agression against Ukraine. In general, the issue of bringing the reference of Russian military criminals is among the main priorities of Ukraine and foreign partners. Therefore, it is important to understand the legal mechanisms of the process.</p>
<p>The Armyinform correspondent, while in Brussels as part of the EU response in Ukraine, recorded an exclusive interview with the European Commissariatration Didie Raineneds about the Roman Statute and Ukraine and how Russian military criminals can be built.</p>
<p><strong> - Why is the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine is crucial for investigating Russian military crimes? </strong> **</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it is very important for all democratic countries to participate in international institutions involved in the fight against international crime. International criminal court was created to organize investigations, prosecution and condemnation of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide crimes or aggression.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is very important for all participants in the process. This is the first reason for such a reclamation country as Ukraine, as a candidate country for entrance to the EU, very importantly participate.</p>
<p>I repeat all the time that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has come time to ratify the Roman Statute <em>(Ukraine has signed in 2000, but not yet ratified. - Ed.)</em>.</p>
<p>The second reason why it is important to do because if you ask to apply_(against Russia. - Ed.)_ International rules, you also need to eat with them in Ukraine. I know that military crimes in Ukraine have been committed by the Russians.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/2-3.jpg" />The world map showing the status of the Roman Statute</p>
<p>I cited an example when they send the UN peacekeeping mission to another country and is shaking war. And then it is worth making sure that persons who committed war crimes, for example, will be punished against women and children.</p>
<p>Because if the country is involved in the international process, international jurisdiction, it is easier to come to court with more and more countries that we need to support Ukraine. In this way, a tribunal will be created on the crime of aggression.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine will, of course, help organize investigation, persecution and condemnation of Russians responsible for these crimes.- Starting from February 24, 2022, Euras <em>(The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Salvation. - Ed.)</em> tried to create a duplicate mechanism based on existing tools. Eurosta plays the role of intermediary between prosecutors of different countries. So two things were done.</p>
<p>You know that because of Russian aggression in Ukraine it was difficult to obtain digital division. So, we changed the position in euro. Now Euras has created the Basudans to collect all evidence and exchange them between prosecutors of different EU Member States, the International Criminal Court in Ukraine-everywhere. This is the first step.</p>

<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/03/20/yak-mizhnarodnyj-kryminalnyj-sud-zaareshtuye-putina/">As the International Criminal Court arrests Putin</a>The next is the organization of skillful coordination of actions. So, we have a joint investigation, that is, a specific team with prosecutors of the EU Member States, Ukraine, the International Criminal Court. There is a good cooperation with our American colleagues for data exchange, investigation and judicial reversal of war crimes. A joint investigative group - the third part - will now be the International Center for Pursuing Crime Aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/3-2.jpg" />It is not only about war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, but also a crime of aggression. There is an opportunity to gather evidence and prepare the prosecution research group. Such a role is given to European.</p>
<p>In addition, Eurasa gives the ability to work together. We have meetings of prosecutors between participants from different countries of the world and, of course, from Europe.</p>
<p>Eurost plays a central role in the development of the process, as there is a collection of collection and organized coordination between prosecutors.</p>
<p><strong> - </strong> <strong> What is your position on the chances of bringing Russia to justice comprehensive violations of international law? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am convinced that we have a lot of evidence that Russia has made multi -ordinations of international law to give the first and possibly two examples. So, the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is obvious. And the violation of the state sovereignty of Ukraine is obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we try to work on a crime of aggression separately. But now the ICS will talk hard about specific violations of certain conventions. We try to give all the support to get more evidence of a violation.</p>
<p>My work is to provide all opportunities and tools to the prosecutors with judges to perform their work, investigate, pursue and judge military warriors.<strong> - </strong> <strong> What is your position on investigating the crime of Russia's genocide anti -Ukraine? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have a jurisdiction on all international crimes, including crime. There is an International Criminal Court.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that they do everything possible in the ISS for investigation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/4-4.jpg" />Of course, when you talk about genocide, it is more difficult to investigate in comparison with military crimes or crimes against humanity. But in the hands of the ISS this is possible, because in the Roman statute there is the ability to work on various crimes.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a crime of aggression under the Roman statute. But this situation cannot be put into effect, I explained because of the specific situation of Russia <em>(The Russian Federation signed, but was unattractive, and in 2016 Moscow withdrew the signature of the document. –Aut.).</em></p>
<p>Але можливе і розслідування справи про геноцид. Я не випадково сказав, що мипочали дискусію на початку березня минулого року з Євроюстом і «Мережеюгеноциду» <em>(</em> <em>Eurovist network for investigation and judicial persecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. - Ed.)</em>. We want all available tools.</p>
<p>I just want to be sure that all the prosecutors responsible for the formation of the position could go to the court where they already have to make a decision.</p>
<p>You know that in the past it was the most sufficient decision in the event of investigation of the crime of genocide in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. In Ukraine, Eco -Comand of the ISS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/5-4.jpg" />Even during the war, we intend to create a reliable decision to be sure that during life, military criminals should know that there is a rice to be a court or a tribunal.</p>
<p><strong> - </strong> <strong> What are your impressions of cooperation with Ukrainian colleagues? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the beginning of the Russian large -scale invasion, I first and foremost contact the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Also with Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and then Andrew Kostin. We tried to be very specific, and we were convinced that it was very effective. For us, it was and remains the real part of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, European and all the instruments that Ya - Litted earlier. But it was also a clear message for us that we are working for a common purpose - punishment of criminals.</li>

He notes that the number one is currently increasing the number of recent weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ukrainian air defense has strengthened significantly, first of all, it is the achievement of our people, which constantly improve skills, maneuvering, trying to predict where the next blow is building. Of course, without Western weapons-NASAMS, Iris-T, Patriot-we would not be able to show such incredible results. With the advent of Patriot, we have also been able to destroy ballistic goals. In modern systems, the human factor is minimized, they are automatic capacity. The advantages include the high speed of rockets, a long range, a pumped outlet system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Denis Rozzhny shares that at dawn on February 24, 22, firmly approved to destroy everything they saw in the air. However, now this decision is supported by a serious argument in the form of powerful air defense complexes.</p>
<p>-If at the beginning of the war we knocked a third of the calibers and the X-101 missiles, then it was considered a great success at that time. Today we destroy from 80 percent of such goals, and in some cases we demonstrate a 100 % result. This is the merit of not only anti -aircraft fires, but also mobile fire groups, fighter aviation and other structures and troops. We all work together!</p>
<p>And although now the experts are not for celebrations, and to relax through constant nighttime attacks, the anti -aircraft attacks rarely succeed, Denis Pasti promised: “Let's win!And then we will rest!And we celebrate!”.</p>
