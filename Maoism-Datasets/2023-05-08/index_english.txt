 Russian aggression against Ukraine has negative consequences for Asia and the world, so in the interests of the countries of the region to take a clear position in support of the state and the UN Charter.
This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba in the online existence of the Asia Center of Harvard University(USA).
«Азія знаходиться в епіцентрі тектонічних зсувів у системі міжнароднихвідносин, які відбуваються через російську агресію проти України», — заявиввін.
Міністр підкреслив, що азійський регіон протягом десятиріч виступав глобальнимагентом змін: його держави вибороли незалежність, перемогли імперіалізм,віднайшли власний голос і втілили економічне диво, подолавши бідність.
«Два слова, які я чую від азійських колег дещо частіше, ніж хотілося би, це„солідарність“ та „нейтральність“. Вони висловлюють солідарність з Україною,за що ми вдячні, але декларують нейтральність щодо нас та Росії. Водночас прожодну нейтральність не може бути мови, коли йдеться про агресію, вбивства,терор, зґвалтування, мародерство і масові звірства. Країни Азії мають зайнятичітку позицію на підтримку України та Статуту ООН», — наголосив Дмитро Кулеба.
Голова МЗС переконаний, що розділення світу на Глобальний південь та північштучне. Натомість універсальними для всіх цінностями є принципи Статуту ООН,які необхідно захистити від імперіалізму.
«Новий імперіалізм вже не просто стукає в двері, а вибиває їх. Все через те,що протягом десятиліть світ мав сліпу пляму розміром з Росію. На щастя, це вминулому. Росія програє війну — не лише проти України, але і проти сучасності,розуму та здорового глузду», — заявив він.
Дмитро Кулеба порівняв керівництво Росії з диктаторами минулого, якінапередодні краху своїх режимів намагалися військовою силою втілюватиімперські амбіції, але вже невдовзі втрачали все.
«Російська війна проти України несе лише погані новини для всіх у світі.Українці страждають найбільше, але російська агресія також руйнує життя,економіки та надії людей у багатьох регіонах. Саму тому Росію необхіднозупинити», — зауважив міністр.
Дипломат нагадав, що на початку повномасштабного вторгнення ніхто не вірив вУкраїну, але нині ситуація докорінно змінилася завдяки тому, що українці малисміливість, а світ — гідність.
The minister stressed that Ukraine will win, and Russia will need "generations to choose from the pit that it has driven itself." The main lesson will be that "aggression does not produce any results", and it will be equally relevant for east, east, south and north of the world.
“It is still possible to avoid the collision of civilizations. The world in which the country is supported by each other is still relevant. If we can protect together, so we can withstand other challenges: climate change, food crisis, global inequality, ”he summed up.

It is very important for us in this system of system in which Israel exists when we talk about safety, when it is a long time to go down to the bomb shelter, to have this equipped bomb shelter.

“Israel is very characterized by such a sense of freedom and re -equipment of the economy into military rails. It is very important for us in this system of system in which Israel exists when we talk about safety, when it is a long time to go down to the bomb shelter, to have this equipped bomb shelter. Israeliped to the rails of constant struggle for life. Each school has a bomb shelter that we need to do; Kindergartens also have special boxes, where children can run and wait and save lives for 15 seconds, ” - said.
She added that in this country they are punished by fines at the enterprises of those who neglect the alarm during working hours: “This is the coordinate system that we have motivated. You see, we survived such a difficult night when the greatness of "Shahmed" flew on us. And I communicated with whom I have communicated with, and they say they get used to it and continue to sleep. This is not typical for Israel, because it is a must -designed cover for safety. Israel and we have an enemy, say that we have common enemies. Since it is Iran for Israel, and for us we see that Russia is now using Iranian drones, so it is important for us to have a riding interest in the UN. Because we have a common danger. "

He also expressed the opinion that he would not be surprised if, perhaps on a month or next month, the world will see something that will contribute to the immediate drill of the Russian strategy, its troops or its economy.

 Every year on May 8, Ukraine and the world are celebrated in memory and reconciliation.
The Second World War of 1939-1945 became the largest tragedy of the world in the twentieth century. Having taken tens of millions of lives, breaking the fate of hundreds of millions of people, destroying the entire cities and even Ukraine, she paved her bloody path as well as Ukraine.
The front twice swept the lands of Ukraine - first from west to east, then splits to the west. Millions of Ukrainians have laid their lives for the sake of victory over the Nazma Reconstruction of Peace. Millions have undergone wanderings during and after the end of Vivna, which has been signed over the following decades and has been tangible to now.
The broken fates of those who were in camps or in the forced emigration of the war, the explosions of ammunition, which have been hiding in the ground since the war, have crippled and killed in peacetime, serious illnesses and severe burden of the sums of the dead to today do not let people go to the world.
The Second World War became the largest tragedy of humanity in the twentieth century. To remember it, because the war should not be repeated.
Never again!
Unfortunately, now this slogan did not work.
Again. Again.
Ukrainian and world "Never again!" did not stop Russian aggressors with their "can repeat".
And the Russians repeat. And Ukrainians stop.
The Russians seek to destroy peace and praise the war.
Ukrainians destroy the war and defend peace.
To stop the Russian "can repeat."
To win the Ukrainian and the world - "Never again!".

— Сьогодні я подав до Верховної Ради України законопроєкт, яким пропонуєтьсявстановити 8 травня Днем памʼяті та перемоги над нацизмом у Другій світовійвійні 1939–1945 років. Ми ніколи не забудемо внесок українського народу вперемогу над нацизмом. І ми не дамо брехати, ніби перемога в тій війні моглавідбутись і без участі якоїсь країни або народу. Як тоді ми разом знищувализло, так і зараз ми разом знищуємо аналогічне зло, — зазначив він.
На жаль, як акцентує глава держави, зло повернулося. Хоч агресор тепер інший,у нього та сама мета — поневолення або знищення.
— І як тоді ми спиралися на спільну силу вільних народів, так і зараз мибʼємося проти зла разом із вільним світом, разом із вільною Європою. І мипереможемо!Буде день нашої перемоги — День перемоги України. Буде!— запевнивВолодимир Зеленський.
За його словами, багато років тому на нашому континенті була встановленатрадиція святкування саме 9 травня Дня Європи — для відзначення досягнутихмиру та єдності.
— Сьогодні єдність на нашому континенті наближає нас до відзначення першогодня нашого миру. І правильно буде разом з усією вільною Європою відзначатиДень Європи. Сьогодні я підписав відповідний указ, і щороку відзавтра 9травня ми будемо вшановувати нашу історичну єдність — єдність усіх європейців,які знищили нацизм і переможуть рашизм . Єдність, яка наближає мир. Вічнапамʼять усім загиблим у Другій світовій війні!Слава кожному і кожній, хтобився проти нацизму та переміг!Слава всім нашим героям різних часів, яким миоднаково завдячуємо нашим життям!— наголосив Президент України.
