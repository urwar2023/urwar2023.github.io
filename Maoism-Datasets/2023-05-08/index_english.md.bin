This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba in the online existence of the Asia Center of Harvard University(USA).

«Азія знаходиться в епіцентрі тектонічних зсувів у системі міжнароднихвідносин, які відбуваються через російську агресію проти України», — заявиввін.

Міністр підкреслив, що азійський регіон протягом десятиріч виступав глобальнимагентом змін: його держави вибороли незалежність, перемогли імперіалізм,віднайшли власний голос і втілили економічне диво, подолавши бідність.

«Два слова, які я чую від азійських колег дещо частіше, ніж хотілося би, це„солідарність“ та „нейтральність“. Вони висловлюють солідарність з Україною,за що ми вдячні, але декларують нейтральність щодо нас та Росії. Водночас прожодну нейтральність не може бути мови, коли йдеться про агресію, вбивства,терор, зґвалтування, мародерство і масові звірства. Країни Азії мають зайнятичітку позицію на підтримку України та Статуту ООН», — наголосив Дмитро Кулеба.

Голова МЗС переконаний, що розділення світу на Глобальний південь та північштучне. Натомість універсальними для всіх цінностями є принципи Статуту ООН,які необхідно захистити від імперіалізму.

«Новий імперіалізм вже не просто стукає в двері, а вибиває їх. Все через те,що протягом десятиліть світ мав сліпу пляму розміром з Росію. На щастя, це вминулому. Росія програє війну — не лише проти України, але і проти сучасності,розуму та здорового глузду», — заявив він.

Дмитро Кулеба порівняв керівництво Росії з диктаторами минулого, якінапередодні краху своїх режимів намагалися військовою силою втілюватиімперські амбіції, але вже невдовзі втрачали все.

«Російська війна проти України несе лише погані новини для всіх у світі.Українці страждають найбільше, але російська агресія також руйнує життя,економіки та надії людей у багатьох регіонах. Саму тому Росію необхіднозупинити», — зауважив міністр.

Дипломат нагадав, що на початку повномасштабного вторгнення ніхто не вірив вУкраїну, але нині ситуація докорінно змінилася завдяки тому, що українці малисміливість, а світ — гідність.

The minister stressed that Ukraine will win, and Russia will need "generations to choose from the pit that it has driven itself." The main lesson will be that "aggression does not produce any results", and it will be equally relevant for east, east, south and north of the world.

“It is still possible to avoid the collision of civilizations. The world in which the country is supported by each other is still relevant. If we can protect together, so we can withstand other challenges: climate change, food crisis, global inequality, ”he summed up.

“The rushing of Ukrainians is not in the interests of the event. Countries that support [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina), they should be aware that the effectiveness of the event in the coming weeks will depend on the level of preparation of the military operation of such logistics base, ”Zharin wrote.

He noted that Ukraine should act "in a well -planned and prepared way."

"The beginning of the offensive without proper preparation can negate the chances of Ukrainians to change the situation at the front," the official emphasized.

Zharin noted that the emergence of information on pressure on Ukraine on the implementation of fast actions "does not contribute to effective counter -offensive". According to him, he said, in particular, the President of the Czech Republic Peter Paul.

The Polish government official noted that the situation in Ukraine is now very difficult, the reinforms depend on the ability of Ukrainians to accumulate enough military equipment to perform an offensive operation.

According to him, there is currently no rebellion in the Russian power against imperial policy or resistance against the war of Ukraine.

The Polish official emphasized that in the coming months it is not necessary to expect the war. He stressed that Moscow's actions indicate that it is preparing a long -lasting war and wants to achieve its strategic goals.

Olena Kondratyuk, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, expressed this opinion in the Eviritelvagraphon "Unified News", Ukrinform reports.

“We all believe in victory, but must be reinforced and understand that it is probably that we will have life in the future as it lives [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-izrail). That is, in the safety and constant activity and constant experience, but at the same time life is set up, ”Kondratyuk said.

According to her, we must first look at the extremely responsible state of this country to the alert system, to our safety. An important alert system itself, which orients people on the type of danger.

“Israel is very characterized by such a sense of freedom and re -equipment of the economy into military rails. It is very important for us in this system of system in which Israel exists when we talk about safety, when it is a long time to go down to the bomb shelter, to have this equipped bomb shelter. Israeliped to the rails of constant struggle for life. Each school has a bomb shelter that we need to do; Kindergartens also have special boxes, where children can run and wait and save lives for 15 seconds, ” - said.

She added that in this country they are punished by fines at the enterprises of those who neglect the alarm during working hours: “This is the coordinate system that we have motivated. You see, we survived such a difficult night when the greatness of "Shahmed" flew on us. And I communicated with whom I have communicated with, and they say they get used to it and continue to sleep. This is not typical for Israel, because it is a must -designed cover for safety. Israel and we have an enemy, say that we have common enemies. Since it is Iran for Israel, and for us we see that Russia is now using Iranian drones, so it is important for us to have a riding interest in the UN. Because we have a common danger. "

The success of Ukrainians in defense against Russian aggression is, unambiguously, anti -Dotto protruding of other aggression.

We also prepare a special system of action, which will help to change the new territory more quickly after de -occupation. We are actively working as partners to increase our capabilities. In technique, in preparations and pyrotechnics.

“Russia wants to lose. Any authoritarian regime reaches a certain cultural, and after that they cannot change something there, they cannot dislage, then degrade everything.

Meanwhile, in the Russian Federation, the process of internal transformation begins, it will mean that the program of losing Rashism performed by Putin, ”said the OP Headman.

Partners see what Ukrainians are capable of, what weapons are in our hands, which we are effective when we are acting for our joint security.

The success of Ukrainians in defense against Russian aggression is, unambiguously, anti -Dotto protruding of other aggression. The world must see that the free people are able to protect the grave from the invaders. We can - so others will be able to. If Taksamo will act boldly, just as well and as well with other free peoples. I thank every warrior who gives Ukraine this result!I thank every partner who helps our soldiers exactly the weapon needed for the results!

In general, this is evaluated within the time limits quite unpleasant - it is necessary, it takes decades to deal with such a threat. We have to do it much faster. We also prepare a special system of action, which will help to change the new territory more quickly after de -occupation. We are actively working as partners to increase our capabilities. In technique, in preparations and pyrotechnics. With everyone in the world who has experience, who has technology, who has financial capabilities to support, we will cooperate to make Ukraine again clean from Russian mines.

From the protection of the border to new safe conditions for the work of schools, from the infrastructure foundations of the economy of the real ability to guarantee our people such protection against terror that have the most advanced states of the world. All this will be presented. All this is everyday.

Today, May 8, when the world remembers the words "Never again!", We are giving in Ukraine to these words. Not only to remember but to protect. Not only to appreciate life, but to do everything to anyone who threatens life, anyone who carries aggression, anyone who resorts to terror against other peoples - that every such evil will lose.

Olena Kondratyuk, Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, expressed this opinion in the Eviritelvagraphon "Unified News", Ukrinform reports.

“We all believe in victory, but must be reinforced and understand that it is probably that we will have life in the future as it lives [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-izrail). That is, in the safety and constant activity and constant experience, but at the same time life is set up, ”Kondratyuk said.

According to her, we must first look at the extremely responsible state of this country to the alert system, to our safety. An important alert system itself, which orients people on the type of danger.

“Israel is very characterized by such a sense of freedom and re -equipment of the economy into military rails. It is very important for us in this system of system in which Israel exists when we talk about safety, when it is a long time to go down to the bomb shelter, to have this equipped bomb shelter. Israeliped to the rails of constant struggle for life. Each school has a bomb shelter that we need to do; Kindergartens also have special boxes, where children can run and wait and save lives for 15 seconds, ” - said.

She added that in this country they are punished by fines at the enterprises of those who neglect the alarm during working hours: “This is the coordinate system that we have motivated. You see, we survived such a difficult night when the greatness of "Shahmed" flew on us. And I communicated with whom I have communicated with, and they say they get used to it and continue to sleep. This is not typical for Israel, because it is a must -designed cover for safety. Israel and we have an enemy, say that we have common enemies. Since it is Iran for Israel, and for us we see that Russia is now using Iranian drones, so it is important for us to have a riding interest in the UN. Because we have a common danger. "

The Second World War of 1939-1945 became the largest tragedy of the world in the twentieth century. Having taken tens of millions of lives, breaking the fate of hundreds of millions of people, destroying the entire cities and even Ukraine, she paved her bloody path as well as Ukraine.

The front twice swept the lands of Ukraine - first from west to east, then splits to the west. Millions of Ukrainians have laid their lives for the sake of victory over the Nazma Reconstruction of Peace. Millions have undergone wanderings during and after the end of Vivna, which has been signed over the following decades and has been tangible to now.

The broken fates of those who were in camps or in the forced emigration of the war, the explosions of ammunition, which have been hiding in the ground since the war, have crippled and killed in peacetime, serious illnesses and severe burden of the sums of the dead to today do not let people go to the world.

The Second World War became the largest tragedy of humanity in the twentieth century. To remember it, because the war should not be repeated.

Never again!

Unfortunately, now this slogan did not work.

Again. Again.

Ukrainian and world "Never again!" did not stop Russian aggressors with their "can repeat".

And the Russians repeat. And Ukrainians stop.

The Russians seek to destroy peace and praise the war.

Ukrainians destroy the war and defend peace.

To stop the Russian "can repeat."

To win the Ukrainian and the world - "Never again!".

We return our country to an honest history without ideological impurities. It is on May 8 that the peoples of the world recalls the grandeur of the victory over Nazism. It is on May 8 that the memory of everyone whose lives took away the war. It was on May 8 that the act of unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht was recruited.

This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in [telegram](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6161).

— Сьогодні я подав до Верховної Ради України законопроєкт, яким пропонуєтьсявстановити 8 травня Днем памʼяті та перемоги над нацизмом у Другій світовійвійні 1939–1945 років. Ми ніколи не забудемо внесок українського народу вперемогу над нацизмом. І ми не дамо брехати, ніби перемога в тій війні моглавідбутись і без участі якоїсь країни або народу. Як тоді ми разом знищувализло, так і зараз ми разом знищуємо аналогічне зло, — зазначив він.

На жаль, як акцентує глава держави, зло повернулося. Хоч агресор тепер інший,у нього та сама мета — поневолення або знищення.

— І як тоді ми спиралися на спільну силу вільних народів, так і зараз мибʼємося проти зла разом із вільним світом, разом із вільною Європою. І мипереможемо!Буде день нашої перемоги — День перемоги України. Буде!— запевнивВолодимир Зеленський.

За його словами, багато років тому на нашому континенті була встановленатрадиція святкування саме 9 травня Дня Європи — для відзначення досягнутихмиру та єдності.

— Сьогодні єдність на нашому континенті наближає нас до відзначення першогодня нашого миру. І правильно буде разом з усією вільною Європою відзначатиДень Європи. **Сьогодні я підписав відповідний указ, і щороку відзавтра 9травня ми будемо вшановувати нашу історичну єдність — єдність усіх європейців,які знищили нацизм і переможуть рашизм**. Єдність, яка наближає мир. Вічнапамʼять усім загиблим у Другій світовій війні!Слава кожному і кожній, хтобився проти нацизму та переміг!Слава всім нашим героям різних часів, яким миоднаково завдячуємо нашим життям!— наголосив Президент України.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-08T66-00-00-04-00/317089427.jpg)The Russians continue to attempt to capture Bakhmut. A spokesman for the eastern grouping of the troops by the arrogance of the troops Sergey Cherevaty told this on the air of the National Tteleorphone "Unified News".

- There were 29 fighting collisions in this direction, 415 strokes of glowing and jet artillery and 6 aircraft at positions of Ukrainian defense workers were taken. As a result of combat clashes, more than 120 invaders were killed, 64-forced wounds were killed, a hostile T-72 tank was shot, 2 stations of radiolectronic struggle, 5 field warehouses were destroyed.

In addition, the speaker noted that on average, the enemy uses about 25,000 shells in the Liman Tabakhmut direction, the Russians did not feel the famine - despite the statement of Terrorist Prigogine.

- Such statements of the head of PEC "Wagner" are probably related to the fact that he is assigned himself too many promises to take Bakhmut and come up with these nonsense about a projectile hunger, because, in addition to the loss of live strength, there will be no victories behind it. Moreover, neither the military leadership of the Russian Federation, nor Russian prisoners already not want to replenish the benches of this organization, because they understand that it is a ticket of the war.

Sergey Cherevaty also noted that in the Bakhmut direction the enemy has lost its 100,000 live strength for the last 9 months.

- But this is an indicative calculation. I am sure that further verification is more reduced to the increase in this figure. This is natural because the enemy uses so -called meat attacks of personnel as the main method of war.
