 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is convinced that the current leader of the aggressor state Vladimir Putin with his residence as the president with his policy is increasingly isolating the Russian Federation of the Required World. The head of the Ukrainian state said this in interviewing the representatives of the Italian media during an official visit to Italy.
“It is right now from the Russia that had ties with the civilized world. It is isolated today. With his presence in the Kremlin, he isolates people, his economy, his history, his language. Everything that was accumulated in them is Winter. And it erased our relationship, because he came to us with his aggression, unprovoked war, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
The President of Ukraine expressed his belief that the Russian leader is indifferent to people - not only Ukrainians, but also citizens of his country - that is why Russian troops who have come to Ukrainian land have been demanding since the beginning of this Zaporbnitsa.
“He does not have a strong army. He has millions of people he throws up. And he had a lot of Soviet technology, ”the Head of State said.
Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the Kremlin head has less justification for his actions in Ukraine. The current President of Russia is less believed to be a society, business and even environment.
“He promised them a quick victory, and there was no victory. Everything is comprehensive, no one communicates with these people, serious business comes from the Russian Federation, businesses in Europe and the world where there is a partnership of Russia, do not want to have joint contracts. All this affects a large number of people, and they do not want it, because they have difficulty every day ... This is isolation, ” - said state.
At the same time, according to Vladimir Zelensky, Russian society is contagious as it was under the Soviet Union, and it is not ready to live visuals again, so it will press on the President of the Russian Federation.
“Every day the mood there, within the state, is deteriorating. They will press it, ”the President of Ukraine said.
The Head of State stressed that Ukraine is approaching victory, while pushing the enemy from its territory. In particular, he noted that our country is extremely thoroughly preparing for a counter -offensive.
“We are preparing very seriously. And very serious steps will be a must. I know that we are all motivated - not only those who know all this idea, but our people, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy added.The President emphasized that the Ukrainian people believed in victory, and the first important quotes will be soon.

 Victory for Ukraine is not only the liberation from the Russian invaders of all territories, but also to bring a crime of aggression against our country to just responsibility of all guilty. This was stated by President Vladimirzelensky in an interview with the representatives of the Italian media during the official business card of Italy.
Answering the question, the head of the Ukrainian state noted that one of the only pacification of the Ukrainian territories will be not enough for those citizens, which have lost their children.
"I know the people who said, addressing me," I awarded their children in a way ... They said: "We are very much asking you: not only our native land. Improve. Those who gave orders should answer. We want the court. It was designed by the court - we want real justice. We demand it, we will not sleep. " These are the old people who hid their young children who went over and died for the sake of the state, ”he said.
Therefore, according to Vladimir Zelensky, both for these people and for him as a president of Ukraine, victory is not only a return of territories.
“We are a civilized state and we want peace, but just peace. Is the right, honest sentences to the killers, ”the President emphasized.
He also noted that aggression from the Russian Federation may be different - not only in appearance, but also blackmail, including energy. The Head of State expresses that in the case of losing Ukraine in the war, Russian aggression will continue to be resolved to NATO and the European Union, and then the public states will have to send their children and parents to the war.
“I am ready for a pragmatic conversation. I think your society should be ready to know: it is better to help Ukraine, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

A business that does not want to pay taxes finds such an opportunity to look at those taxpayers, who are ready to contribute to this, " - said the headmill.

Після того як ми оприлюднили свої висновки й ця інформація отрималаширокий розголос далеко за межами України, чимало закордонних компаній, якіукладали договори з рф на поставки Т-90, швидко поскасовували угоди з росією.
І ми, як ніхто інший, прекрасно розуміємо, чому це відбулося. Адже нашіофіцери аргументовано виступили з приводу „начиння“ цього танка, показалидоказову базу, що це далеко не найкращий танк у світі. Це просто така собікупа дещо облагородженого металу. Ворогу мати щось краще після наслідків діїзахідних санкцій просто неможливо. Анулювання контрактів для рф означає втратумільярдів доларів. Ці гроші не підуть на озброєння російського війська, азначить — не будуть вбивати наших воїнів на полі бою, наших громадян, небудуть руйнувати нашу країну. Здається, непоганий результат нашої діяльності».

About this in an interview with the Armyinform told Head of the Trophy and Prospective Weapons Center for Tavian Technology Colonel Sergey Bachurin: 
“Most of the latest super -weapons are the development and modernization of the Soviet times. This applies to almost everything. From winged missiles, aircraft, rocket weapons to small arms and equipment of a serviceman.
Funny samples with grandfather technologies also happened. Among the trophy and protective equipment were, for example, helmets steel SSh-68 with modern covers(Cavers), which at first glance only seem modern, but do not provide protection against the ball.
Apparently, everyone has already laughed over the so -called barbecue on tanks of such armor. Their effectiveness against modern ammunition is questionable. "

About Tsevin said , відкриваючиКопенгагенський саміт демократії.
«Давайте подамо гучний і чіткий сигнал із цього саміту. Свобода переможе, босвобода є. Незважаючи на звірства самодержців, деспотизм диктаторів,тоталітаризм тиранів, ми все ще бачимо надію. Ми бачимо надію у героїзміукраїнського народу. Це боротьба за майбутнє своєї країни. В Україні питаннядля всього демократичного світу. Якщо росія зможе отримати територію тавстановити новий статус-кво силою, це створить небезпечний прецедент. СіЦзіньпін дійде висновку, що він може просто захопити Тайвань. Лише явнадемонстрація рішучості стримує деспотів. Ось чому ми маємо зробити так, щобУкраїна виграла війну, та забезпечити міцний мир», — сказав він.
Нагадаємо, Копенгагенський саміт демократії триватиме 15-16 травня. Головноюметою саміту є обговорення стану демократії та сприяння більш тіснимекономічним, політичним і культурним зв’язкам між світовими демократіями.

Тож і українці повинні бути солідарними із такою позицією.
— Звичайно ударні дрони — це потрібна зброя. Без них в умовах сучасноївійни — ніяк. Усі бачать, наскільки широко вони застосовуються і будутьзастосовуватись. Окрім далекобійних дронів, нам необхідні далекобійні ракети,такі, як Storm Shadow, про які було заявлено напередодні.
