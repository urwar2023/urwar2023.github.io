The head of the Ukrainian state said this in interviewing the representatives of the Italian media during an official visit to Italy.

“It is right now from the Russia that had ties with the civilized world. It is isolated today. With his presence in the Kremlin, he isolates people, his economy, his history, his language. Everything that was accumulated in them is Winter. And it erased our relationship, because he came to us with his aggression, unprovoked war, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

The President of Ukraine expressed his belief that the Russian leader is indifferent to people - not only Ukrainians, but also citizens of his country - that is why Russian troops who have come to Ukrainian land have been demanding since the beginning of this Zaporbnitsa.

“He does not have a strong army. He has millions of people he throws up. And he had a lot of Soviet technology, ”the Head of State said.

Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the Kremlin head has less justification for his actions in Ukraine. The current President of Russia is less believed to be a society, business and even environment.

“He promised them a quick victory, and there was no victory. Everything is comprehensive, no one communicates with these people, serious business comes from the Russian Federation, businesses in Europe and the world where there is a partnership of Russia, do not want to have joint contracts. All this affects a large number of people, and they do not want it, because they have difficulty every day ... This is isolation, ” - said state.

At the same time, according to Vladimir Zelensky, Russian society is contagious as it was under the Soviet Union, and it is not ready to live visuals again, so it will press on the President of the Russian Federation.

“Every day the mood there, within the state, is deteriorating. They will press it, ”the President of Ukraine said.

The Head of State stressed that Ukraine is approaching victory, while pushing the enemy from its territory. In particular, he noted that our country is extremely thoroughly preparing for a counter -offensive.

“We are preparing very seriously. And very serious steps will be a must. I know that we are all motivated - not only those who know all this idea, but our people, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy added.The President emphasized that the Ukrainian people believed in victory, and the first important quotes will be soon.

This was stated by President Vladimirzelensky in an interview with the representatives of the Italian media during the official business card of Italy.

Answering the question, the head of the Ukrainian state noted that one of the only pacification of the Ukrainian territories will be not enough for those citizens, which have lost their children.

"I know the people who said, addressing me," I awarded their children in a way ... They said: "We are very much asking you: not only our native land. Improve. Those who gave orders should answer. We want the court. It was designed by the court - we want real justice. We demand it, we will not sleep. " These are the old people who hid their young children who went over and died for the sake of the state, ”he said.

Therefore, according to Vladimir Zelensky, both for these people and for him as a president of Ukraine, victory is not only a return of territories.

“We are a civilized state and we want peace, but just peace. Is the right, honest sentences to the killers, ”the President emphasized.

He also noted that aggression from the Russian Federation may be different - not only in appearance, but also blackmail, including energy. The Head of State expresses that in the case of losing Ukraine in the war, Russian aggression will continue to be resolved to NATO and the European Union, and then the public states will have to send their children and parents to the war.

“I am ready for a pragmatic conversation. I think your society should be ready to know: it is better to help Ukraine, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“The abduction of Ukrainian children by the Russians. These things are difficult to imagine any civilized world. The head does not fit the fact that in the 21st year genocide occurs quite nearby, in Europe, where the Russians do everything to destroy the Ukrainian people, ”she wrote.

Zarivna said that she made on Copenhagen Democracy Summit 2023 in Capital. It is a playground that has gathered influential people, leaders of countries, democratic institutions to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the world.

“I told how the Russians abduct Ukrainian children, take them from temporarily occupied territories, as well as starting our Bring Back Kids UA, around which we want to unite the world to stop Russian crimes and return our children. According to our data, about 20,000 children were exported to Russia. Although the figure of such crimes can be much higher and reach more than 100 thousand, ”the representative said.

As Ukrinform reports, he said in an interview [](https://forbes.ua/money/poshuk-groshey-na-viynu-30-000-viyskovim-shcho-bude-z-podatkovoyu-ta-chomu-vidbudova-ne-bude-shvidkoyu-velike-intervyu-ministra-finansiv-sergiya-marchenka-15052023-13642)"Each of these bodies has questions, both in business and citizens. I think all three structures really need restart," he said.

Marchenko noted that the Ministry is currently actively working out how to form a conventional vision of customs reform with the participation of international organizations, in particular in terms of personnel selection.

"Because in integration into the EU [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-mitnica)It is a significant place. And a huge job has been done with respect to customs, because we already have the requirements of Ukraine's compliance with the EU Association Agreement in the customs sphere as a result of 80%, ”the minister explained.

He added that the tax tries to perform the planned indicators, and from the point of processes it is a more structured and systematic body than the customs. It also rises.

** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3694478-parlament-pidtrimav-zakonoproekt-sodo-perezavantazenna-mitnici.html)"I am not a supporter of an approach when restarting is associated with personnel appointments. I used to think that by finding professionals, you are taking responsibility in some way. And so it does not happen, unfortunate , any interaction with business is already corruption. Everything should be automated. Not because taxpayers are bad or bad business, but because it is a logical design. A business that does not want to pay taxes finds such an opportunity to look at those taxpayers, who are ready to contribute to this, " - said the headmill.

According to him, it is necessary to create such conditions in which any business opportunities will interact with state officials, except in some cases, clearly defined by law.

Currently, the Ministry of Finance is preparing relevant draft laws on the reform of the customs.As reported by Ukrinform, the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Finans, Tax and Customs Policy, Danilo Getmantsev, in an interview with Ukrinforming that in Ukraine it is necessary to reform the Bab, the State Customs Service, as well as the State Tax Service by the end of the year. In particular, in January 2023, deputies of the large -scale digitalization of tax.

In February 2023, the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmigal stated that the Cabinet of Ministers plans to reform the customs this year, which includes six steps.

The diplomat expressed this opinion in [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFmRPLN7fBQ&ab_channel=RadioNV), reports Ukrinform.

“Of course, the situation can change primarily for all players around Turkey - Ukraine, Russia, the West. An interesting "knot" has now been tied here. But, on the other hand, let's understand that Turkey will not refuse even when changing power from their national interests, ”Ogryzko said.

** Read also: ** [** Turkey **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3709536-u-tureccini-ogolosili-datu-drugogo-turu-prezidentskih-viboriv.html)According to him, despite the fact that Erdogan's competitor is the leader of the opposition Kemalkilichdaroglu positions himself more than a liberal-in-law politician, in fact it is not necessary to expect a "something extraordinary" in his position.

“Now Turkey, we say frankly, earns the war to the maximum, so it is very good trade and economic ties with Russia, and its profits grow geometrically, and on the other hand, it has very good military ties to Ukraine and also gets it here. I could not dream of this war. Will the new Turkish leader say: "No, we will be crystal and think about principles"? Nothing like that, he will think, however, to make Turkey earn. She will earn further, we want it or do not want it, ”the former minister predicted.

At the same time, according to Ogryzk, with the development of the situation in the event, the hypolitical situation in the world will change, and much will depend on how much the Putin regime will begin to fall.

Speaking of Turkey, it will probably be a cardinal, if Erdogan loses. But I do not think that it will be so so -consuming at least until Russia loses. Then, in my opinion, time will come for many things -for global security, regional security, positioning of certain countries around Russia, ”the diplomat says.

Volunteers in the KAZKA Ukrainian band also visited the Ukrainian military, which are currently rehabilitated in the Netherlands.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-15T17-30-00-03-00/1684160837-719.jpeg)During the concert, KAZKA soloist Alexander Zaritskaya urged the girls to live Ukrainian defenders in gratitude.

And the military is incredible. There was a very true sincerely resained concert in the Hague, ”the artist said.

“The abduction of Ukrainian children by the Russians. These things are difficult to imagine any civilized world. The head does not fit the fact that in the 21st year genocide occurs quite nearby, in Europe, where the Russians do everything to destroy the Ukrainian people, ”she wrote.

Zarivna said that she made on Copenhagen Democracy Summit 2023 in Capital. It is a playground that has gathered influential people, leaders of countries, democratic institutions to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the world.

“I told how the Russians abduct Ukrainian children, take them from temporarily occupied territories, as well as starting our Bring Back Kids UA, around which we want to unite the world to stop Russian crimes and return our children. According to our data, about 20,000 children were exported to Russia. Although the figure of such crimes can be much higher and reach more than 100 thousand, ”the representative said.

Після того як ми оприлюднили свої висновки й ця інформація отрималаширокий розголос далеко за межами України, чимало закордонних компаній, якіукладали договори з рф на поставки Т-90, швидко поскасовували угоди з росією.

І ми, як ніхто інший, прекрасно розуміємо, чому це відбулося. Адже нашіофіцери аргументовано виступили з приводу „начиння“ цього танка, показалидоказову базу, що це далеко не найкращий танк у світі. Це просто така собікупа дещо облагородженого металу. Ворогу мати щось краще після наслідків діїзахідних санкцій просто неможливо. Анулювання контрактів для рф означає втратумільярдів доларів. Ці гроші не підуть на озброєння російського війська, азначить — не будуть вбивати наших воїнів на полі бою, наших громадян, небудуть руйнувати нашу країну.

** The developer who was deceived by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine for almost 7 million UAH, having sold apartments appointed by the military.

Under the procedural guidance of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office in the field of defense of the alkali region, it was reported suspicion of the Ivano-Frankivsk developer with the assembly of seizure of another's property by deception(fraud), committed in particularly large sizes(Part 4 of Article 190 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

За даними слідства, підозрюваний наприкінці 2021 року уклав із Міністерствомоборони України договір, на підставі якого зобов’язувався виділити оборонномувідомству 30 квартир у будинку в м. Коломия та до квітня наступного рокупередати для оформлення права власності. За це МОУ перерахувало підприємцюгрошові кошти у вигляді авансового платежу.

Однак, підприємець не поспішав із виконанням зобов’язання та уклав додатковийдоговір про відтермінування до жовтня 2022 року.

Тим часом, після завершення будівництва та введення будинку у експлуатацію,**20** із **30** обіцяних квартир бізнесмен зареєстрував за власноюбудівельною фірмою, а з них **9** — розпродав приватним особам, отримавшинадприбутки.

Встановлено, що внаслідок такої афери Міністерству оборони завдано шкоди намайже **7 мільйонів гривень**.

Наразі вирішується питання про обрання для вказаної особи міри запобіжногозаходу.

Крім цього, спецпрокурори вживають заходів з метою відшкодування завданихдержаві збитків. Так, у ході досудового розслідування на 20 квартир накладеноарешт.

За вчинене уродженцю Косівського району загрожує від 5 до 12 років позбавленняволі з конфіскацією майна.

Досудове розслідування здійснюють слідчі Головного управління Нацполіції уІвано-Франківській області за оперативного супроводу Управління СБУ уФранківській області.

**Примітка:** відповідно до ст.62 Конституції України особа вважаєтьсяневинуватою у вчиненні злочину і не може бути піддана кримінальному покаранню,доки її вину не буде доведено в законному порядку і встановлено обвинувальнимвироком суду.

The founder of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, the former NATO Secretary -General Anders Fagrasmussen said that Ukraine should win the war because the appropriation of Rosiyia will create a dangerous precedent that China can take advantage of. About Tsevin [said](https://copenhagendemocracysummit.com/2023), відкриваючиКопенгагенський саміт демократії.

«Давайте подамо гучний і чіткий сигнал із цього саміту. Свобода переможе, босвобода є. Незважаючи на звірства самодержців, деспотизм диктаторів,тоталітаризм тиранів, ми все ще бачимо надію. Ми бачимо надію у героїзміукраїнського народу. Це боротьба за майбутнє своєї країни. В Україні питаннядля всього демократичного світу. Якщо росія зможе отримати територію тавстановити новий статус-кво силою, це створить небезпечний прецедент. СіЦзіньпін дійде висновку, що він може просто захопити Тайвань. Лише явнадемонстрація рішучості стримує деспотів. Ось чому ми маємо зробити так, щобУкраїна виграла війну, та забезпечити міцний мир», — сказав він.

Нагадаємо, Копенгагенський саміт демократії триватиме 15-16 травня. Головноюметою саміту є обговорення стану демократії та сприяння більш тіснимекономічним, політичним і культурним зв’язкам між світовими демократіями.

"** _ for health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

Three long days - and our warriors, our state become stronger. I am sure - significantly stronger.

We return home with new defensive packages: more new, more powerful weapons for the front, more protection for our people. More political support.

Italy is a good negotiation with George, Ms. Prime Minister. The meeting is quite encouraging. Meeting with the President of Italy.

Germany is Mr. President Steinmeier, a meeting with Mr. Chancellor Olaf Scholtz - especially meaningful for our defense.

In addition to Berlin, Aachen also visited. He was at the military base, inspected the "leopards", inspected "Marders", thanked our soldiers who train Nanimetskaya equipment.

On behalf and in honor of the Ukrainian people received a significant European name in Aachen named after Karl the Great. For the first time in the hall where the laureates are honored, the Ukrainian language sounds in speech. Ukrainian will be one of the official language union, I am sure of this.

France is a meeting with Mr. Macron President, long, useful negotiations. There is a new military package. Powerful. There are new political arrangements.

The United Kingdom is a meeting with Richa, Mr. Prime Minister Sunak. Defense is important British leadership in military coalitions.

Before the international measures, which are planned for the near future, are coordinated in the way: before G7, a summit in Vilnius.

All meetings discussed our formula of peace, and now there are more partners willing to go by the Ukrainian formula. There is more support for our ENV accession, more understanding that Ukraine's accession to NATO will be inevitable.

I thank Italy for its help in protecting the lives of our people - from protecting the sky for the preparation of full reconstruction of Ukraine after the fighting.

I thank Germany for the largest defense package - 2 billion 700 million euros. Iris Air Defense systems of various modifications, missiles for them - many, guns, shells, armored vehicles ...

In addition, Germany will support our country for a long time - there are 11 million euros, purely defense. Plus Germany is involved in the European Peace Fund, which enhances our protection.I thank Britain for the arrangement of our pilots. We create a coalition for training pilots on modern Western aircraft. Britain - yes, Poland - yes, and I am sure that France, other partners will connect. We continue to work on a coalition of fighters, we are actively moving. Of course, thank you for Long-Range opportunities for our warriors, for their range.

So, the main results for these days - a new weapon for Ukraine, honor of D -Ukrainians, our victory was made closer.

And we will add support!I know it. I believe in this.

Glory to all who are in battle for our country!Glory to all who help!Glove, who trains our fighters!

** _ Glory to Ukraine!_ ** ” - said the President of Ukraine.

Заяву про поставки Україні далекобійних ударних дронів прокоментував в ефірітелемарафону «Єдині новини» Юрій Ігнат, речник Командування Повітряних Сил.Він зауважив, що західні партнери надають інформацію дуже обережно, жоднихподробиць не повідомляють, аби не дати можливості ворогу зробити певнийаналіз. Тож і українці повинні бути солідарними із такою позицією.

_—_ Звичайно ударні дрони _—_ це потрібна зброя. Без них в умовах сучасноївійни _—_ ніяк. Усі бачать, наскільки широко вони застосовуються і будутьзастосовуватись. Окрім далекобійних дронів, нам необхідні далекобійні ракети,такі, як Storm Shadow, про які було заявлено напередодні.

He recalled the principle of "nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine", explaining that any diplomatic effort is centered. In addition, according to the Patel, the result should correspond to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

"No one seeks to end this war more than our Ukrainian partners," the representative emphasized [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-derzdep) .
