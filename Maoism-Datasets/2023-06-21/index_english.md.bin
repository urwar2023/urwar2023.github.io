“The enemy will not take the position easily and we must set up to be a hard duel. Actually what is happening now.

The ongoing surgery has several tasks and these tasks make these tasks. They move as they had to move. And the biggest blow to the first time, ”the message reads.

Also, Anna Malyar noted that despite the fact that our troops are coming in the harsh directions of the south, the enemy concentrates a lot of efforts in the East, it continues to step there. Because for the enemy the main direction of the offensive is there, because the aggressor does not leave the purpose to reach the borders of Donetsk and Lugansk region. So, now hot in the east and south.

The parties have agreed that it was in this direction of work of the Ministry of Infrastructure that the Taigality of Reconstruction has been activating the exchange of experience in the near future.

The exchange itself will be done through the organization of regular bilateral zooms, workshops and seminars.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-20T96-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj.png)I wish health, dear Ukrainians!

A brief report for this day.

First of all, I thank our air forces and all defenders of the sky from other defense for every confused Russian rocket and for every shotgun. Just last night - more than 30 shotguns. These are hundreds of saved lives, this infrastructure. Thank you, warriors!

Second. Today in Kherson as a result of the shelling of the invaders victims ... They were engaged in the elimination of the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack by the Nakakhovsky hydroelectric power station and were fired by Russian artillery. Eight DSSNS employees were injured, one, unfortunately, died ... My condolences to their relatives and relatives!

Every such Russian blow, every Russian terrorist attack is an argument every time, and there will be no chance of staying on the Ukrainian land. There are no killers and terrorists here and will never be.

Now our warriors in the south, in the east are very actively destroying the enemy, physical purification of Ukraine. This will continue.

Terror protection is the destruction of terrorists. And this is a guarantee that the state-gun will never be able to bring evil to Ukraine. Actually about the cetretic point for today. The first meetings in London have already begun within a conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine, which we prepared with British dogs. Discussions in Switzerland and Germany, France and Italy have already taken place. There is a work of different levels for our restoration. And we direct this work that our reconstruction, our restoration becomes not only construction projects, but a global protection project.

Ukraine, transformed Ukraine, reinforced Ukraine is a security and security guarantor, it is a security against any form of Russian terror protection against any repetitions of Russian aggression.

Tomorrow at the London Conference I will present some of the aspects of our philosophy of Ukraine. The full meaning will be represented later this month. And in Ukraine.

Together with partners and all together here, at home, in Ukraine, we must guarantee that after us for Ukraine - only safety, only freedom, only peace.

I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!I thank each of our warrior, who is now in battle, in combat posts and combat missions!Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk - you are young guys!Glory to Ukraine!

About it on your Facebook page [writes](https://www.facebook.com/StratcomCentreUA/posts/pfbid0CedsgKQwqktTgzPRiKaQHCoqsdWkc13QvNbhY5sAUBPEU7ipX5xSNnEHW7oUvD7Sl)Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security.

There is also an interesting history with the prevention of the UN to the flooded territories of the occupied Kherson region. Gennady Gatilov, Post-Russian Post-income Headquarters of the UN, stressed that the organization "should not ignore the fact that the Kherson region is part of the Russian Federation, and accordingly, for its certification it is necessary to comply with Russian laws."

Peskov, in turn, put the usual smoke, saying that the Uonians were not allowed to the affected areas through shelling.

In fact, the coordinator of the UN Special Humanities Mission from Ukraine Denizbraun has issued a statement stating that Moscow refuses to organize admission to the left bank under the control of Russia.

Moscow may not like the definition of the UN: "Territories that are underwenting in Russia"(that is quite obvious because the international community does not recognize their "accession"). Тому росія пішла на принцип і не пустилагуманітарну місію, прикриваючись «турботою про її безпеку».

Зараз в українському місті Гола Пристань окупаційна влада оголосила карантин.Тобто нічого нового не відбувається. путін, як і раніше, нехтує життям людейзаради власних цілей. Є що приховувати і кого ховати?

In addition, the Associations urge the government to review the decision to ban sugar export.

The Government is also asked to ensure the strengthening of control by the State Consumer Service with indicators of quality and safety of agro-food products, which is imported into Ukraine from individual EU Member States; and consider the expediency of delaying Ukrainian economic interests with the help of such instruments as an appeal to arbitration within the WTO and within the Association Agreement.

According to the Association, not all states abolished their institutional decisions on a unilateral ban on import and transit of Ukrainian agro -products(For example, this has not yet been done by Hungary). Водночас, у травні2023 року польські перевізники заблокували можливість перетину будь-якимивантажівками державного кордону України з Польщею з вимогою повернення дляукраїнських перевізників дозвільної процедури здійснення міжнародних вантажнихавтомобільних перевезень територією ЄС.

У зверненні наголошується, що поява у ЄС практик, що порушують умови угоди проасоціацію та є дискримінаційними по відношенню до України. Відповідно до угодипро асоціацію жодна сторона не повинна запроваджувати будь-які заборони чиобмеження щодо імпорту будь-якого товару іншої сторони. Крім цього, аграріївбачають ризики у риториці європейських чиновників щодо подальшого введенняквот і проведення розслідувань стосовно української агропродовольчоїпродукції.

"The brutal incident, which took place on Tuesday in prison for 20 kilometers of the Tagsigalpa, where 900 women were located, was planned by the gang members of the gang," - said the President of Honduras Somar Castro.

The whole learning process takes place on the Nanit Video-Book Autonomous Platform. This platform includes video tutorials, broken into modules, chatting and support, and homework.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/nasonov_roboty.jpg)- In the course, we teach all over from scratch: scheme, works with microcontrollers, programming and soldering so that people can connect all the components on their own how to prescribe the program. In the future, it will make it possible to competently arrange the equipment, and it will execute the commands you need, - said the head of the sales department Arsen Pasonov.

** The course program provides: **

· To acquire knowledge of physics and electronics;

· Learn how to collect simple schemes and complex ones;

· Search for documentation by devices and their properties;

· Learn how to program in Arduino IDE in C ++;

· Replenish the vocabulary of technical English.

The students use the training kit - a lark prototype designed to mine, intelligence or perform other tasks.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/foto1_roboty.jpg)After graduation, a person will be an expert in the specialty "Terrhamodron", and will be able to work in the IT sphere or use skills in the performance of combat tasks. Also, the versatility of the equipment will allow you to work with the construction of equipment, in which similar mechanisms, even a foreign model.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/nakonechnyj_roboty.jpg)- In military affairs, land drone is required to mine, intelligence or create a remotely controlled bomb. This equipment will help our soldiers find, neutralize and lay ammunition. The main advantage is that it is safe for the operator, because the drone is completely autonomous, your task is to program it right. When creating drones, we also took into account the different terrain, so the set is available both wheelbase and Igusenna, - said the senior teacher of the course Ivan Konechny.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/foto-2_roboty.jpg)The training kit used in the classes is practical from practical efficiency. However, even a training prototype can perform combat missions, despite the symbolic cost of 5 thousand UAH.

- All the components of the set are designed for training, they are designed in a special way so that a person is able to clearly understand. After all, to master something new to the simplest examples, so that a person is first and foremost aware of the principle, - added Ivan Finally.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/foto3_roboty.jpg)The peculiarity of the course is that each lesson in the course has a practical character. Students have the opportunity to combine offline and online training, while receiving constant support from qualified instructors.

Many military people are also involved in another developer program-the online courses "smart home", which allows you to become a specialist in security systems, land, air drones and robotics. After all, a programming algorithm, that is, spectrum and technique, is identical both in a smart home and in a ground drone.

Training occurs on an autonomous system with a minimum number of dachables of information input and information for regulating the main processes of the Ubstrone. In particular, imitation of access to the house, fire alarm, light, Internet, control with smartphone, engines, electricity. Teachers are higher technical education for the US and Ukraine universities.

All setting is printed on a 3D printer. And now the accent production on educational drones. The military who came to the courses said they wanted to become more versatile on the battlefield and to solve the issue of repairing or improving the equipment on the spot, in the field, as it will save time to save time to the road in the rear units.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T30-00-00-04-00/foto_koshuba.jpg)- I do not want to waste time until I have been treated after injury. For me, it seemed like the best option, it seems to me that until I recover, this is the best I can make a useful Tai -Victory for my brothers. Until I can run with a machine gun - I will solder!—Cloid the military with the call sign "account".

According to the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, all other units of the occupation military on the left bank of the Dnieper were not aware of the blast - committed by the aggressor catastrophas.

At the same time, the head of the GRU of Ukraine denied the information that the Russians had already placed their nuclear weapons in Belarus.

“The process of preparing for possible movement(_ nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus - ed _.)It actually continues, repositories are being prepared. As of the time the warhead has not yet been moved, ”said the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Among other things, Kirill Budanov noted the change of narratives of the Kremlin's propaganda - the vast bold bravado is increasingly displaced by the question "And what if Russia can win?" Or, "What happens if Russia is losing war?"

According to Cyril Budanov, Russian society is being prepared by the donovna reality, in which it was due to a criminal war against Ukraine.

The appropriate decision was [made](https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/Review/111536574)The Supreme Court is a complication of the court chamber for the protection(Case No. 560/8064/22).

Так, вищезгадана колегія суддів, переглядаючи таку справу в касаційномупорядку відносно ветерана війни — особи з інвалідністю ІІ групи внаслідоквійни, дійшла висновку, що положення статті 13 Закону України «Про статусветеранів війни, гарантії їх соціального захисту» необхідно застосовувати щодовиплати у розмірі 8 мінімальних пенсій за віком для даної категорії ветеранів.

Судова палата під час ухвалення рішення звернула увагу на те, що реалізаціяправа на соціальний захист осіб, які перебувають на службі у ЗСУ та іншихвійськових формуваннях, а також членів їхніх сімей потребує запровадженнямеханізмів забезпечення їх державної підтримки. При цьому головну роль вобороні України відіграють саме Збройні Сили України та інші військовіформування, які своєю мужньою боротьбою здійснюють ефективний захистУкраїнської держави та Українського народу. Відтак усебічна підтримкавійськовослужбовців та ветеранів війни є найвищим державним інтересом і однієюз найбільш захищених конституційних цінностей України.

Відповідна постанова суду касаційної інстанції набирає законної сили з дати їїухвалення та не може бути оскаржена.

Раніше Велика Палата Верховного Суду вже розглядала аналогічну справу щодовиплати одноразової грошової допомоги до 5 травня за 2020 рік. Під часрозгляду судді акцентували увагу на тому, що на момент отримання спірноїразової грошової допомоги до 5 травня слід керуватися вимогами Закону України«Про статус ветеранів війни, гарантії їх соціального захисту», що передбачаєвиплату такої допомоги для учасників бойових дій у розмірі 5 мінімальнихпенсій за віком, інвалідам війни 1 групи — 10 мінімальних пенсій за віком, 2групи — 8 мінімальних пенсій за віком, 3 групи — 7 мінімальних пенсій завіком.

Отже, цьогорічним рішенням Верховний Суд підтвердив те, що одноразова грошовадопомога до 5 травня за 2022 рік повинна виплачуватися відповідно до розмірівмінімальних пенсій за віком, навіть в умовах воєнного стану.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T44-00-00-04-00/golovna-41.jpg)A documentary about the forced deportation and Russification of Ukrainian children "Malified Childhood" was published. The project was created by the team of Ukrainian media ONLINE.UA in 2023 before the Day of Protection of Children.

In it the children and their parents told the team online.ua their own stories. Some heroes were captured, someone was forcibly taken to a wellness camp, and others were divorced with parents during so -called filtration measures. In these "camps", Russians usually engage in Russification of children, forbidding Ukrainian and calling home.

Since the beginning of a large -scale invasion, Russia has illegally exported more than 19,000 Ukrainian children, and now almost 400 has been returned to their homes.

“This is the study of the current situation and the evidence base for the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. In the movie, children and their father told their own stories. Some of them were captured, someone was forced into a wellness camp, someone was separated from their parents during the so -called filtration activities. The "mutilated childhood" is documenting the testimonies of children's crimes against the Ukrainian people, ”the founders of the Resectorate said.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T44-00-00-04-00/foto_dity.jpg)Shown in the movie History illustrates that the abduction of children from Ukraine from Ukraine is a clearly planned and well -organized process for typical scenarios: deception or murder of parents, orphans, deportation for prime -help and filtration camps.

“The portions were very small, most could not eat it, and the cutlets, like a way. After them, it became very bad and began to get nauseated, it is safer to eat more than the godfather ... ” - said the rescued children.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T50-00-00-04-00/golovne-foto-2-e1687338902566.jpg)In the capital, the premiere of a documentary about the causes of Russian aggression and cruelty "Rashism. History of the disease. "

The author of the documentary was the Ukrainian journalist Akim Galimov, who, with a team of international experts, explored the historical preconditions that have found from the Russians the nation of executioners and looters.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T50-00-00-04-00/foto-1-12.jpg)- It seems to me that many people in the world who saw the frames from Bucha or Irpen, asked themselves how it became possible that the nation of monsters was in the 21st century? Our team has been exploring history for over 6 years, and it is obvious that the deep causes of Russia's aggression are hiding in their past. Having understood these reasons, Ukrainians and the world will be able to be more prepared by Russian aggression, - Akim Galimov expressed his opinion.

*!Akima Galimov's films are collecting millions of views. The total cycle -document films "Ukraine. Returning History ”has gained about 17 million YouTube views. The Real History YouTube channel has taken a few months to the top ten of the most popular Ukrainian historical blogs.

The team started working on the movie last year in April. The horrific information of the rolling and killing of people in the captured territories that opened the postcourse were the reason for the study of the nature of Rashism.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T50-00-00-04-00/foto-2-12.jpg)- recently the Verkhovna Rada has legalized the concept of "Rashism", introduced it legally as the name of the regime that exists in Russia. Many may seem to many fundamentally new, so we call Russian politicianism, and the Russians by Rashists. However, this is a very important and necessary solution. First of all, to communicate with partners in the West, since now the signs of this ugly phenomenon are fixed. Therefore, it all goes into the legal plane.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-21T50-00-00-04-00/foto-3-10.jpg)International experts have told what ancient traditions have caused a high level of domestic violence in Russia, as a "grandfather" in the army transformed a liassian into a cruel executioner, and the church brought up the humility of their believers. The film's head hero was the comic book character, which was created by artists special for the film. It is a collective image of a Russian named Ivan. All the thoughts of Ivan's Tarapeka were used in the movie - real phrases taken from Russian social networks.

The film also reveals the topic of Russian rulers who managed to blackmail people with food.

Ukrainian and international experts have joined the new documentary. Among them is historian Alexander Alfiorov, American historian, writer, laureate of the Pulitzer Prize Anne Appelum, French historian and theologian, Doctor of History Antoine Azhakovsky. The shooting was in the US, France, Poland and Ukraine.

View Akima Galimov's new documentary "Rashism. History of the disease ”will be possible on June 23 on 1+1 Ukraine.

_ ** "** _ Thank you that we are really single in defense of freedom.

** _ Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion!_ **

** _ Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries, Heads of Company and International Organizations!_ ** **

** _ and of course expensive journalists!_ **

Speaking of recovery, we talk about millions of jobs, billions of companies and trillions of GDP. And not only for Ukraine, but for all our countries. Countries that want and will live freely despite any predation of different "Putin", whose brain is poisoned by dreams of war.

The basis of growth is always values. Both powerful investment is preceded by trust and the growth that we are preparing with you should precede the confidence that the built will not fall. And this is not about bricks, but about life in general.

The land around the world is littered with ruins that are reminiscent of the wars of the past. And, unfortunately, the policy of the inserted regions of the world is sown with painful ideas of hatred of the taretiment, which indicate the possible wars of the future.

Even though no one is given to purify the depths of human nature from the evil that, it happens, emerges to the surface and destroys and kills, but we are with you - and right now - are able to protect life and overcome the ruins after Russian aggression so as to transform the path for evil, That is, for any new aggression.

The eyes of the world look at us. And whether we will defeat the Russian aggression of Sametak, as freedom deserves to defeat, that is, without compromises about our values.

And this world looks, whether we will restore normal life so that our frequency formation to cause ideological defeat of the aggressor.

By defending Ukraine, we protect freedom, and when we build Ukraine, we will build freedom. Country, region, continent, world ... This is a global task.

I want to thank you. And, of course, I thank Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy - every country where we agreed the key principles for recovery. At this conference we have to move from vision to agreements, and from agreements - relevant projects.** So, the first item: we strengthen unity **.

Ukraine has already managed to make the European Union as one that it has never been. It is a truly value unity, which is expressed in many political, economic, sanctions, humanitarian decisions. Ukraine has activated all that silverite, for which the European Union was conceived.

Ukraine also activates the moral force of NATO. This is important for all of us. What does Svetzaraz see? Does he recognize NATO's moral leadership in protecting peace? This is possible only in Ukraine in the Alliance.

Just as Ukraine already belongs to the EU valuable space, we are already owned by NATO's security space. De facto. Just as Ukraine is already a part of the EU -joint market and goes to full membership, we are already a harrowing space of freedom in the Alliance and await only for the courage of leader -of -law to recognize this reality politically.

Thanks to the same values, we develop strong bilateral alliances with such a democratic world as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, all EU members ... And this gives us a new power in defense, in the economy in global perspectives of democracy.

By building our alliances, we protect the level of freedom that people are more accustomed.

** Second: We are enhancing stability. **

At least 600 million consumers in the world are directly dependent on our agricultural production. It is a tremendous potential for food security.

During this war, when Russia blocked our ports and destroyed freedom in the Black and Azov Seas, the world saw that the grain of Zuzraina was. Without it, there is a threat of price crises and social collapse in different countries.

We have now partially restored the movement of our food by the sea within two export initiatives. And it is a stability for a huge social taeconomic space from Morocco to Somalia, from China to Lebanon, the Fluce to India, from Spain to Pakistan ... Various aspects, various influences, Alaza - a contribution to stability.

Another similar sphere is energy.

I believe that there is no alternative to the "green" transformation of the economy, and Russian aggression has proved that in the "green" transformation - one of the key basics of security. The impact on our energy and every manifestation of Russian blackmailing is completed The whole regions of the world could depend on one supplier - such as Russia.

It is "green" energy that guarantees real energy stability.By building agricultural and energy capacity in Ukraine, we protect the world of PCChaos.

** Third point: Increase growth **.

There is no such place in the world where it would be necessary to build and rebuild many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian aggression is novoirin. Thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, mutilated industries, burned life ... Russia has recently committed the largest ecocid crime in Europe, undermined by the Kakhovidambu and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant.

What does it mean? In Ukraine, the largest source of economic, industrial and technological growth in Europe in ten or ten years. And it is not only construct.

For example, the "green" transformation of energy logically stimulates the development of industries such as "green" metallurgy and "green" fertilizers.

Thanks to natural resources and industrial traditions, Ukraine can become one of the global centers of "green" metallurgy. Plus, we have significant deposits for the modern economy of resources as lithium.

By building with Ukraine and in Ukraine, we protect our countries and our companies from recessions.

** Fourth item: Increase security **.

This war demonstrates that such effective protection against aggression in the modern world is needed. Weapons are needed and to what extent, what infrastructure is lacking, and what production is in priority, what technologies largely save lives and quality systems make it possible to make science fiction reality on the battlefield.

From the production of battle drones to habitual artillery. From the air shield that covers the whole country or even the region to shelters in each school. Ainfrastructure, which is built so that it is not destroyed by Iranian "Shahaned", to a cyberspace, which retains stability even in the conditions of constant cyberattacks.

We do all this in Ukraine, and in all this we need the experience of partners.

By building security together, we convince the world that democracy can not be overcome.

** And finally, the fifth point is democracy **.

Russia has invaded Ukraine not only to steal our land, our resources and our people. It is obvious that without Ukraine there can be no Russian Empire.

And it is also obvious that the owners of Russia are very afraid of our democracy. What?

Because democracy paves the path of the rule of law, the clearing of corruption of the diligent principle of our countries with you: everyone matters. It is very important.

Of course, democracy is in the character of Ukrainians. And we would still strengthen it, it is important what they think or do in Russia.Even Russia's full -scale aggression has not stopped our internal reforms.

Ukraine will be associated with an honest court in the same way as it is now associated. Step by step we will come.

Thanks to digital transformation, we will show the world how the state can effectively function at all without contact between the official and the citizen of Chicania. All public services can and will be translated into online businesses or receiving social assistance to any other state service.

And, by the way, we are already exporting our digitalization to other regions and countries. We have learned such cooperation with Estonia, we will continue with Columbia and Zambia. And Yauna is just a beginning. Please be sure to ask our commissions, our government officials about this. This is really an example of social progress thanks to technologies.

By February 24, we began to dismantle the old oligarchic model of economic relations, which originated in the post -Soviet period. And it is not just something in the person of the oligarchs. This is about changing the approach to economic relations.

Transparency of finances and stability of the banking system, liberalization of the markets for competition, guaranteeing equal and legitimate conditions for each suburban entity are all areas in which we have made progress up to 24 worry and which are very important now. By building institutions and continuing reforms in Ukraine, we protect democracy and keep it as hope for everyone in our region that democracy will dominate.

_**Ladies and Gentlemen!**_

By building Ukraine, we build much more than one country. We build a world that it will be in the lives of our generation and after us. Is it peaceful? Clean? Is it democratic? It depends on everyone and everyone.

I invite you all to Ukraine!By the way, Mr. Prime Minister, Rishi, we have seen in Kiev.

_**Thank you for attention!Thank you for your support!**_

_ ** Thank you, the United Kingdom!** _

_ ** Glory to Ukraine!”, - said President of Ukraine. ** _

For the realization of equipment, the Russian used the controlled LLC "Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant" in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

About it [informs](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-povidomyla-pro-pidozru-rosiiskomu-oliharkhu-yakyi-postachav-do-rf-ukrainsku-tytanovu-syrovynu-dlia-vyrobnytstva-kalibriv)Security Service of Ukraine.

Rare minerals from the deposits of the Ukrainian company are indispensable components in the production of high quality titanium. It was them that she was supplied to the Russian Federation by the naming of enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex. Among them are ** manufacturers of winged rockets "Caliber", MiG-35 and SU-35 combat aircraft, as well as KA-52. **

According to the materials of the SBU, in early February this year, the demurine mining and processing plant was transferred to the state property of Ukraine. However, Schiekovkovka has become the beneficial owner of the Ukrainian mining company still a damping invasion of the Russian Federation. The actual management of the enterprise has realized through the Russian monopolist for the production of titanium of PJSC "Corporation VMPO-AVISMA". He conducted this activity in conjunction with the adviser to the CEO of this company.

According to the investigation, it is part of the structure of the largest manufacturers armed for occupation groups of the Russian Federation, which are fighting against Ukraine.

At the same time, after February 24, 2022, Shelkov wanted to hide his attitude of pre -industrial assets in our country to avoid sanctions. For this purpose it was tried to convey the formal management of the Ukrainian mining enterprise under the control of commercial structure in Dnipropetrovsk region.

The SBU staff exposed the equipment, blocked it in a timely manner and initiated the transmission of 100% of Russian property into Ukraine's income.

On the basis of the evidence collected, Shiekov was informed of suspicion of financing, committed for the purpose of violent change or overthrow of the constitutional system or the seizure of state power, changes in the boundaries of the territory or state border of Ukraine.

Since the persons involved in Russia, complex proceedings continue to bring them accountable for crimes against our country.
