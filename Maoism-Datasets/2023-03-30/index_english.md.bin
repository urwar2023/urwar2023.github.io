The Russian camps get to:

* Orphans(Moreover the parents of some of them were killed by the same Russians); * children from boarding schools who have relatives in Ukraine, but are still forced; * Children of parents who have not passed filtration and are in Russian torture.

There have been cases where children were taken to the centers of militaristic preparation for "re -education" - this is how teenagers from Donetsk Talugansk regions came into Chechnya.

The enemy continues to concentrate his greatest offensive capabilities of the Nabakhmut direction. In parallel, they accumulate and all their media efforts of the topic of battles for Bakhmut. Actually, the information and psychological attachment of hostilities looks.

About it [wrote](https://t.me/annamaliar/600)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in Telegrams.

The enemy is currently working out a medium three tasks:

* undermine the trust of our society and military in Bakhmut command; * Demotivation and psychologically weaken our army; * provoke our military leadership for erroneous actions.

To do this, they try to shift the accents in the topic of Bakhmut and to eliminate what our advantage is a reasonable and competent planning of operations. The displaced accent is to consider Bakhmut as an apocalyptic event and to do the division of the realist "before" and "after".

This psychological trick is used to suggest the desired ideas of the enemy's inarets. When society perceives battles in Bakhmut as a factor that will affect the course of the war in a whole way, it enables the enemy to promote Winfopol's scenarios for them.

Excessively wounded by the approach of the "end" frightened society at the plan of the enemy to start pressing on the military-political leadership on the cessation of defense.

This is in the pure form of IPSO in order to influence military decisions.

What messages are now using the enemy:

* Allegedly decision to keep Bakhmut political; * It seems like Bakhmut does not make sense, almost everything is surrounded; * Allegedly, the heroism of Ukrainian fighters is inflamed by Ukrainian propaganda.

What are the two names infinitely exploited in Russian IPSO on Bakhmut:

* President of Ukraine; * Commander-General of Colonel Alexander Sirsky.

In order to undermine confidence in them and make a conflict in the military leadership of the state. After all, Russian touches do not write that military decisions are made by kind. There is a military command headed by the Commander -in -Chief of the Danachian of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. In addition, he constantly meets the pond of the commander -in -chief, which also makes operational decisions with the participation of all the warring law enforcement agencies.

** So what really happens and how should I take information about the fighting of Ubakhmuti? **

It is an active phase of war. As active as in other directions in the east, January 2023 is the large -scale enemy's offensive.The defense of Bakhmut is currently due to the operational-tactical feasibility, and the decisions are approved by competent, thoughtful and aimed at the implementation of current defense tins.

What can be defensive tasks:

* maintenance of occupied borders and positions; * preventing the enemy's promotion deep into the territory; * Consideration of significant losses; * Creating conditions for a counter -offensive.

Bakhmut will be defended as long as we need it from the point of consciousness of military defense problems. And this is our military command, and the non -Russian IPSO will still determine the defense of Bakhmut.

** And the most unpleasant information for the enemy. ** Bakhmut fighting is not apocalypse. This is one heroic page of a powerful Ukrainian army in the war against Russian federation.

The Russian serviceman tells the negative attitude of the local to the soldiers in the occupied territories and successful actions of the Armed Forces. Summary of intercepted talk:

* _ "Cute, you serve your country"; _ * The local population of the Kremlin perceives the invaders for aggressors; * _ "Here kicks many people."

For every military crime committed against Ukraine, there will be a fair payment.

For many years, Russia has portrayed children as victims who have spent the idea. From the time of the formation of Soviet power, the hero of propaganda has become a caretaker Pavlik Morozov, who issued his father's Chekists and was killed by his own birth. Later, the minor guerrillas of World War II, which were spying, pasted cartoons on the Nazis, collecting weapons of camps, and sometimes killed the Nazis. The main rule of the Soviet agit industry was the fact of "heroic death" of toddlers, which made it possible to create them with a necessary biography and ideologically substantiate their "feats".

A new stage of canonization of "hero boys" has unfolded with the beginning of the events of 2014 in the Donbass. With the help of candid fakes about the "atrocities of the Nazis", Rospropaganda solved a real information war on dehumanization of Ukrainian. The most famous fake of the time was the story about the "crucified boy" in Slavyansk, whom the Ukrainian military was allegedly executed in his eyes in his mother and residents of the city. The propaganda lie was so obvious that the Russian media were forced to recognize the fake of the plot, and the "crucified boy" immediately became an Internet meme and a smile for the whole world. After that, Russia has repeatedly spread fakes about "Donbass Children", which Ukraine seems to be killed.

But with the beginning of a full-scale war, the image of "child-victim" has turned a "child-hero" child

Thus, in the spring of 2022, the hero of publications of the most popular Russian news media was the boy "Alyoshka", a resident of the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation, who ran along the route in a helmet and greeted the armored vehicles, which went towards the border of Zavraina.However, the boy in Russia began to heroes and turn into a new symbol of propaganda. Putin awarded him with the Medal for Courage, postcards with the inscription "Fedya - the Hero of Russia" appeared on the fences of the Umbryansk region. Alessum's "feat" circumstances swept through Russia, they even joke there, every other than a baby who survived after the crucifixion of Ukrainian "Nazis".

Such examples are only part of the systemic use of children in the interests of propaganda

Increasingly, boys and girls are becoming direct participants in numerous Z-Symbolism to support the war against Ukraine. In Ukrainian schools, students tell students a Russian version of what is happening in Ukraine, about "special operation heroes", "friends and enemies of Moscow". Young people are involved in the organization "UNarmia", which is overseen by the Ministry of Defense. In the schools of the occupied part of Kherson region, students of 10-11 grades open to join the Russian army.

By the end of 2023, Russia plans to "process" more than 3.3 million Ukrainian children ideologically in the occupied territories.

** Why did the Russian Federation renew the trend "Hero boys"? **

First, it is an attempt to transform children into a symbol of Russian Z-Patriotism of the Russian confidence that "war is a revenge for children of Donbass", which justifies the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians.

Secondly, fakes like the "crucified boy" are used as an emotional trigger to generate the Russian of another wave of anger for "crimes of Ukrainian" and consolidation around the common goal of "denacification" and "liberation" of Ukrainian territories.

Third, it is a logical continuation of the Kremlin's policy on the planting of young Russian youth and occupied territories of "correct" behavior, the key element of which is the creation of the enemy's likeness of the enemy. Thus, young people prepare a mobilization reserve or "volunteer battalions" that are formed in Russia.

Manipulations with the use of children as the main characters is a bad attempt by Russian propaganda to evoke emotions and experiences in the audience and create an information background to justify their military crimes in Ukraine.

A spokesman for the Eastern Urgent Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergey Cherevaty reported this on the air of the Teleterna "Unified News".

-Today, the Russians have several directions of impact, and one of them for the next weeks is a Lyman-Kupyan direction,-said. - The enemy causes especially powerful blows there from artillery. And only for this, the occupiers 301 times struck different types of artillery in this way. There, the enemy operates with more classic units of the Russian army, which, of course, are completed with mobilized. Their tactics are rather classical, so they have much less loss - only 37 were killed and 100 in this day. However, I note that the enemy there is more used by armored vehicles, which, respectively, is also destroyed by the Armed Forces. Thus, the Ukrainian army was eliminated by BTR-80, BMD, a self-propelled tulip mortar, four 120 mmminometics and one of Russia's latest developments-the Strizh Station, as well as one-fate ammunition composition.

Sergei Cherevaty also added that the intensity of hostile attacks changes under silver -moving conditions, heavy losses of Russians and regrouping of troops, however, if you talk globally - Bakhmut for the occupiers remains priority.

- The city, in addition to the military target, also has a symbolic meaning, because such a reason as Bakhmut, I do not remember when the Russian or even Soviet army has experienced. After 9 months, not to take a district center for the army, which posted itself as a "rock army of measure" and which in advertising slogans claimed that "the granite of Rasia was not obtained by Nigde" is a shame. The Russians are strongly underestimated forces of Ukraine.

This belief was expressed by the spokesman of the Air Force Command Colonel Ignatii Ignati on the live broadcast of the Single News.

- The air forces have decided on the type of aircraft that Ukraine needs today. It is a multi -purpose aircraft that can use a variety of connections, requires an aviation platform that can meet the needs of our country, - said Yuri Ignat. - Even with the aircraft that our partners will give, to protect Ukraine in the center of Europe will still be difficult for us. Need planes, such as F-16, which can provide air protection against rockets and aircraft, as well as enhance our capabilities on Earth.

The officer also noted that the Russians use winged managed aviation bombs. The enemy aviation works from the front area and does not fly to the nail or into the area of the defeat of our air defense, drops the half -ton bombs that fly to the kilometers.

- We are waiting for the US decision and other foreign partners to provide Ukraine with a type of aircraft. When it is accepted, it is possible to prepare both pilots, engineering and aviation composition, and our aerodromeinfrastructure,-summarized Colonel Ignat.

** _ Dear present!_ **

** _ Mr. Federal President, Mr. President of the National Council, Dear Austrian People!_ **

First of all, I want to thank your three cities, hospitals of three cities - a proportion, Linz and Graz.

In the clinics, these cities were rescued by our people, children and adults, from the city of the Kyiv region, who were scared of burns due to catastrophincarl, which happened in January this year.

I thank everyone who helped the Ukrainians then!

It was an important manifestation of support when your chancellor, Mr. Nevammer, and the Federal Government of Austria proposed such assistance. In Ukraine, we appreciate every life we can be grateful to those who help us save people.

**_Ladies and Gentlemen!_**

Today is the 400th day of the war, through which our country has to pass. The total war of Russia against our people and against everything that people do people in general.

Unfortunately, every day we lose our people every day.

Those who give their lives for the freedom of Ukraine and all the people whose land and potential Russia wants to be taken to their empire. defenders and defenders. We lose the lives and health of our people from the explosions of mines and shells left by Russian terrorists. We lose the fact that in some parts of our country in the face of such a terrible region, it is simply impossible to provide medical care in time and completely.

I will only give you one example. Just imagine what it means and how many large -scale hazards brought by war. 174 thousand square kilometers of Ukraine are contaminated with mines, which the occupier has laid and Russian units of different types that have not broken.

This contaminated area is like two territories of Austria. These are hundreds of thousands of anti -personnel and protanka mines, rockets from jet artillery, aviation bombs, mortar, which, without breaking, stuck in the fields, in the remains of houses. Invatory stretch marks with grenades that the occupiers specifically left the anti -Cyvich, ordinary people in homes and cars, on roadside roads, in gardens, in the gardens, in the cities ...This is thousands. Thousands when we were exchanging. When we saved life. Unfortunately, there are reports of explosions every day that took away lives and crippled people. Simple.

And all this is part of Russia's self -portrait today, which it creates with its aggression, its crazy war.

** _ Dear Austrian leaders!_ **

** _ Dear Austrian people!_ **

Please remember: when we seek support for Ukraine, we are for the sake of saving lives.

Ukraine has never wanted or took a stranger. We are not interested in another's land. We do not want to interfere with the lives of other peoples. The Ukrainians never sought that someone on the earth suffered from the earth and even more than died.

We strive for safety, peace, freedom, happiness for our children in our Ukrainian home. We seek that international treaties, conventions that guarantee the security of peoples and sovereignty of states work. Is this a large pre -trial? Is that what you can just reject?

Last autumn, I offered our peace formula. These are specific tenpoints. Quite realistic points that are able to regain the full force of the statutoon, other basic international documents and stop this crazy aggression, ensuring the liberation of Ukraine from Russian evil and the salvation of our people from what the occupiers do.

And, by the way, humanitarian demining is one of the elements of our formula of peace.

But what did the world hear and saw from Russia in response to the formula of peace? Regular lies, regular excuses, regular manifestations of evil.

And I am grateful to you, Austrian, for the fact that your answer has become even more support for the Ukrainian people, our country, international law.

During this year of the war, several delegations of the Austrian government and the deputies of your National Council were in Ukraine. I was glad to productive meetings of Austria's Federal Chancellor Mr. Nevammer and you, Mr. Federal President when you recently visited Kiev.

I also invite you, Mr. President of the National Council, and other dear representatives and representatives of the Austrian Parliament to visit our Ukraine, to communicate with our people and to see with my own eyes to see pre -empway or in frontline areas, what Russia is today, which is carried by Ukraine and the world.

To see it, to see and hear our people. And that means to understand.To support our people now means to understand how important it is to be morally neutral to evil. This is not about geopolitics, not proficiency and political issues. This is that people are always - they must be resolved by people, always protect humanity and civilization.

I thank you, Austrian, for humanitarian support for Ukraine. Separately grateful Austrian who participated in the neighbor in the neighbor in the hardship(Nаchbar in Not).Ми це дуже цінуємо.

Я дякую за допомогу в захисті нашої енергетики від російських терористичнихракетних ударів. Я дякую за підтримку наших зусиль у розмінуванні нашої земліта в лікуванні й реабілітації наших людей після всього того, що є проявами танаслідками російської агресії.

І я дуже чекаю того моменту, того щасливого дня, коли зможу подякувати вам,Австріє, і за допомогу у відновленні миру на нашій землі.

І я впевнений, що Україна переможе в цій війні. Я впевнений, що міжнароднеправо знову запрацює. Я впевнений, що українська формула миру допоможе світузахиститись і від інших подібних агресій. І впевнений, що попри все мизбережемо нашу людяність, нашу цивілізованість, нашу моральність і нашу віру вте, що зло завжди програватиме.

Дякую всім, хто допомагає Україні!Вічна пам’ять кожному й кожній, чиє життязабрала жорстока російська війна!

Дякую вам особисто, Австріє!

They discussed how to treat different lists of prisoners that publish U -Russian social networks. The headquarters representative noted that our joke would be attached to them as additional information. The social networks of the Russian are also used to loosen the situation in Ukraine. But when a person is aware of missing persons and there is no information about it, photos or videos are taken into account.

"In addition, if a person appears on a Russian list, it means that the Russian Federation assumes some responsibility for it," he added.

There have been cases where the Russians were published on social networks by a military ticket of the military, as if they were killed, and then the person was found in captivity. Therefore, such messages could not be taken as a clean coin.

Our wounded, sick and women still remain in captivity, although it is the interest, according to the headquarters representative, should be priorities for release in accordance with international humanitarian law. Work for their liberation, as well as to return all our people from captivity, does not stop.

- At these photographs we see the pain that every Ukrainian feels - the encroached cities and villages, for the tears of our children, for the dead of military units. The maternity hospital is destroyed in Borodyanka, destaded and cleared in Irpen, Kharkiv region, darkened Kharkiv. These photos are already a story!Cefoto -fixation of crimes of the Russian Federation against Ukraine!We need to remember what pain and greeted this war in our home. Almost a year ago, we liberated satellite cities: Irpin, Bucha and Gostomel. We are now intensively rebuilding them. The step is to liberate cities in the east and south of Ukraine and we bring peace in Ukraine after our victory, " - said the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration Sergey Popko.

The names of the paintings are described by the grief and suffering that the racists brought: "Lost", "Endless grief", "It is not 1941" "stop" Eternity ". Photos are splitting the soul. They depict the destroyed houses, schools, ordinary Ukrainians who suffered from the hands of the invaders.

One of the photo works is a pregnant woman who looks from the window of the destroyed house. On the other girl standing in the center of Vinnitsa on the spot, Deriket, launched by the Russians, took more than one life. Particularly mocked the girl's photo of a girl who firmly hugs her dad - a hero who turned from the front. How much unbearable pain is etched in these robots.

As a result of the war in Ukraine, they lose their wealth, not receiving nothing but world isolation. About it [reports](https://gur.gov.ua/content/rosiiskielitynamahaiutsiadomovliatysiaproharantiibezpeky.html)MOV Intelligence Directorate.

The representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriyyusov in an interview with gazeta.ua said that some representatives of Russian elites are married to make contact with Ukraine and ask for safety guarantees.

“Many representatives of the so -called Russian elite already understand that it is a faulty mistake and a crime, and the finale will be tragic for Russia. They are going to look for options for their own salvation, ”Andrei Yusov said.

At the same time, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence noted that these "elites" will leave about the struggle for internal changes in Russia, but only take care of their own and business.

“They try to get in touch and negotiate on personal security guarantees. Such cases are already there, ”said the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Nevertheless, according to Andrei Yusov, now the most dangerous for Putinastons are those representatives of political elites who are not part of the dictator's "nearby".

“To a large extent, the decision to start a full -scale war is a consequence of their management. Modern Russia is a closed society, including inside the dictatorial vertical: there is no discussion of any of the thoughts of thoughts. The decision is made by one person, not very educated and incompetent, so the consequences are catastrophic for Russia, ”Andriyus summed up.

Four hundred days ... four hundred days of our defense against full -scale aggression.

This is the enormous path we've gone. All together - everyone and everyone who fought for Ukraine. Who cares and cares for the state and Ukrainians. Who helped our logistics. Who has strengthened and strengthens Ukrainian stability.

Ukraine passed the worst days of that February. This winter was withstanding. Colossiosilisa according to these words ...

We have passed last spring that changed the course of this war in favor of our defense.

Last summer and in the fall, we proved that the spring liberation of our Northblasts was not a coincidence. The battle for Kyiv, Chernihiv, for Sumy region ... Returns of our Kharkiv region, Kherson's return, defense of Bakhmut and Donbassuzuzu - is the heroism of Ukrainians who do not forget the world.

We prepare our next steps, our active actions. We are preparing the approach of our wins.

What is the power of Ukraine? If your intentions are good, the whole world will be on your side, it will help you.

Today, on the four hundredth day of resistance, full -scale resistance, I want to dress everyone in the world, who is with Ukraine. Who shares our interpretation of freedom. Who supports our desire for justice. Who has the same stiffness that we are, Ukrainians ... confidence that the world must be based on the rules, on civilized rules - on the rules of humanity, respect and peace. Why Ukraine will win.

Because freedom and justice, humanity and respect, well -deserved people, peace should be prevented.

I thank all our soldiers and sailors, all our sergeants and officers, all officers and generals. I thank everyone and everyone who holds this front is the front of the best protection of the best that is in humanity. The Front of the Protection of the Best Purchased You - Our Ukraine.

One, unbreakable and forever free.

I thank everyone who is in battle now!Thank everyone and everyone who beats both themselves and those brothers who are in neighboring positions!

Thank everyone and everyone who cares for our brave warriors!Thank you to all who protect our cities and return a normal life to where he was violated by Russian aggression, his terror!

I also thank all who help daughters and sons, wives and men, moms of our people, warriors and civilians whose lives were taken away by this war, Russia!

Ukraine will win on the front. Ukraine will win the reconstruction. Ukraine will defeat the argument of justice.This day, like any of the four hundred, I was as active as possible.

On connection with commander, with intelligence. Meetings on the internal situation. He made another appeal to the parliament of the partner country-to the Austrian Parliament. And thank you to Austria for what Ukraine has been heard. A productive meeting with the delegation of the German defense concern Rheinmetall ... Thank you to partners workpiece cooperation with us even more meaningful.

Tomorrow will be active too. Maximum.

We will do our best to get the day when I can thank you, dear Ukrainians, for our victory with you!
