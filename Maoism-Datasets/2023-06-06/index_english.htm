<p>A course developed by the British military chaplains and supported by the UK armed units within <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2019/11/19/brytanski-instruktory-navchayut-ukrayinskyh-pihotyncziv-za-programoyu-orbital/">Orbital Operation</a>, appeared in response to the Questionnaire of Ukraine, aimed at equipping the participants with religious tapractical resources necessary to support the staff through the most complex operations - from severe loss and to mental health problems.</p>
<p>“For me, it was the biggest privilege to work with our Ukrainian partners to develop an understanding of chaplains in high -intensity. Together, we looked at the central place of moral component power and the role of chaplains in its observation and support. They were able to teach us the same way as we were able to teach them. The ability to provide pastoral care, spiritual support and moral leadership has made a critical capacity for Ukrainian commanders. These ten capealities responded to the call of their people; They are no longer just our international partners, they are our colleagues and friends. I pray that God bless, protect and direct them after returning to Ukraine, ”said Reverend Michael Parker.</p>
<p>Much of the program was devoted to chaplaincy in an operational context, while the participants supported the Ukrainian military, who are currently undergoing a willow training in Viltshire in the framework of training of Ukrainian recruits, which is being carried out by the United Kingdom.</p>

</ul>
<p>That is why, according to him, anti -aircraft missile systems that western partnerships will be intensified in Ukraine, and will ultimately replace the entire Soviet anti -aircraft missile weapons park.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will take a long time, but it will happen, there is already a decision. It is different how to completely replace the modern systems of different radius, that is, the arid missile complexes of the average radius, a small radius of action, as well as the initial missile systems capable of affecting ballistic goals, - said the spokesman of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also noted that it is equally important to provide Ukraine with modern combat aircraft, which will be able to strengthen the Ukrainian air defense and support the Ukrainian military during certain defensive or offensive actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a key solution today. Just so no one is not aircraft, a political decision was needed, and it is. This continuous process of Ivin is sure to happen. We only want to accelerate it and attract more countries to this process, so that not only sufficient aircraft are provided to partners, but also a sufficient number of different weapons to them. I think we will gradually get everything we need today. Some rockets, bombs and winged rockets have already been adapted even to Soviet equipment, however, it does not work as effectively as it would be on Western fighters.</li>

<p>— Війна виснажує усі сторони, але ми повинні адекватно оцінювати ворога йрозуміти, що наш ворог сильний і в них не тільки більше людей, в них є більшеозброєння. І вони зараз налагоджують виробництво і, власне, поповнюють свійзапас ракет.

<p>За її словами, сподіватися на повне виснаження росіян не варто, адже зараз рфце країна, котра переходить на військові рейки.</p>
<p>— Вони фактично переключили свою економіку повністю на обслуговування війни ітому, як-то кажуть, «худо-бедно», але вони будуть мати ту чи іншу зброю. Тутілюзій не повинно бути.</p>
<p>Також заступник Міністра оборони України зазначила, що загроза з боку росіїзберігатиметься й надалі.</p>

<p>Due to the entry into the North Atlantic Alliance of Finland and in view of the further expansion of NATO, it discusses the expansion of headquarters in Brussels and reorganization of premises.</p>
<p>According to NATO's four diplomats, the Alliance building in Brussels, opened in 2018, becomes too small to place delegations of future Member States.</p>
<p>"Finland's moving to NATO headquarters will end with the next weeks of the IIsyans," one of the Alliance officials confirmed, adding that it will be samosted with Sweden, "when it becomes a full member of NATO."</p>
<p>But the problem is that none of the new delegations in the current construction building will fit.</p>
<p>Currently, the delegations of Finland, Sweden and other partner countries are located the NATO Early Headquarters-an old complex built during the Cold War, across the road on Leopold III Boulevard. It is currently used to place delegations of partner countries.</p>
<p>Since NATO enlargement has occurred faster than predicted, now the Alliances are finding a solution that would allow Finland and its future faith of 50 people to move to the headquarters building.</p>
<p>One of the decisions of the Alliance is the construction of additional construction in the territory of the NATO military town, where its international employees and agencies could accommodate. This solution is proposed as a temporary but quick solution.</p>
<p>At the same time, the problem is the cost of construction, because for the construction of a new headquarters, the Alliance has already paid 1.1 billion euros.</p>

<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>This day, which began with an urgent meeting of the NSDC, continued with the meeting. We are waiting for a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Created by Russian terrorists of a catastrophe on Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still release all our land. And every Russian thermal increases only the amount of reparations that Russia will pay for the crimes committed, not the chances of the occupiers to stay on our land.</p>
<p>First, I am grateful to all our rescuers, military, representatives of local communities, every region of our region, who now help people from our southern areas flooded as a result of the Russian terrorist attack.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authorities at all levels do everything to save people and provide with a questioning water of those who received it from the Kakhovka reservoir. Kryvyi Rih and all Dnipropetrovsk, cities and villages of Kherson region, Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhzhia - at least difficult, we have to help people.</p>
<p>Third: I am grateful to everyone who now conducts and helps with the evacuation of people, the size and villages that flooded with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. It is very important now - to help each other and to help the maximum.</p>
<p>The fourth: the whole world will know about this Russian crime of war, the crime of ecocid. This is consciously destroyed by the Russian invaders of the dam and other structures of the hydroelectric power station of the Cecological bomb of mass destruction. For the sake of its own security, the world should now indicate that Russia will not come from the hands of such terror. And I am grateful to all the leaders of the states, all peoples and international organizations that supported Ukraine to help our people, our de -occupying steps. The Prosecutor General appealed to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office to attract international justice to investigation of the dam.</p>
<p>He spoke today with the director of IAEA Grossi, in particular what happened to the Zakhovsky reservoir, the general situation with the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station. He closed the IAEA director directly and unambiguously to condemn today's Russian thermal and to maximize our efforts to release. His visit to Ukraine agreed.I want to say a few more things separately. As for our South and Crimea. We are finding a conspiracy to restore a normal life on our earth after the exile of the racists. Cestos both water and everything else. This applies to all our regions - from Kherson to the Dnieper, from Mykolaiv to the Crimea.</p>
<p>The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critical, in particular, to provide water to Crimea, indicates that Russian -owners have already realized that they would have to escape from Crimea.</p>
<p>Well, Ukraine will return all its. And will make Russia pay for the committed.</p>
<p>Glory to all our people who fight and work for the sake of our country and our Narode!</p>
<p>Separately, like yesterday, I want to mention today our heroes at the Bakhmut Napryamka ... Well done, warriors!3rd Separate Storm Brigade and 57 Separate Positent Brigade-Thank you!Thank you for moving forward!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>More than 19.5 thousand children, according to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russia exported its territory from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. In this she served as statements about their "salvation", and for Ukraine chose the tacticusylyako to be blamed as such acting against the interests of Ukrainian children. Manipulations, misinformation, attempt to shift responsibility for Ukraine's other countries, conscious violation of international law and active involvement Thoughts in support of their unlawful politics - this is what the National Council revealed when monitoring Russian resources on the deportation of Ukrainian children. The media larger prepared the reporting with the results of his work, which relied not only on monitoring data, but also on the legal basis, including the international, in this matter.</p>
<p>About it reports <a href="http://www.nrada.gov.ua/yaka-vidpovidalnist-rosijskyh-zmi-za-deportatsiyu-ukrayinskyh-ditej-analiz-natsionalnoyi-rady/?fbclid=IwAR38fBW-K4Iikigy1fEG-rnsu2Jox9Y2W0UR43qpc8hkpvjPb2Gvrbv56wM">press service</a>National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting.</p>
<p>Monitoring has covered Russian state TV channels("Planet RTR", "Russia 24", "NTV-MI", "360"), online media(Izvestia, Moscow Komsomolets, Vesti.ru, RIA, Radio Sputnik, Vedomosti, Parliamentary Gazeta, AiF, Kommersant, Lenta.ru, TASS , "Sm.news", "Bloknot.ru", "Public Service of News")and the online version of the Radio Sputnik radio station for the period from a full-scale invasion to May 2023. The National Programs and news messages were taken into account.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T-6-00-00-04-00/deportation-3-scaled.jpg" />Data from open sources, mainly from the EUVSDISINFO resource, and materials of research institutes, expert groups, authorized international representatives and missions, were used to refute narratives and misinformation. Human rights, puzzle crimes against humanity, related to the forced movement and/or deportation of Ukrainian children to the Russian Federation.From the point of view of international law, deportation of children is one of the six serious orders against children in the face of military conflicts. The UN Security Council approved the UN 1261 of the UN in 1999, which described six serious violations against children during armed conflict. These violations are released from the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, international human rights, and Geneva Conventions(inclusive protocols to them), Roman Statute and the Convention on Rights [3]. Therefore, when Russia performs the abduction or admiration of children, it is toponed the Geneva Conventions, and commits war crimes and anti -moments.</p>
<p>The first report on how Russia exports to its territory Ukrainian children appeared in the Russian media on February 21, 2022. Further such reports on "evacuation", rehabilitation and adoption or "design" of Ukrainian children in Russian families, their upbringing(In fact, re -education)Information in Russian information regularly.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T-6-00-00-04-00/deportation-4-scaled.jpg" />The analysis of Russian media resources made it possible to evaluate the pattern of stories of the Russian media in the context of deportation of children and determine their intelligence and systematicity.</p>
<p><strong> Yes, it is clear that </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>15 out of 20, the media monitoring and analysis of the media, which justifies Russia's misconduct in the context of deportation of Ukrainian children; * 11 out of 20 - disseminated information that discredits Ukraine in the context of protecting Ukrainian children from the consequences of war and deportation; * 17 out of 20-disseminated information that discredit Western powers, allies of Ukraine and partner organizations in the context of protection against the consequences of war; * 10 out of 20 - resorted to the dissemination of information in all the directions given(discredited Ukraine, Western countries and justified the actions of).</li>
</ul>
<p>Транслюють позицію російської держави офіційні посадовці. З допомогою ЗМІ воничасто поширюють неправдиву інформацію, формують наративи для виправдання своєїполітики і формування лояльного ставлення російського народу до депортаціїукраїнських дітей і будь-яких дій російського уряду щодо цього. Це сприяєпідтримці політики депортації Росією не лише у межах самої російськоїфедерації, але й на тих територіях, де досі працюють або на які поширюють своюдіяльність російські медіа. Тому російські медіа — це співучасники злочинноїдіяльності рф у контексті депортації дітей, оскільки вони підтримують іпоглиблюють злочинну депортацію.</p>
<p>In general, in the rhetoric of Russian high -ranking officials, the justification of the criminal deportation of Ukrainian children is due to the formation of the idea that Russia actually has only good intentions and seeks to save Ukrainian children with the renovated threat - Nazism and/or fascism.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/deportation-5_2-scaled.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T-6-00-00-04-00/deportation-5_2-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

Так, післявидання Міжнародним кримінальним судом ордеру на арешт президента росії в.путіна саме через депортацію українських дітей, російські ЗМІ почали ширитиповідомлення в дусі конспірологічних «змовницьких» теорій про те, що беззаступництва росії українські діти потрапили би або до рук європейськихпедофілів, або чорних трансплантологів.</p>
<p><strong>Було виділено такі наративи російської пропаганди в контексті депортаціїукраїнських дітей росією:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>викрадення Росією українських дітей — абсурдна містифікація;  * ордер на арешт, виданий МКС (International Criminal Court)Against Putin, she puts new challenges to the chances of peace; * The Secret Society of Pedophiles Awesters Putin under the ISS Order; * The ISS warrant was issued for the arrest of Putin because Western sanctions do not work; * The evacuation of children from Ukraine occurs in accordance with humanitarian law.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the report on the monitoring of the National Council, some units have been submitted to such topics in Russian propaganda, such as adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian families and abrasion of national identity of Ukrainian children. The regulator came to the conclusion about the obvious and in fact confirmed by the deportation and abrasion of the national identity of Ukrainian children. That is why the term "forced deportation" should be used in the context of the export of Ukrainian children.</p>
<p><strong> According to the results of monitoring and analyzing materials of the Russian change council the following conclusions: </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T-6-00-00-04-00/deportation-8-scaled.jpg" />Distributed by Russian officials and media information is a predominant depository, which in all cases either discredit Ukraine and its allies, or justifies Russia's actions in the context of deportation of children, or resorts to these two techniques at the same time. The reception of the dichotomy "My-Vona" in the Russian information environment of Ukrainian children is typical of warning the waters and propaganda of war.</p>
<p>The Russian media form an information isolated from objective reality, in which Russia plays the role of a state that "saves" and acts good, Aukraine and Western countries that oppose Russia is evil.

<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky said this at a press conference in Kyiv, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“I think the best guarantee is the Alliance membership. Because none of the Alliance Member States fights with the Russian Federation and other states.

First of all, it will be on financial guarantees, strengthening the budget and assistance from international partners for social payments. “These are sanctions. Let us be different in different ways, but there are a large number of packages that are used. There are "disadvantages", but still there are much more "advantages". They support and beat the Russian economy, ”the President said.</p>
<p>In addition, he added, the guarantee is the supply of weapons. No matter how difficult it was, the head of state emphasized, but so many weapons our country has never been small. “Military Guarantee. I believe that this is not on papers today. It does not have it. So if I was asked what guarantees we needed, then we need guarantees. If we are not in NATO yet. If someone does not not in NATO, we need it on paper. For what? My opinion is very simple: in half a year or a year, one of the leaders does not start narratively that our society is tired, the economy is tired, so we cannot give us the appropriate volumes, ”Zelensky said.</p>
<p>The President once again stressed that our country expects to receive a clear signal at the NATO summit in the summer.</p>

The head of state emphasized that the authorities on all sites draws attention to the fact that it adequately perceives the situation and does not require membership in the Alliance until the war continues. “We do not want to split a shame and that society will share so many challenges.

<p>"Now we have to restrain ourselves in the desire to be super -sacrificing - even a high -ranking of a high rank of some European structure calls the figure, we will give everyone a pass, we check it, because it can be a mistake, some prepared document. Standards have become even more valuable than they were even valuable," She emphasized.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent, this opinion was expressed by the presidential congress of Ukrainians of Canada Alexander Khichi.</p>
<p>“The undermining of the Kakhovsky dam is compromising the security of the nuclear power plant, which is an act of nuclear terrorism. Canada and our allies have to find out the Russian Federation by the state-existence of terrorism and introduce the universities that will disable the Russian military machine, ”she said.</p>

<p>This was discussed during a panel discussion to the journalist Day, which took place in Ukraine-Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"The media market will change. For example, we are almost completely losing print media. Regional newspapers in the format in which they were before the war will already be turned on the market. It is impossible on the economic side, as well as from mediamania: the audience is unlikely which was the beginning of a full -scale invasion, " - said the founder and executive director of NGO" Ukrainian Institute of Media and Communication "Diana Dutsyk.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-06T20-10-55-03-00/1686067243-166.jpg" />She predicts that after the war, print media will have format almanacs, which will contain analytics and journalism and come out with some periodicity. Instead, the news format will move to online space.</p>

<p>At the same time, the deputy chief of "Detector-Media" and the chairman of the supervisory board of the Council of Broadcasting Svetlana Ostap expressed the opinion that after the war increased the roll of production in media groups that will produce content. According to her, they work to an international level thanks to cooperation with Western partners, as well as seek to sell content west because the Russian market is closed for them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-06T20-10-55-03-00/1686067302-179.jpg" />"There will be a reference to local media, because there will be a lot of money in the reconstruction of Ukraine before money is spent in the regions. I am sure that they will help media ladons that do it now, but subject to compliance with magazine standards," Ostap said.</p>

<p><strong> Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>This day, which began with an urgent meeting of the NSDC, continued with the meeting. We are waiting for a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Created by Russian terrorists of a catastrophe on Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still release all our land. And every Russian thermal increases only the amount of reparations that Russia will pay for the crimes committed, not the chances of the occupiers to stay on our land.</p>
<p>First, I am grateful to all our rescuers, military, representatives of local communities, every region of our region, who now help people from our southern areas flooded as a result of the Russian terrorist attack.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authorities at all levels do everything to save people and provide with a questioning water of those who received it from the Kakhovka reservoir. Kryvyi Rih and all Dnipropetrovsk, cities and villages of Kherson region, Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhzhia - at least difficult, we have to help people.</p>
<p>Third: I am grateful to everyone who now conducts and helps with the evacuation of people, the size and villages that flooded with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. It is very important now - to help each other and to help the maximum.</p>
<p>The fourth: the whole world will know about this Russian crime of war, the crime of ecocid. This is consciously destroyed by the Russian invaders of the dam and other structures of the hydroelectric power station of the Cecological bomb of mass destruction. For the sake of its own security, the world should now indicate that Russia will not come from the hands of such terror. And I am grateful to all the leaders of the states, all peoples and international organizations that supported Ukraine to help our people, our de -occupying steps. The Prosecutor General appealed to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office to attract international justice to investigation of the dam.</p>
<p>He spoke today with the director of IAEA Grossi, in particular what happened to the Zakhovsky reservoir, the general situation with the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station. He closed the IAEA director directly and unambiguously to condemn today's Russian thermal and to maximize our efforts to release. His visit to Ukraine agreed.I want to say a few more things separately. As for our South and Crimea. We are finding a conspiracy to restore a normal life on our earth after the exile of the racists. Cestos both water and everything else. This applies to all our regions - from Kherson to the Dnieper, from Mykolaiv to the Crimea.</p>
<p>The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critical, in particular, to provide water to Crimea, indicates that Russian -owners have already realized that they would have to escape from Crimea.</p>
<p>Well, Ukraine will return all its. And will make Russia pay for the committed.</p>
<p>Glory to all our people who fight and work for the sake of our country and our Narode!</p>
<p>Separately, like yesterday, I want to mention today our heroes at the Bakhmut Napryamka ... Well done, warriors!3rd Separate Storm Brigade and 57 Separate Positent Brigade-Thank you!Thank you for moving forward!</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>The Kremlin now applies the internal reserves of its army to suppress the rebels, but it is no longer possible to hide this conflict.</p>

<p>“In recent months, these events have only been gaining momentum. The geography of the rebels is increasing, the number of participants in these actions increases, and finally, not only the individual events in Belgorod region should be considered, but in general, called the Russian Federation today is an incapable state, in the middle of a huge number of conflicts. The central government is inadequate, and the events are demonstrated by the events. Everything is capable of concentrated Ukrainian territories, and in the territory of Russia itself-a disorder, chaos, anarchy and powerlessness. This means that such conflicts can spread in different bies of this territory, which is now called the Russian Federation, ”said the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, adding that the events will affect the essential region of Russia.</p>
<p>Andriy Yusov also confirmed that the Kremlin does not throw troops from Ukraine at present, but tries to limit himself to the internal resources of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“There is information about the preparation of such measures. But the fact that they are eating their own armed forces, including army aviation, artillery - this fact is proven, and accordingly to hide that nothing is happening, the Putin regime is simply unable to be able, ”Andrey Yusov said.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marinka has been a sacred city that they "have" to capture for them since 2014, - says Valery Shershn. -They are trying to take Mightynka at any cost, but our defenders do not give them this opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the spokesman, more than a week ago, the Cadyrivs appeared. The so-called "Akhmat Severe" replaced the Storm Z Storm. The daring at the beginning of the head, which did not lack the motivation, receiving a decent repent, quickly lost their warrior morale and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>However, so far the enemy is still trying to accomplish the task of capturing Marinka, going on the storms of the city with the use of heavy equipment - prestigiously outdated samples of Soviet production. For the most part, the tactics are not aware: if the Cadyrivsky Rosgardians come from one flank, then the units of regular Rosarmia.</p>
<p>However, very indicative of the moral and psychological state in the ranks of the invaders of Yetoi the fact that, having suffered losses, they without any hesitation throw their wounded and retreat. Instead, our defenders have everything - both motivation and morale - at the highest level.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T70-00-00-04-00/afc3449-nova-kahovka690.jpg" />In the actions of a terrorist state, Russia has no way in the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, the military analyst Colonel Petro Chernik is convinced. A well -known military expert expressed his though(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news."</p>
<ul>
<li>From a military point of view, it has no coefficient of utility, - says the officer. - The enemy believes that in this way he can enlarge the dill, because he is terribly afraid of our counter -offensive. But there is one very serious moment. We try to look at the enemy - rational, European, civilized, humanistic eyes, and this is a deep -tale. Let's remember the "series" that happened in Chernobayivka. Healthy people, Homo sapiens, could not have so often place forces as they know that they will be destroyed!So, if you try to put yourself in a place, they have rationality - not like ours. They do not understand the war reality that is around them, and believe that such acttororism, and this is a classic act of terrorism, they can achieve some goal ...</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, according to a military scientist, the enemy has achieved a very serious strategic result: now all Europe has finally realized that new Huns have emerged every East. New barbarians that cannot be negotiated with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding how environmental problems are sensual to the West, we have a westerly serious argument that we need to be given more and more weapons, because in a different way this beast does not quench, - states the candidate's sciences Petro Chernik.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that the consequences of the act of ecocide that made these barbarians will also hit them with themselves, the new Huns did not worry at all. Petro Chernik proposes to compare this with another known historical event of a similar scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the forty -first year, the Zaporizhzhya hydroelectric power station was blown up, - the officer reminds. —This, while flooding a huge number of their own troops. Substituted sources, which should be treated quite biased, give a figure of at least 20 thousand personnel. And those people who organized the blasting of Moscow were arrested immediately, because the local NKVD network was considered a diversion. They were then explained that it was not a diversion that it should be, and it was grounded. And such examples as they act, not considering with their own own, are just many.- As? - Asks the analyst and answers immediately - everything is very simple: it is not possible to protect the strategic object!So, the search for the guilty continues, and it will see that it will be a reindeer. This is, of course, a very conspiracy version, but Iii should be considered as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expert on his fingers explains how pattern the Russians work today, using classic grandfather techniques. As an example, Bakhmut is the classic large infantry shafts. Similarly - in the case of blasting of hydroelectric power plants.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing new: Stalin, Zhukivshchyna in the classical design, - says Petro Chernyk. - And somehow George Patton asked Zhukov: "How do you decide the testing of minefields?" - "Yes, very simple: a few divisions and then tanks." So - what is new? Nothing new!We need to learn to look at them something as people who were not humanized were not civilized - as a special kind of homo sapiens, who did not grasp the highest level intellectual development in the civilization sense of the word. That is, to work to move ourselves to their place, and then, perhaps, we will find a thuwa Satan's logic that a normal mind cannot understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summarizing, Colonel Petro Chernik says that there is another someholic news for us. After all, through the undermining of the hydroelectric power plant, the enemy will be forced to enlist his line of defense, and most importantly - his artillery away from the line of recovery. And from now on, for example, Kherson will get far from the abominable calibers.</p>
<ul>
<li>This reaffirms the idea that the one who has undermined does not have a single mold to the local army, and these army themselves, those who in the trenches, have even disintegrated what could happen, - the officer explains his opinion. - And this is the argumentary benefit that the Kremlin's towers are happening, and this undermining is a special act of action that we can now fully see. The topic should be managed, there should be a lot of serious critical material in the context of all the events that will take place in the coming days of the Months, and then we will probably really find some correct assessment of this. But I will confirm my main position: Moscow imperialism is in Stanistracegic agony, because when the army is conventionally well equipped, trained, able to be able to, it will never succeed in life with such acts of terrorism. They will be ordinary weapons. Fear of swamps is growing in a global context, it is fine.</li>

<p>“There is a very decent rehab system in Ukraine, although there are nuances related to the terms of physical rehabilitation(не всі можуть із цим впоратись за відведенідва-три місяці)… Another problem is prosthetics and prostheses themselves. The manufacture of the so -called sleeve, or a stump as it is called, can spend too much time. First, they do a plaster cast, then the product itself is sharpened from the plastic, then they are adjusted and corrected already.</p>
<p>This process can be long and quite painful. After all, you all over this time you are somehow, you go and listen to your own body - that, as, and most importantly, the detobi presses, rubbed and so on. For those who are prosthetic in Ukraine, it is advisable to visit several prosthetic enterprises to find what is right what is right for you, ”Danylo Ishchenko shares her experience.</p>
<p>He also said that in the US, namely in Protez Foundetion, where it is at this time reaping under a special rehabilitation program, they use more recent prostheses. For example, they do not make a plaster cast here, they prepare a plastic shape directly on the client's stump. “Now I have already received two sets of feet - one ordinary, and one more - sports. I am already coming!I reset the video, ”Daniloishchenko told the Armyinfor correspondent.</p>

<p>At the request of the leaders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">Telernorphone</a> «Єдині новини»речник об’єднаного пресцентру Сил оборони Таврійського напрямку капітанВалерій Шершень більш детально розповів про бої в районі відповідальності тапро те, які населені пункти наразі найбільше потерпають від обстрілівокупантів.</p>
<p>— Загалом на Таврійському напрямку протягом доби зафіксовано понад 430обстрілів, — говорить офіцер. — Найбільше — на Донеччині. Також ворог завдавававіаційних ударів у районі Авдіївки та поблизу населеного пункту ВеликаНовосілка Донецької області.</p>
<p>Водночас, свідчить капітан Валерій Шершень, активність ворожої авіації дорогокоштувала противнику. Адже на цьому ж напрямку наші захисники збили ворожийгелікоптер Ка-52.</p>
<p>За словами речника, на Запорізькому напрямку противник продовжує оборонні дії.В очікуванні нашого контрнаступу, основні зусилля тут він спрямував напідтримання своїх підрозділів у постійній бойовій готовності, продовжуєфортифікаційне обладнання своїх рубежів та позицій військ, встановлює мінно-вибухові загородження.</p>
<p>Протягом доби ворог здійснив обстріли населених пунктів Бурлацьке, Новосілка,Зелене Поле, Новопіль та Темерівка Донецької області, продовжує тероризуватиміста та села на лінії зіткнення і у Запорізькій області. Тут він обстрілявнаселені пункти Ольгівське, Полтавка, Малинівка, Гуляйполе, Залізничне,Гуляйпільське, Чарівне, Білогір’я, Малотокмачка, Новоданилівка, Преображенка,Новоандріївка, Щербаки, Степове та Кам’янське.</p>
<p>Потужна вогнева відповідь українських захисників окупантам стала причиноютого, що протягом доби їхні втрати на Таврійському напрямку склали понад 330осіб, із яких 128 — безповоротні.</p>
<p>— Лише у районі міста Мар’їнка вбито 70 окупантів, серед санітарних втратворога — 198 осіб, полонених — семеро.</p>
<p>З-поміж 55 знищених та пошкоджених на цьому напрямку одиниць російськоївійськової техніки — зокрема, станції РЕБ «Поле-21» та «Свєт», 2 одиниці ЗРК«Бук-М1», причіпна гаубиця «Мста-Б» тощо.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T77-00-00-04-00/foto1.jpg" />The ArmyInform has already reported that thanks to the Protest Protest Prosthetics Prosthetics project, the All -Ukrainian Program for Intensive Training of Prosthetics and Reactory Experts is planned in Lviv. And so, the US-British team of Tophachiv on prosthetics and rehabilitation came to the city of Leo: Jonathan Batzdorf, Lorabers, Kate Sherman and Eddie Leopoldo Fuentz.</p>
<ul>
<li>A week for leading foreign experts in prosthetics and rehabilitation, when the amputation of the lower extremities began with the exchange of experience with Ukrainian jackets, - said Protez Hub President Antonina Kumka in conversation. -The participation of 10 domestic prostheses and 20 physical therapists from different regions of the country, who work primarily with veterans of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which lost the lower extremities, participate in the All-Ukrainian Program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prosthetists will master the effective prosthetics technology with complex patterns at the thigh level. Physical therapists will be taught by the image for early verticalization, as well as the principles of prosthetic rehabilitation and training of walking veterans of war, which have lost their lower extremities.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T77-00-00-04-00/foto2.jpg" />"No prosthesis can return to a person who has lost the limb, the life that she had to injure," says Jonathan Batzdorf. - Whatever technologies will be used. But the prosthetic should not be indifferent. When a person thinks that a specialist is not indifferent, it is a lot of success. I do not care. We do not care.</p>
<p>According to Antonina Kumka, Jonathan Batzdorf is an American certified prosthetist-orthostist who since 2014 has been actively helping to develop limb prosthetics in Ukraine. And this time, Jonathan took advantage of the opportunity, and again came to us to share his experiences with his colleagues and prosthetics.</p>
<p>Batzdorf is the president of Prosthetika and the former President of the Orthosthesis Prosthetists in the United States. He is one of the directors of the world's orientation union and heads the Expert Committee of the Protez Hub Expert Committee, and is its technical director.</p>
<p>In addition, Jonathan is constantly organizing and participating in humanitarian and educational missions for orning-orsthetics in Ghana, Lithuania, Haiti, Tanzania, Colombia and Mexico.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T77-00-00-04-00/foto3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Equally experienced are Eddie Leopoldo Fuentz-a prosthetist-orthoisteist with a great experience, a member of the Union of Orthoistellists of the World Union.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T77-00-00-04-00/foto4.jpg" />-Eddie lives and works in Guatemala, but worked for a long time as a dentist-orientist in health care facilities and prosthetic clinics,-reporting. - An interesting letter of Fuentz, published in 2012 in one span on international humanitarian missions, where he explains why such immisia should be planned qualitatively and not at the detriment of local specialists.</p>
<p>Eddie arrived in Ukraine to help despite the fact that one way takes three days. After all, his knowledge and experience are extremely valuable to Ukrainian colleagues. However, today domestic specialists will be able to repair foreign colleagues.</p>

The head of state said this during communication with media representatives on the occasion of the journalist.</p>
<p>He noted that Ukrainian intelligence reported on the mining occupants of the Kakhovsky Hydroe Dams and the risks associated with these Russians.</p>
<p>“It is very important that we have understood such risks in advance. It is very important that the SES -based teams and local teams were prepared. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was preparing for appropriate things, ”Vladimirzelensky said.</p>
<p>The President stressed that the blasting of the Kakhovsky hydroelectric power station has caused serious natural, social and humanitarian challenges. In particular, it is expected to flood35-80 settlements. The issue of providing local water with drinking water, which will need not only in the flooded territories, but also in the neighboring regions, is now being resolved.</p>
<p>“The consequences of the tragedy will be clear in a week. When the water goes, it is clear that it is left there and what will happen next. In parallel, all teams work, all in place, ”the head of state added.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky also talked about the steps taken by Ukraine in the international arena, in particular in order to hold the guilty guests in the Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>“We connect everyone: at the level of heads of states, heads of government. The question is first and foremost help, but to record(The wickers of the aggressor. - Ed.). Це велика різниця»,– сказав Президент.</p>
<p>Глава держави зазначив, що Україна поінформувала про черговий злочин Росіїкраїни Європейського Союзу й НАТО, ініціює скликання засідання Ради БезпекиООН, а також звертатиметься до Міжнародного кримінального суду.</p>
<p>«На наш погляд, це злочин, Генеральна прокуратура вже зареєструвала це. Вінбуде з доказами. Є сучасна класифікація – екоцид. Ми працюватимемо в цьомунапрямі. Це дуже важливий момент, на який я хотів би, щоб міжнародна спільнотазвернула увагу. І я зараз концентруватиму наших дипломатів на роботі саме здержавами, які займають посередницьку позицію. Особливо це ті держави, якіприділяють багато уваги екопитанням і ековикликам», – сказав ВолодимирЗеленський.</p>
<p>Він висловив сподівання, що на злочин екоциду відреагують країни ЛатинськоїАмерики та Азії, а також відповідні міжнародні організації.</p>

<p>According to the events that took place at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, today there is a completely completely ill one hundred percent result of the knocking down of enemy winged missiles during the next Kremlin missile attack. About it in the studio of the Telelorphone "Unin" in direct <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">ether</a>Recall the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Yuri Ignat.</p>
<ul>
<li>35 out of 35 rockets were destroyed. Basically, they went to Kiev-these are the X-101 Tach-555 missiles, although other regions were also attacked,-the officer notes. —The hundred percent worked both the Center Air Command, and a brigade that encourages, in particular, the sky of Kyiv region. These are the heroes of our time, it is really necessary to thank all the guys who, with the help of both the technique that we have provided to us, and yet Soviet technology defend the central Ukraine of a Compile Terrorism of Russia. 35 of 35 - it is possible that there were more such results, and in general, that there would never be any attacks on Ukraine. But for this, so that we need to intensify, we need more weapons to reflect these attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked by the leading live broadcasts on a certain logic of the enemy, the algorithm, which uses, planning and carrying out air attacks, Colonel Yuri Ignatius reported that there is no need to look for logic: the enemy is misleading, trying to outwit, resort to new tactical techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even the same chess, - explains the head of the public communion service of the Air Force. - They constantly modify them, make some sure refinements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the current schemes of the enemy of the aids, as an example, Colonel Yuri Ignat cited one of the latest mass air attacks. This time the enemy was first applied, from about 23.30 to the fourth one, Shahda, then, in the morning, winged missiles. Accordingly, rockets are being fired, and, in the afternoon, about 11 o'clock, it is a browsing bolist - that is, the Russians hoped that we would not be ready, that we would not have time to recharge and change positions, so they cause insidious mansions.</p>
<ul>
<li>But, as you can see, we worked and did not let the enemy do it, - a summary. - Accordingly, the enemy will continue to always look for ways, as a way out of air defense, and we will look for methods to counteract them - there is no other variant.</li>

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told this during communication with media offers on the occasion of the journalist.</p>
<p>“We have returned 2.5 thousand people, of which about 370 children and about 150 -civilians(adults. - Ed.). Тобто 550 людей із 2500 — це діти й цивільні. Цеті, кого вдалося повернути», — повідомив Глава держави.</p>
<p>Як зазначив Президент, складність повернення з полону цивільних полягає втому, що Україна не має такої кількості російських цивільних, яких можнаобміняти на українських громадян, як це відбувається у випадку з обмінамивійськовополоненими.</p>
<p>Водночас він наголосив, що робота в напрямі звільнення цивільних українців ізросійського полону триває — це окремий трек у межах Координаційного штабу зпитань поводження з військовополоненими.</p>
<p>«Там Лубінець більше займається цивільними. І зараз іще відкрився центр щодоповернення наших діточок. Там є дуже потужна програма. Вони вже повернулипонад 300 дітей. Це інший трек. Вони всі — одна команда, але це різні треки»,— сказав Володимир Зеленський.</p>
<p>За словами Президента, міжнародні партнери України теж долучені до процесузвільнення українських полонених. Зокрема, Туреччина допомагає у визволеннівійськовополонених, також залучена Саудівська Аравія.</p>
<p>«З боку Туреччини знають, що питання кримських татар — на них… Я з нимиговорив іще до повномасштабного вторгнення, ще коли в мене був перший візит доТуреччини, познайомилися з Ердоганом, і я тоді привіз йому список усіхкримських політв’язнів. Потім оновлював. Цей список він має. Він обіцяв менідопомогти. Будемо дивитися на результат», — зазначив Глава держави.</p>
<p>На думку Володимира Зеленського, у питанні звільнення з полону цивільнихукраїнців мають проявляти вплив ті, від кого щось залежить у Росії.</p>
<p>«Сьогодні був представник Ватикану від Папи, я його просив, щоб він займавсясаме дітьми, допомагав у поверненні наших дітей. Цю тематику я такожпроговорював із Китаєм. Якщо в них є якісь окремі потужні економічні відносиниз РФ, або релігійні, або політичні відносини — такі люди можуть впливати наповернення дітей і цивільних», — сказав Президент.</p>
<p>The head of state stressed that all humanitarian issues can be resolved when Russia is weaker.</p>
<p>“And she gets weaker every day, and we see it. They are already incapable of praising - we are talking about the de -occupation of our territories today. With each day, it will have an impact on both Putin's strength and his environment, on the strength of the average state. All this will have a great influence, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy summarized.</p>

This is both Iris-T and NASAMS, it is all the basis of air defense that should replace the old Soviet weapons. Therefore, such as 50 batteries should not frighten anyone. Yes, it's expensive, but it is a non -existent. We will gradually strengthen our Air Force, Land Forces and so on. Well, we are waiting, of course, good news about the F-16-this plane is very needed.</p>

<li>Again the attack by aviation, again from the direction of Caspian. And he used the enemy Tirakets, which he could still afford-X-101/555. The vast majority of all was directed in the direction of Kyiv and Central Ukraine. This indicates that the enemy will continue such attacks. Marine rocket launchers were not involved before the attack itself were re -brought to the base points, which may indicate that the occupiers now do not have the potential of the "caliber" that they could apply. But it is too early to relax, we need to be aware that they will continue to terrorize us, in particular, and the rear regions.</li>

Volodymyr Zelensky stated about Zeper President of Ukraine during the communication of the media on the occasion of the journalist Day.</p>
<p>According to the Head of State, during his recent visit to Moldova, the European political community summit was very important with the leaders of the countries, which confirmed his readiness to give Ukraine aircraft-16. The joint approval of the United States of America is still needed.</p>
<p>“Partners know how many aircraft we need. I have already received from some of our European partners understanding about the number - it is powerful. I am very happy information that I received from some states. I just had such a grandfather. It was a serious, powerful proposal, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The president is that the fighter coalition is recorded separately. This can happen at a regular meeting of the Ramstein Defense Group or on another platform.</p>
<p>“And then the preparation of the whole infrastructure will begin. It's not fast. EVERYONE, WHAT TO DO. Commander(Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - Ed.)Mykola Oleshchuk understands where to do what to do, what quantities, ”the Glavs said.</p>
<p>Responding to the question of the importance of the long -term defense of Bakhmut Nadonechyna, Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that about 20,000 "Wagnerians" were reduced on this section of the front, about 60,000 were injured.</p>
<p>According to the President, Ukrainian defenders in this direction received the full weapons that Ukraine had.</p>
<p>"I think it was the most powerful protection that could only be planned. Therefore, everyone realized that Bakhmut would keep a large number of military. For the people who were in Bakhmut, these are super -human. And everything that came to us, the pursuits, shells, etc., we gave everything there: "Storm of the Sedo", artillery of 155-dollar, "Escalibura", "Caesari", "Himars",-the head of state emphasized.</p>
<p>According to Volodymyr Zelensky, it is impossible to "strengthen" buildings in the city, when 50 thousand shells of 122 and 152 caliber arrives on the day.</p>
<p>Відповідаючи на запитання про майбутнє тих українських захисників, які врезультаті поранень більше не можуть перебувати на фронті, він зазначив, щодля таких військових необхідно знаходити роботу в тилу, у штабах тощо й даватизмогу продовжувати службу.</p>
<p>Володимир Зеленський наголосив, що під час спілкування з пораненимивійськовими неодноразово чув від них про бажання повернутися на службу й матироботу.</p>
<p>«Їхня робота — служити державі. Якщо він зараз не може стріляти, він повиненмати іншу роботу», — переконаний Президент.</p>
<p>Глава держави зазначив, що вже обговорював із військовим командуванням питаннязахисників, які проходять тривале лікування після поранень, виводяться за штаті отримують невисоку платню.</p>
<p>«У командирів є вакансії, є вакансії в армії. Треба повертати цих людей,знаходити їм місце, ту чи іншу роботу. Авжеж, людина, наш герой, який не маєкінцівки, втратив її заради держави… Держава повинна дати йому відповіднуроботу, яку ця людина може виконувати. Ця людина буде заробляти відповіднігроші. Мені здається, що це важливо», — підсумував Володимир Зеленський.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-06T98-00-00-04-00/2334.png" /><strong> _ Dear Ukrainians and Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>This day, which began with an urgent meeting of the NSDC, continued with the meeting. We are waiting for a meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Created by Russian terrorists of a catastrophe on Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still release all our land. And every Russian thermal increases only the amount of reparations that Russia will pay for the crimes committed, not the chances of the occupiers to stay on our land.</p>
<p>First, I am grateful to all our rescuers, military, representatives of local communities, every region of our region, who now help people from our southern areas flooded as a result of the Russian terrorist attack.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authorities at all levels do everything to save people and provide with a questioning water of those who received it from the Kakhovka reservoir. Kryvyi Rih and all Dnipropetrovsk, cities and villages of Kherson region, Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhzhia - at least difficult, we have to help people.</p>
<p>Third: I am grateful to everyone who now conducts and helps with the evacuation of people, the size and villages that flooded with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. It is very important now - to help each other and to help the maximum.</p>
<p>The fourth: the whole world will know about this Russian crime of war, the crime of ecocid. This is consciously destroyed by the Russian invaders of the dam and other structures of the hydroelectric power station of the Cecological bomb of mass destruction. For the sake of its own security, the world should now indicate that Russia will not come from the hands of such terror. And I am grateful to all the leaders of the states, all peoples and international organizations that supported Ukraine to help our people, our de -occupying steps. The Prosecutor General appealed to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office to attract international justice to investigation of the dam.</p>
<p>He spoke today with the director of IAEA Grossi, in particular what happened to the Zakhovsky reservoir, the general situation with the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power station. He closed the IAEA director directly and unambiguously to condemn today's Russian thermal and to maximize our efforts to release. His visit to Ukraine agreed.</p>
<p>Fifth: only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from the Russian occupants will be guaranteed that there will be no longer such terrorist attacks. Russia uses everything for terror everywhere-any objects. The terrorist state must lose.The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critical, in particular, to provide water to Crimea, indicates that Russian -owners have already realized that they would have to escape from Crimea.</p>
<p>Well, Ukraine will return all its. And will make Russia pay for the committed.</p>
<p>Glory to all our people who fight and work for the sake of our country and our Narode!</p>
<p>Separately, like yesterday, I want to mention today our heroes at the Bakhmut Napryamka ... Well done, warriors!3rd Separate Storm Brigade and 57 Separate Positent Brigade-Thank you!Thank you for moving forward!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>

And in response to this terror, the immediate and maximum reaction of the world.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUD5rtRmG6U">appeal</a>Regarding Russian eco -cilantras, Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plants, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p><em>Video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua">Presidential Office</a></em></p>
<p>I turn to everyone in the world who appreciates life. Today, on our Ukrainian land, Russian invaders committed the greatest crime of ecocid, and not only during the war, but in ten years.</p>
<p>The Kakhovka reservoir is actually destroyed - one of the largest in Ukraine. 18 million cubic meters of water.</p>
<p>All structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, its dam were on the occupying territory under the full control of Russian invaders.</p>
<p>Last autumn, we had information about the mines of the Dambikakhovsky hydroelectric power station. They did it specifically. First, for blackmail of the world. Secondly, to blow the dam and use the flood as weapons. Actually it happened.</p>
<p>There are more than 100,000 people in the flood area in the flood area. At least tens of thousands of people are now tamped.</p>
<p>The Kakhovka reservoir provided drinking water with a colossal part of Ukraine - a city and a village with hundreds of thousands of people. The plus provided the farmers with TAAGRARE production of the south and the center of Ukraine. Plus, the destruction of the Dam of the January is a man -made blow to the environment, after which nature will have to recover for decades.</p>
<p>The evacuation of people from the flood zone is ongoing - almost 80 settlements with subsoil. A stain of petroleum products was formed - at least 150 tons, which will flow into the Black Sea. We cannot still predict how much chemicals, fertilizers and petroleum products stored in the flooded areas will get into the rivers and the sea.</p>
<p>There are some things obvious today. The first thing is that such an ecocid crime could not be shot simply as a result of shelling of the dam. In order to destroy it, it was a conscious to act in Russian - to change, to undermine, to destroy. Secondly, no) should be left alone against such terror, and I am grateful to anyone who helps Ukraine!Conscious destruction by terrorists of the Dam of the Hydroelectric Commission - from all views in the world looks like one. For Africa, for Europe, and for the United States, and for China, Australia, and India, man -made disasters are evil.</p>
<p>We need to stop Russian evil. All other terrorists in the world have to see that terror is punishable by the world.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you!Thank you all who help us protect life!</strong></p>

<p>Such a statement was made at the UN Security Council meeting by the US Deputy Permanent Representative for this organization Robert Wood, reports his own correspondent.</p>
<p>“Intentional attacks on civilian objects are prohibited by the right of war. Russia as a part -time protocol and the Geneva Conventions has undertaken to attack the structures or installations that hold back "dangerous power, including dams", if such an attack can cause the release of dangerous forces, as well as significant losses among civilian populations, "the US representative recalled.</p>
<p>A statement of the American diplomat came against the backdrop(http://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3719269-bilij-dim-pro-pidriv-kahovskoi-ges-mi-pracuemo-z-ukraincami-abi-zibrati-bilse-informacii.html) проте, що у Вашингтоні наразі не можуть дати остаточних оцінок того, що сталосяна Каховській ГЕС.</p>

<p>Водночас Вуд наголосив: Росія розпочала цю війну, саме вона окупувала частинутериторії України, і саме російські війська незаконно захопили греблю минулогороку й відтоді утримували її. Дипломат констатував, що міжнародна спільнотавкотре стала свідком руйнувань, людських жертв та катастрофічної шкоди длякритично важливої інфраструктури України, спричинених незаконною війною РФ.</p>
<p>Вуд нагадав, що руйнування дамби підриває стабільність енергопостачанняУкраїни та може створити додаткові проблеми для підтримки безпеки Запорізькоїатомної електростанції. У цьому зв’язку він укотре закликав російськуокупаційну владу передати контроль над ЗАЕС українській стороні.</p>
<p>Крім того, дипломат запевнив, що Сполучені Штати тісно співпрацюють зукраїнською владою, аби забезпечити допомогу громадянам, які стали вимушенимипереселенцями внаслідок підриву Каховської <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ges"> ГЕС</a>.</p>
