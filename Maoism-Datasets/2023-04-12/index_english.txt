He noted that the process would consist of several differenties.
According to him, Denmark has specialized drones - submarines that have sessers that are able to detect, record and transmit coordinates to the sappers, which can carry out sapper work underwater. In Ukraine, since 2014, the company has been operating, which is represented by the Kingdom of Denmark. This company has great possible expertise to carry out humanitarian demining, that is, the change in areas that are not in the war zone.
Another institution of demining in Ukraine is the SES. They are interested in the demining of civilian infrastructure.
There is currently an interagency group headed by Yulia Sviridenko, the First Viceremian and the Minister of Economy. It, as an economist, understands which industries are epiorities in this matter. And the experience of the Kingdom of Denmark will be indispensable for the effective work of our sappers.

He was a resident of Zhytomyr region, who was contacting the clients and offering them "conditions" for evacuation. In the investigation, two other Ukrainian citizens, organizers of the criminal group, are currently in one of the EU countries.

 Center for Combating Misinformation in NSDC Ukraine Publicated The main narrative that was promoted by the Russian media.
“Russia is on the side of light. And this can be easily proved, because Russia does not seek to be richer, does not seek to capture other countries, does not seek to subdue someone, ”Kirill Gundyaev said boldly.
Gundyayev's cynical statement was supplemented by the words that the war in Ukraine was the "cemetery of God" and only Russia found the strength to withstand evil.
Also, according to Moscow Pop, the reason for the war in Ukraine was the non -imperial desires of Putin, and the conflict of the West and Russia against the background of the absence of "common Christian values".
The statements of religious leaders are aimed at heating the internal conflict in Ukraine against the background of the transition to the PCU.
"Reconciling the war with religion, the Kremlin tries to justify their crimes and unite the Russians around the" Holy War ", which, in their opinion, should contribute to voluntary mobilization," the statement said.

For several weeks in a row, the situation on the battlefield does not change. The epicenter of combatants is the East. The offensive lasts in four directions at the same time, the Armed Forces with all the enemy, but Bakhmut took the main blow.
About it told Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.
“It was there that the enemy concentrated the greatest effort. So, we have to use a lot of effort for the defense, ”she said.
According to her, the enemy usually loses to us in street battles, so Russians simply destroy all buildings and structures. But our courageous warriors and a professional command team are restraining the enemy in Bakhmut from the promotion of the territory.
“If we did not defend Bakhmut all this time, the enemy would have advanced deep into Ukraine, so the importance of the city's defense should be understood in such a context.
The Russian Federation concentrated the Private Army of the Wagner. For the most part, they are already destroyed by the enemy forced to pull their landing units of Ispecis, ”Anna Malyar explained.

_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.
They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.
There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.
The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.
SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.
We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.
Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.
We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.
As before, our positions at the front, all our warriors in positions are supported by Ukrainian positions politically and informally, forces and power and the power of our social unity, our inner stability of Ukraine's tamitivity with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state, so Ivsih in the state, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value the free life of an international order based on the rules.
It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Thank you to all our partners in the world who does not keep the activity in help.
I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.
_ Glory to all our soldiers!_ 
_ Glory to our strong people!_ 
Glory to Ukraine!

 If the world community does not defeat Russia in its invaders against Ukraine, it will receive a new world war with the Russian fourthwhile.
On this emphasizes Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Alexei Danilov.
He noted that the relations of the Western countries with the Kremlin are similar to the relations of the Third Reich Adolf Hitler.
“The formula of victory of Ukraine and democracy can be discussed, but the formula is defeated. History teaches: no complete and unconditional surrender of the aggressor. Invite Hitler to the Uonna Rada meeting. Legitimize fascist power and recover Business Asusual with Wehrmacht suppliers. Leave the brackets destroyed cities, genocide, terror, torture, thousands of killed, including hundreds of innocent children, destroyed fates ... And continue to press Putin's hand on various samites, meetings and negotiations. If the world chooses a shameful peace, a new war with the Russian Fourth Reich will be wine, ”the NSDC Secretary emphasized.

 Ukrainian doctors have reached such a level of professionalism in the course of the war that 82% of the wounded return to the system.
Many doctors do surgery that has no analogues not only in Ukraine but the world. Due to scientific and practical developments, devices and equipment are able to seize the surgeon's access to the site of injury and to accelerate the operation of surgery. Thus, Vitaliy Tsymbalyuk told an example of a developed magnetic platform for removal of fragments of carts, mines, grenades. The large-scale invasion of Russians by scientific and medical institutions and the institutions of the Ukrainian Sciences of Ukraine, thanks to innovative approaches, managed to rescue 72 of our warriors with a heart wound, 524 military personnel have been saved and resumed by vision, more than 100-hearing after heavy vacuum was restored.
 
The experience of physicians was summarized and outlined in 12 volumes of specialized literature. Unfortunately, according to Academician Tsymbalyuk, "medical experience is written by the blood of our soldiers."

 he was a person we didn't have time to fully appreciate. 
In the morning, the sky above Kharkov is crying ... Maybe the city molds a hero who turns home to rest in an eternal sleep in his native Slobozhansky land?
… Today Kharkiv said goodbye to the famous Ukrainian artist, sculptor Tamusist Anton Derbilov. The artist died on April 6 during the battle of Zakremen, in Luhansk region.
The man was only 43 ... He was a son, a man, a father ...
According to friends, with his wife Catherine, they were familiar with their teenage age. About such couples say - "Such love happens once a million!"
The couple were artists. At one time, Derbilov founded the Sirko Toys studio. They raised thousands of unique models of tin soldiers. In their collection, the Cossacks from the army of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, soldiers for toy -made arms - from the era of antiquity to the twentieth century. Anton also created brasigetmans and generals of Ukraine and other countries.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/1-45-150x150.jpg) 
 -Before creating another sculpture, Anton studied military history. For example, when Finnish journalists made a plot with him, he said for a long time that the Russians had borrowed from their countrymen-maskhalates for snipers, hat-hats, etc. He then very impressed our foreign colleagues with his knowledge,-says Ivanna Skiba-Yakubov ...
In 2015, the man became a member of Alcohol Ukulele music band. His colleague of the band Yurer Yakubov tells that Anton joined the music collective: recently I found his first message, which he wrote to me with a assistant network: "Good afternoon!We live with you in one area!I wanted to ask how to learn to play? From that day, he became a full member of our team. Was Bariton Ukulele. The most important tools on which he played as percussion is a tsesalic chain and a wrench.
For over 20 years, Derbilov's marriage has given birth and raised three daughters - Anna, Oksana and Sofia. All the girls imitated their parents' talent - they have mastered the artistic business.
 
Since the beginning of the fighting in the Donbass, the artist was actively engaged in volunteering. The Ukrainian unicorn was dressed on February 26, 2022 - on the third day of the co -coma -scale offensive of Russians on the territory of Ukraine. The family then said that it was not possible to protect their girls who refused to leave Kharkiv the most difficult minutes ...
Once Anton received a weapon, together with his brothers as part of the Fifth Slobozhansky Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, went to carry out the combat mission of the image of the northern outskirts of Kharkiv.
 - I was a part of the group of "hubs for tanks", - said the warrior. - He was led to Kharkiv Ring, to the direction of a probable enemy breakthrough. Our main purpose was to stop enemy armored vehicles. They went there for days, and they stayed for about a hundred - they got married, created a strong fortress.
The artist shared that everything he worked all his life - to draw, to play dandy tools, to mold, etc. - temporarily had to be left in the past. On February 26, 2022, a new life with new priorities began - had to be papied small arms, grenade launcher, and explosive. Anton reported that he could only perceive himself in a new image of a serviceman when he released the Cossack mustache.
The soldier of Derbilov Anton was a veteran of Slobozhansky counter -offensive. It was medals "for bravery in battle", "The indomitable heroes of the Russo-Ukrainian War" and for the "valiant service".
On April 6, this year, as a result of mortar shelling, Anton Derbilov was disconnected with life and died on a battlefield with weapons in his hands.
