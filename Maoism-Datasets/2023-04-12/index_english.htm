<p>According to him, Denmark has specialized drones - submarines that have sessers that are able to detect, record and transmit coordinates to the sappers, which can carry out sapper work underwater. In Ukraine, since 2014, the company has been operating, which is represented by the Kingdom of Denmark. This company has great possible expertise to carry out humanitarian demining, that is, the change in areas that are not in the war zone.</p>
<p>Another institution of demining in Ukraine is the SES. They are interested in the demining of civilian infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SES is a leader in demining, but they do prompt mine. But this is an operational mine. And the full -scale alteration of the same agrarian sector, when our farmers begging: "Might the pole so that we can sow and grow food" is a huge task, "the minister said.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is currently an interagency group headed by Yulia Sviridenko, the First Viceremian and the Minister of Economy. It, as an economist, understands which industries are epiorities in this matter. And the experience of the Kingdom of Denmark will be indispensable for the effective work of our sappers.</p>
<ul>
<li>In our plans to create our own potential of at least 5 thousand Ukrainian persons who will be demining. And this is the calculation that the experts from other countries will also be involved, - said Alexei Reznikov.- In Croatia, the war ended 28 years ago. By this time, Croatia's territory is not fully unchanged. That is, the Croatian National Center still has a job. They can on average up to 50 square kilometers of land, including rough terrain - rocks, forest huts, etc. - summed up Rennikov.</li>

<p>“Russia is on the side of light. And this can be easily proved, because Russia does not seek to be richer, does not seek to capture other countries, does not seek to subdue someone, ”Kirill Gundyaev said boldly.</p>
<p>Gundyayev's cynical statement was supplemented by the words that the war in Ukraine was the "cemetery of God" and only Russia found the strength to withstand evil.</p>
<p>Also, according to Moscow Pop, the reason for the war in Ukraine was the non -imperial desires of Putin, and the conflict of the West and Russia against the background of the absence of "common Christian values".</p>
<p>The statements of religious leaders are aimed at heating the internal conflict in Ukraine against the background of the transition to the PCU.</p>
<p>"Reconciling the war with religion, the Kremlin tries to justify their crimes and unite the Russians around the" Holy War ", which, in their opinion, should contribute to voluntary mobilization," the statement said.</p>

<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>He held a regular rate meeting today. First of all, they considered the combat. What is in the main directions, in severe directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and Luhansk in general.</p>
<p>They also considered the fact that only should be done. What we work on.</p>
<p>There were reports of General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky, Main Committee, Gur.</p>
<p>The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the completion of new units of our defense forces - new brigades.</p>
<p>SBU head, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on our inner stability, protection against the internal enemy and protidius to collaborators.</p>
<p>We are now at this stage of war, when it is important to our society and the partner to lose the sense of the path we have to go. It is the way. The path that is ahead.</p>
<p>Compared to last year, many places are now quieter. But this does not mean that you can ignore the war somewhere or be less concentrated on the assistance.</p>
<p>We managed to do a lot with partners to protect people, Ukraine, all of Europe. But that does not mean that it is time to rest on the laurels. The path is ahead. Movement is ahead. What we need no less unity, less. No less focus than before.</p>
<p>As before, our positions at the front, all our warriors in positions are supported by Ukrainian positions politically and informally, forces and power and the power of our social unity, our inner stability of Ukraine's tamitivity with the world. And this is what is the task of both the state, so Ivsih in the state, both Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value the free life of an international order based on the rules.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to simply hopefully hoping that someone else who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assault, will bring victory. This is a common task. It is won by everyone. Those who fight for it and those who give weapons. Those who are the possibilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine.Thank you to all our partners in the world who does not keep the activity in help.</p>
<p>I thank all Ukrainians and Ukrainians who understand that we have to go this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state.</p>
<p><strong> _ Glory to all our soldiers!_ </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ Glory to our strong people!_ </strong></p>

<p>There will be no ruins in Ukraine. This is our goal. And it will be quite a specific dioxide of the full loss of the terrorist state.</p>
<p>Moreover, the world knows the solutions - about the assets of Russia, Russian officials, oligarchs who were rich, while their state became a terrorist ... All these are activated to compensate for losses to those whom Russia brought pain and suffering. after aggression. The war should be the most expensive for the aggressor. And we do everything for that. Thank the partners who support us.</p>

<p>I thank the police Gennady Yudin from Avdiivka for the salvation of children, Paramedic Popi, one of the White Angels in the Mariinsky Front. They have already rescued hundreds of our people, including seriously wounded.</p>
<p>I also thank today especially the explosion of the National Police Vladimir Perepelytsya, who works for mine in Kherson region, works very effectively.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it writes <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-nato-sweden-bid-accession-block-democracy-viktor-orban/"></a>.</p>
<p>Parliament <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ugorsina"></a>does not support the application, as Stockholm has previously criticized the situation with democracy in the country. In the backstage, officials and experts say that, in addition to internal political settlements, this position of Budapest is connected with his links with Ankara Tamoskva.</p>
<p>The publication notes that Western allies perceive Hungary Prime Minister Orban much less seriously than Turkish President Recep Taipaerdogan. In addition, it is difficult for allies to understand the rhetoric of Hungary, which is constantly changing.</p>
<p>There is a "zero understanding" of Budapest's position on Sweden's membership in NATO, said a high -ranking European diplomat, who spoke on the conditions of Annoym.</p>
<p>At the same time, the newspaper notes, while many NATO members consider the Outsider in NATO, Hungary sees an ally and an example for a consequence.</p>
<p>"I think Orban believes deeply in the decline of the West. Since Hungary has been fulfilled for the Eastern and southern undemocratic countries, the relations of the gut are extremely important," said Peter Kreko, Director Budapetsti Institute of Political Capital.</p>
<p>As it was reported, the office of the Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban stated that two-way relations between Hungary and Sweden are low.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the National Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexei Danilov said this on the broadcasting of the Unified News.</p>
<p>“I wanted to note that now people who are believers, Holy Week, and this week I would not advise anyone to take any aggressive actions in relation to the state, in relation to other citizens, and to refrain from any activa precise behavior. The state will treat all religions, institutions, which are officially registered in our country, the same. We will not have someone we love or do not love. This is not the state of the state. Anyone can choose a church where he can walk, but what relates to registration documents - all institutions, and does not matter - these are church or some others that are related to Moscow, have some connections with them - they cannot work in the territory of our countries. Moreover, they will not work here, ”Danilov emphasized.</p>

<p>He said that "it does not apply to believers who believe in God who pray, it has no attitude to them."</p>
<p>“And those people who are related to Moscow and have joint documentation or in joint institutions are directly related. They have to stop these joint contacts, in accordance with the regulatory documents, the statutory documents that are in the institutions, and then there will be no issues. But by this time they do not want to do it. We will see how all will be. I emphasize once again - the state will calmly fulfill the functions of the state, the laws of our country in the territory of our country will be binding for all citizens of our country, ”the NSDC secretary emphasized.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent, this was stated in the UN -representative of Ukraine.</p>
<p>"Against the backdrop of an outrageous crime, the presidency of the Russian Federation in the Security Council looks extremely cynical and harms the authority and capabilities of this organ," - said in a widespread statement.</p>
<p>Diplomats stressed that "a state recognized as an aggressor by the General Assembly, a state that continues to commit aggression, war crimes and humanity crimes should not be headed by the UN body, endowed with a key responsibility for supporting international peace and security." “We rely on a solid and decisive position of members <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon"></a>The notion of Russian military crimes and the notion of "peace -loving state" in the sense of 4 Articles of the UN Charter, ”said the UN -UN Mission at the UN.</p>
<p>The statement states that "Russia consciously implements its policy of torture, physical violence, inhuman treatment, intentional causes of gravity, grievous bodily harm and intentional murder of captives and civilians and civilians in Ukraine." "This shocking incident has left our determination to hold all the horrific crimes involved in Ukraine, including the highest leadership of the Russian Tabeszzzzzzzzzzz -in perpetrators," the diplomats summed up.</p>

<p>According to CNN, the first video was posted on the pro -Russian channel of Uzozos networks on April 8. It was deliberately removed by the "Wagner" and shows the two -headed bodies of the Ukrainian military, which lie on the ground near the injured military car. The Russian accounts claim that the video was filmed near Bakhmut.</p>
<p>The second video that appeared on Twitter and deliberately blurred is probably recorded in the summer, given the vegetation in the frame. On it, a Russian boy with a knife is beheaded by the Ukrainian military, who, judging by the voice of Naidideo, was probably alive at the beginning of the massacre.Law enforcement agencies of Ukraine take measures to identify the persons who committed the crime.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure to complete our first training fee for more than six months. I was pleased with the match with Estonia, because the girls used all the shadowing that we trained during the last week.</p>
<p>We made almost nothing to make rivals, quickly played in selections, well -groomed, and had many moments to take the gate. But the team has to improve their decision -making skills when the attacks are completed. In such pens, we have to score more than one ball. One and only simple mistake of the orhorosh action of rivals can negate all our efforts. And in official mats it is unacceptable and can be too expensive, ”the coach said.</p>

<p>According to him, in order to improve the search, withdrawal and management of Russian assets in the territory of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada should approve a number of important changes.

<p>According to Ukrinform, the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office reported in <a href="http://t.me/kyiv_pro_office/1878"></a>.</p>
<p>"Under the procedural leadership of the Podilsky District Prosecutor's Office of the city of Kyiv, it was reported about suspicion of a citizen of the RB-the director of the resident enterprise of the RB of the RB with a wicked evasion of taxes, which led to the actual non-receipt of the budget of funds in particularly large amounts(Part 3 of Art. 212, Part 1 of Art. 366 Criminal Code of Ukraine)", - the message reads.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there is a Belarusian enterprise in Ukraine, which provides services in the field of production <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nafta"></a>and natural gas. Its ultimate owner is an open joint -stock company owned by the Belarusian State Committee on Property. In addition, in its activity, the company uses equipment of the Republican unitary enterprise "Belorussian".</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that during 2017-2020, the suspect-controlled community transferred more than 400 million hryvnias of equipment to the bills of "Belorussian".</p>
<p>"In knowing that these funds should be subject to 15% of the tax rate of foreign legal entities, the director of the enterprise noted the wafish documents of deliberately false information about the amounts of taxes that are maintained in the payment of income to non -residents," the prosecutor's office said.</p>
<p>It is established that more than 60 million hryvnias in the form of taxes on income of foreign legal entities were not reached to the State Budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The issue of election of a suspected preventive measure in the appearance of an isostava, which will be equal to the damage caused, is resolved.</p>
<p>The real estate and movable property of the enterprise, as well as on the corporate right amount of about 4 billion hryvnias, the court was arrested. Prosecutorials have been transferred to the transfer of the specified property and corporate rights in the management of the Agency of Ukraine for the detection, search and management of assets obtained from corruption and other crimes(Arma).</p>

<p>She noted that nuclear power provides the Russian Federation with almost 9 billion dollars each year. In addition, Russia uses Rosatom to supply technologies.</p>
<p>“Since the structure of Rosatom has more than 300 different legal entities that are known in different jurisdictions, it allows Rosatom to use these to buy technologies that then use the UECRACE of the MIC.

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/world/americas/brazil-ukraine-weapons.html"></a>.</p>
<p>When Brazil was preparing for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympic Gigrants, she purchased 34 anti -aircraft guns in Germany for a protected sky.</p>
<p>Last year, German officials turned to the government <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-brazilia"></a>with a request to transfer unused ammunition, which was previously Germanyahada Brazil. However, the response of the leadership of the Latin American country was one: no if weapons go to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Brazil called for peace and in carefully formulated statements criticized Russia's invasion of Russia. But the country that relied on Moscow, fertilizers and fuel, also made it clear that it would not send any arms to the front line, and instead insists on mediation in peaceful changes.</p>
<p>“I don't want to go to war. I want to finish the war, ”said Luis Inasiu Lula da Silva this year.</p>
<p>According to the documents obtained by The New York Times, Ukraine has at least two requests for the purchase of a long list of weapons, which has opened armored vehicles, planes, air defense systems, mortars, seven rifles, automatic weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>Brazil mostly ignored the requests.</p>
<p>Brazil, in particular, is a manufacturer of military aircraft, many of which have been made by the Embraer. Brazil says that its governing principle policy has long been the principle of remaining a "friend for all".</p>

<p>According to the Ukrinform correspondent, this was stated in the UN -representative of Ukraine.</p>
<p>"Against the backdrop of an outrageous crime, the presidency of the Russian Federation in the Security Council looks extremely cynical and harms the authority and capabilities of this organ," - said in a widespread statement.</p>
<p>Diplomats stressed that "a state recognized as an aggressor by the General Assembly, a state that continues to commit aggression, war crimes and humanity crimes should not be headed by the UN body, endowed with a key responsibility for supporting international peace and security." “We rely on a solid and decisive position of members <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon"></a>The notion of Russian military crimes and the notion of "peace -loving state" in the sense of 4 Articles of the UN Charter, ”said the UN -UN Mission at the UN.</p>
<p>The statement states that "Russia consciously implements its policy of torture, physical violence, inhuman treatment, intentional causes of gravity, grievous bodily harm and intentional murder of captives and civilians and civilians in Ukraine." "This shocking incident has left our determination to hold all the horrific crimes involved in Ukraine, including the highest leadership of the Russian Tabeszzzzzzzzzzz -in perpetrators," the diplomats summed up.</p>

<p>According to CNN, the first video was posted on the pro -Russian channel of Uzozos networks on April 8. It was deliberately removed by the "Wagner" and shows the two -headed bodies of the Ukrainian military, which lie on the ground near the injured military car. The Russian accounts claim that the video was filmed near Bakhmut.</p>
<p>The second video that appeared on Twitter and deliberately blurred is probably recorded in the summer, given the vegetation in the frame. On it, a Russian boy with a knife is beheaded by the Ukrainian military, who, judging by the voice of Naidideo, was probably alive at the beginning of the massacre.Law enforcement agencies of Ukraine take measures to identify the persons who committed the crime.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the National Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexei Danilov said this on the broadcasting of the Unified News.</p>
<p>“I wanted to note that now people who are believers, Holy Week, and this week I would not advise anyone to take any aggressive actions in relation to the state, in relation to other citizens, and to refrain from any activa precise behavior. The state will treat all religions, institutions, which are officially registered in our country, the same. We will not have someone we love or do not love. This is not the state of the state. Anyone can choose a church where he can walk, but what relates to registration documents - all institutions, and does not matter - these are church or some others that are related to Moscow, have some connections with them - they cannot work in the territory of our countries. Moreover, they will not work here, ”Danilov emphasized.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it writes <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-nato-sweden-bid-accession-block-democracy-viktor-orban/"></a>.</p>
<p>Parliament <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ugorsina"></a>does not support the application, as Stockholm has previously criticized the situation with democracy in the country. In the backstage, officials and experts say that, in addition to internal political settlements, this position of Budapest is connected with his links with Ankara Tamoskva.</p>
<p>The publication notes that Western allies perceive Hungary Prime Minister Orban much less seriously than Turkish President Recep Taipaerdogan. In addition, it is difficult for allies to understand the rhetoric of Hungary, which is constantly changing.</p>
<p>There is a "zero understanding" of Budapest's position on Sweden's membership in NATO, said a high -ranking European diplomat, who spoke on the conditions of Annoym.</p>
<p>At the same time, the newspaper notes, while many NATO members consider the Outsider in NATO, Hungary sees an ally and an example for a consequence.</p>
<p>"I think Orban believes deeply in the decline of the West. Since Hungary has been fulfilled for the Eastern and southern undemocratic countries, the relations of the gut are extremely important," said Peter Kreko, Director Budapetsti Institute of Political Capital.</p>
<p>As it was reported, the office of the Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban stated that two-way relations between Hungary and Sweden are low.</p>

<p>It is only by the number of Russian aviation grouping more than five to six times. For technological capabilities, the difference is even more significant. Their policy, for example, Su-34, SU-35, went deep modernization. Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Air Forces Command, reported this in the Etheritelvarane "The One News".</p>
<ul>
<li>Russian planes, knocked down in the first days of the war, were their best sides. They suffered enormous losses, underestimating our strength. Ukrainian pilots did the impossible. However, Ukraine is critically needed by a technique that is capable of protecting the Russians. It is as if you are sitting with a pistol in a trenade against five -runs with machine guns. Theoretically, you have weapons, but to win with such a molte, to put it mildly, it is not easy. Without F-16 and sufficient number of submission, we are not able to get them or drive them away. It should be moved to be declared by the Air Force Commander Aviation Coalition under the slogan "Victory on Earth is forging in the sky" has worked and the decision we were so awaiting the provision of aircraft of class 4+.</li>

<p>On the broadcast of the "One News", a spokesman for the Eastern Group of Troops Sergiycheriev explained that no "know-how" was not repaired by the Russian military leadership. The fact that they achieved certain intermediate tactical successes, in fact, in the Bakhmut direction, occurred solely at the expense of "meat" storms, as they were named Western analysts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The constant round -the -clock use of living force, when after the destruction of one wave, another goes away. This is the only thing that gave the occupiers the opportunity to do something, - said Sergei Cherevaty. - Now they operate mainly with small -tactic groups, but strengthened by a regular army. Wagner's power is not enough. This is simply explained, because Wagner uses the staff warehouse as the main driving force. And they carry tremendous losses. If the racists are unfamiliar with a new source of delivery of personnel, then Wagner will cease to be a powerful combat unit. It is no secret that it is becoming more difficult to dial in prisons, because the "sundress radio" has spread that a visit to Bakhmut is a visit one way.</li>

<p>At the beginning of a large-scale invasion of the FSB, Astakhov formed a different agent group for intelligence and subversive activities against Ukraine. To its composition, the traitor remotely attracted several dozen residents of the southern eastern regions, in particular-from Bakhmut. The main task of hostile agents was the collection of intelligence on the places of basement and movement of defense forces near Fronte. The information obtained by the attackers sent Astakhov through the telegram messenger in the form of locations on electronic maps with a detailed description of the objects.</p>

<ul>
<li>The people who just came to the army, they have not heard, for example, explosions, shots.

If the warriors will hear one on the battlefield, if their commander gives orders correctly, clearly, of course, then it will save the life of every warrior.</li>

<p>“Russian invaders have posted a video of cruel murder again on the network. Humanity and humanity sights, can any army be lighted at all, and then spread this video to the general?

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T84-00-00-04-00/1-43.jpg" />In Kiev, a roundtable on the Military Media Center on the topic: "Innovations of Ukrainian doctors in the rescue and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers."</p>
<p>The topic was attended by: President of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine Vitaliy Tsymbalyuk, Head of Innovation Department of the Ministry of Health Bogomolets Vasyl Parii, Head of the Central Health and Evacuation Department of the Armed Forces Command of the Armed Forces Colonel Inna Bragin Medical Service.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T84-00-00-04-00/2-40.jpg" />Academician Vitaliy Tsymbalyuk, in particular, noted that with the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, since 2014, civilian doctors have joined the rescue. The experience of treating combat injuries was practically no, so they learned. For 9 years, a single medical space has been formed in Ukraine, where united military and civilian medical institutions were united. The experience of Israel was taken as the basis of military-medical dialrine. All medicine of this country is able to be able to be bored in a matter of hours and to ensure the reception and treatment of the wounded invise armed conflict. This is an example for the Ukrainian medical community.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T84-00-00-04-00/3-35.jpg" />Ukrainian doctors have reached such a level of professionalism in the course of the war that 82% of the wounded return to the system.</p>
<p>Many doctors do surgery that has no analogues not only in Ukraine but the world. Due to scientific and practical developments, devices and equipment are able to seize the surgeon's access to the site of injury and to accelerate the operation of surgery. Thus, Vitaliy Tsymbalyuk told an example of a developed magnetic platform for removal of fragments of carts, mines, grenades. The large-scale invasion of Russians by scientific and medical institutions and the institutions of the Ukrainian Sciences of Ukraine, thanks to innovative approaches, managed to rescue 72 of our warriors with a heart wound, 524 military personnel have been saved and resumed by vision, more than 100-hearing after heavy vacuum was restored.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T84-00-00-04-00/4-31.jpg" /></p>
<p>The experience of physicians was summarized and outlined in 12 volumes of specialized literature. Unfortunately, according to Academician Tsymbalyuk, "medical experience is written by the blood of our soldiers."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/golovna-24.jpg" /><strong> he was a person we didn't have time to fully appreciate. </strong></p>
<p>In the morning, the sky above Kharkov is crying ... Maybe the city molds a hero who turns home to rest in an eternal sleep in his native Slobozhansky land?</p>
<p>… Today Kharkiv said goodbye to the famous Ukrainian artist, sculptor Tamusist Anton Derbilov. The artist died on April 6 during the battle of Zakremen, in Luhansk region.</p>
<p>The man was only 43 ... He was a son, a man, a father ...</p>
<p>According to friends, with his wife Catherine, they were familiar with their teenage age. About such couples say - "Such love happens once a million!"</p>
<p>The couple were artists. At one time, Derbilov founded the Sirko Toys studio. They raised thousands of unique models of tin soldiers. In their collection, the Cossacks from the army of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, soldiers for toy -made arms - from the era of antiquity to the twentieth century. Anton also created brasigetmans and generals of Ukraine and other countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-45.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/1-45-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-43.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/2-43-150x150.jpg" /></a>-Before creating another sculpture, Anton studied military history. For example, when Finnish journalists made a plot with him, he said for a long time that the Russians had borrowed from their countrymen-maskhalates for snipers, hat-hats, etc. He then very impressed our foreign colleagues with his knowledge,-says Ivanna Skiba-Yakubov ...</p>
<p>In 2015, the man became a member of Alcohol Ukulele music band. His colleague of the band Yurer Yakubov tells that Anton joined the music collective: recently I found his first message, which he wrote to me with a assistant network: "Good afternoon!We live with you in one area!I wanted to ask how to learn to play? From that day, he became a full member of our team. Was Bariton Ukulele. The most important tools on which he played as percussion is a tsesalic chain and a wrench.</p>
<p>For over 20 years, Derbilov's marriage has given birth and raised three daughters - Anna, Oksana and Sofia. All the girls imitated their parents' talent - they have mastered the artistic business.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/3-37.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Dad was a cheerful, optimistic and open person. We were always sure that he loved us most in this world!And he protected us with his breath!- says the daughter of warrior Sofia Derbilov.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the beginning of the fighting in the Donbass, the artist was actively engaged in volunteering. The Ukrainian unicorn was dressed on February 26, 2022 - on the third day of the co -coma -scale offensive of Russians on the territory of Ukraine. The family then said that it was not possible to protect their girls who refused to leave Kharkiv the most difficult minutes ...</p>
<p>Once Anton received a weapon, together with his brothers as part of the Fifth Slobozhansky Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, went to carry out the combat mission of the image of the northern outskirts of Kharkiv.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-12T92-00-00-04-00/4-33.jpg" />- I was a part of the group of "hubs for tanks", - said the warrior. - He was led to Kharkiv Ring, to the direction of a probable enemy breakthrough. Our main purpose was to stop enemy armored vehicles. They went there for days, and they stayed for about a hundred - they got married, created a strong fortress.</p>
<p>The artist shared that everything he worked all his life - to draw, to play dandy tools, to mold, etc. - temporarily had to be left in the past. On February 26, 2022, a new life with new priorities began - had to be papied small arms, grenade launcher, and explosive. Anton reported that he could only perceive himself in a new image of a serviceman when he released the Cossack mustache.</p>
<p>The soldier of Derbilov Anton was a veteran of Slobozhansky counter -offensive. It was medals "for bravery in battle", "The indomitable heroes of the Russo-Ukrainian War" and for the "valiant service".</p>
<ul>
<li>I always looked at Anton with delight!He was my idol - a talented artist, a wonderful family man, a real Ukrainian warrior who will always come to the rescue, put his shoulder, lift the fighting spirit of his brothers. He has always gone forward, no matter how difficult it was, - says the brothers who died on the pseudo "Lizashur".</li>
</ul>
<p>On April 6, this year, as a result of mortar shelling, Anton Derbilov was disconnected with life and died on a battlefield with weapons in his hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anton was a man of high standards, one of those whom we do not have to appreciate. And now we are all filled with anger because the Russians killy, which could give a lot to Ukraine!I do not like the phrase "dying the best", but unfortunately, the best die ... Unfortunately, the love that it was surrounded is unobtrusive,-shares Ivanna Skiba-Yakubova ...</li>

SES of Major Artem Shuldyakova, Lieutenant Fyodor Zaykina, Senior Sergeant Vasyl Muzychenko, Junior Satistant Vitaliy Bulkin.
