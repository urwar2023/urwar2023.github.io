<p>The retired Lieutenant General, the former US Army Commander in Europe, Bengjes called "political excuses" about delaying supplies for landscape missiles. He stressed that he was proud of what the United States has already done to help the Armed Forces, but I am sure that the government can find ways to expand the types of arms that transmit the Ukrainian army. _ “In fact, I prefer not to talk about a specific type of weapon. Rather - about capabilities; about the ability of Ukraine to make Crimea inaccessible to the Russians; About the opportunity to strike the Posivastopol, on saki, on janka.

<p>The international community should remain firmly committed to the responsibility for the crimes committed in and against Ukraine.</p>

<p>“I do not believe that Ukraine has a future without NATO, and I do not believe that NATO is a capacious without Ukraine. If we want Europe and the North Atlantic to be safe or protected, we should include countries that are confronted with a ration from Russia. We have already said that Russia is a fundamental strategic threat to the North Atlantic Alliance. That is why all countries that are highly threatened should be together, they must be protected together in order to restrain any future aggression, ”Gabrielus Landsbergis stressed.</p>

<p>-Indeed, Bakhmut remains the object of focusing the main efforts of Vorozhaz, among all other areas. For Russia, the East of Ukraine is the only part of the front where it has made at least some progress with the beginning of the "big offensive". The plan to win Ukraine in three days has transformed into nine -month attempts by a small city. After a series of defeats in the north and south of the Ukrainian -ownership, it is necessary to demonstrate at least the slightest success in the occupation of Donbass. Without mastering it, the invaders will not be able to develop the offensive in the direction of Kramatorsk and Siverskaya.

Live Air(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news" was said by a spokesman for the eastern grouping of armed force troops Colonel Sergey Cherevaty.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Bakhmut, the situation is dynamic, it changes from time to time, because a position war is ongoing, - he says. - We do everything as possible to inflict the lesion, maneuvering, we use all the available means of damage. The enemy also concentrates his efforts on Bakhmut - in fact, in our operating room, there is no such powerful fighting anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past day, the enemy has attacked our positions on the Bakhmut Napryamka, 280 times struck various types of artillery, performed 4 Avhalts. Only in Bakhmut area there were 85 shelling and 20 combatants. As a result of the fighting, 175 invaders were destroyed and 213 were injured. The enemy T-72 tank was shot down, four combat drifts, three MSTA-B guns, five unmanned aerial vehicles, a single-electronic wrestling one, as well as four field deposits.</p>
<p>According to Colonel Sergei Cherevatov, for the whole period of defense of Bakhmutu -Ukrainian defenders have already destroyed tens of thousands of Russians.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think, over time, our military analysts will name the exact figures, but the loss is huge here, - says the officer. - As for the criminal group "Wagner", it is no longer able to perform combat tasks on its own, which has been done earlier, actually monopolizing this direction. Although the "Wagnerivtsi" is the main force that attacks, the Russians in the Bakhmut direction, they can no longer act without the help of a regular army. The more ashable units of the troops of the invaders, the units of special purposes are increasingly used, so we understand that the loss of the enemy is very significant as Wagner is probably the final border.</li>

<p>Live broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">TEMACHORFON</a>The only news is the head of the united Press Center of Defense forces of Tavriysky, Colonel Alexei Dmitryashkivsky noted that the enemy began to start his artillery component again.</p>
<ul>
<li>The enemy firets our positions with almost the same intensity as Tsybul in February, - says the officer. - In yesterday and today, the enemy has almost 500 each position from different artillery systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alexei Dmitrashkivsky told about the assault actions, the enemy 22 times healed the positions of our troops. It happened in the Marinka area, which the enemy was not at attempts to capture to block Avdiivka.</p>
<p>Also, the head of the united Press Center of Defense Forces of Tavriyskaya direction was that yesterday the enemy changed his tactics. So, trying to show the advantage in the air, the enemy increased the number of aviation strikes, and moving to the tactics of group air strikes. That is, two aircraft released Ukrainian air defense, and the third struck.</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of weather conditions, the enemy doubled the number of use of unmanned aerial vehicles yesterday. First of all, the vows are said.</p>
<p>-Also yesterday there was a change in the use of the enemy Dronov-Kamikadze,-continues Alexei Dmitrashkivsky. - Yesterday afternoon, they first consided the Shahledi, which were well knocked down, but after the "Shahmed" appeared "lancets". This was also the purpose of identifying our points of antipyretic defense.</p>
<p>The officer also told about the deterioration of the moral and psychological state of the avalanche, and the news in the Tavriya direction. Yes, he noted that in the recent information about the arrival in the area of Avdiivka of the new tanking unit of the occupying army, it has not shown itself at all, and for the attacks of our positions the enemy uses the fourth day in a row exclusively infantry. Oleksiy Dmitrashkivsky may assume, this is due to the fact that the opponent is not so much selected to use this technique as to demonstrate the effect of its precision.</p>
<p>And in the carbon direction, as the head of the united press center told, a broken enemy of the 155th Brigade of Marine Corps appeared again. However, it is unlikely that it could fully restore the combat capability in such compisormins.</p>

<p>The Cabinet of Ministers made a decision to submit proposals for application of sectoral sanctions in the NSDC to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The government approved the relevant to the meeting on April 25.</p>
<p>Pre-proposals were considered and recommended for submission to the Cabinet of Ministers by an interagency working group on the implementation of state sanction policy under the chairmanship of the First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine-Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Sviridenko.</p>
<p>“We start the sectoral sanctions against Iran. The previous restrictions imposed by Ukraine and our partners on persons and companies directly involved in the supply of Russia's weapons were unfortunately not perceived as a serious warning.

It is so unmistakable for the uncommon help of the aggressor, ”Yulia Sviridenko said.</p>
<p>According to government proposals, sanctions are imposed for a term of 50 years there:</p>
<ul>
<li>prevention of withdrawal of capital by residents of the Islamic Republic of Iran outside Ukraine; * prohibition of the transfer to residents of Iran technologies, rights to intellectual property rights; * prohibition of investments in Iran and to/in favor of residents of the country; * Stopping service of electronic payment means(In particular, transfers, payments and cash issuance)Iran's issued residents; * prohibition of registration by the National Bank of Ukraine of the international payment system, a participant of the international payment system, whose operators are residents of the Islamic Republic of Iran, etc.; * Restriction of trade transactions with goods, the international broadcasts of which is subject to the Law of Ukraine “On State Control over International Programs for Military Purpose and Dual Usage” with residents(Complete ban), restriction of trade operations with services related to the supply, sale, transmission, production or use of such goods, complete termination of transit of resources, flights and transportation by the residents of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the territory of Ukraine related to the above operations.<strong> Source: </strong> <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/zaprovadzhuiemo-sanktsii-proty-iranu-dopomoha-ahresoru-ne-zalyshytsia-nepokaranoiu-iuliia-svyrydenko"><em>asor portal</em></a></li>

<p>First of all, I want to thank our whole team, which deals with the exchange.</p>
<p>It was possible to return home to Ukraine 44 people from Russian captivity. Most are the military. From different directions.

<p>Of course, I thank all our soldiers on the forefront, who collects replenishment for the exchange fund. Every Russian prisoner is an opportunity to exchange our man.</p>
<p>In total, 2279 Ukrainians and Ukrainian women were returned from the Russian captivity during the full -scale war.</p>
<p>He spoke with the leader of China today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our native grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications.</p>
<p>Today, however, he participated in the conference in Rome, which is dedicated to the reconstruction of our state. It is such a special format of communication of government officials and representatives of the industrial and business of our countries, Ukraine and Italy. In order to be uniformly involved in Ukraine, those who embody the economic power of thectal.</p>
<p>I thank Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this conference for her words for Ukraine's constant support. It is important that we are already planning our cooperation on the 24th year. In particular, this applies to the future Italian presidency of the UG7, as well as the preparation of the Grand Donor Conference on Recovery.</p>
<p>Spent a separate telephone conversation with George. The key theme was already a defense work, the support of our soldiers. Thank you, Italy!</p>
<p>These days we also carry out special work with partners on the coordination of defense quotes and supply. It is very important for Ukraine that anyone who, together with us, is to protect freedom, clearly understood the prospect of our power, we can. The better we understand each other, the easier it is to work in a common victory. For obvious reasons, the details of such communication do not provide publicly.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>He spoke today with the Director of the Grossi. The Chernobyl catastrophe anniversary is the day that everyone is in the world to remind you. And especially when the threat of a radiation disaster in the Zaporizhzhya nuclear stage has been stored every day and every year.</p>
<p>Only full control of Ukraine over the ZPP can also restore full security, and only our country, but all over Europe, all over the world.</p>
<p>Radiation does not recognize state borders in the same way as the Russian Federation. Or more complete compliance with the rules can guarantee safety.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mr. Grossy on his initiative - a very important social organization - such a special program of medical support for the staff of all nuclear power plants. Thank you for the support of our people!<strong> Glory to all Ukrainian soldiers who are now in battle, at combat posts and assignments!</strong></p>

<p>According to Ukrinform's own correspondent, such a conclusion can be made by the Power of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China MAO Nin on the question of the correspondent of the Russian propaganda edition of the TASS in relation to the relevant statement of the State Secretary of Defense of Defense of the United Kingdom James Gippi.</p>
<p>The Russian propagandist has emphasized the words of Hippi on the sending of Ukraine "thousands of shells for the Challenger 2 tanks, including with depleted muur", as well as "the United Kingdom does not control the use of these ammunition and is not obliged to eliminate the consequences of their use," and, obviously, waiting for condemnation from <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj"></a>.</p>
<p>Responding to the request of commenting on this information, Mao said: “How much she learned, the relevant countries used ammunition with impoverished immuel in the Middle East, Europe and other regions, attracting the attention of the world. As for the "crisis in Ukraine", the relevant countries have to cool and promote diplomatic settlement, not to blow the fire of the hypodal escalation. "</p>

<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9330"></a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>First of all, I want to thank our whole team, which deals with the exchange.</p>
<p>It was possible to return home to Ukraine 44 people from Russian captivity. Most are the military. From different directions. Among them are the defenders of Azovstal and Mariupol, other cities of Donetsk region, Kherson, Kharkiv region ... Most are ordinary and sergeants. There are officers. Two are civil.</p>
<p>And it is important that the team works for all those in captivity ... Even if it is difficult, such as some categories of prisoners, and these are not just a military, who are difficult to return, but also, for example, civilians are one of those categories, one of those categories, which is difficult.</p>
<p>We remember everyone. And even if there is no precise information about what happened to, where it can be, such a person is still searched and checked as much as possible. Ukraine has to recover all its.</p>
<p>I thank all of you, the guys who coordinate this work: Budanov, Yermak, Lubin, Usov, Kid, Klimenko ... Thank you to everyone who helps in Gur I Mo, the Voishei, and in the SBU, and in our other structures.</p>
<p>Of course, I thank all our soldiers on the forefront, who collects replenishment for the exchange fund. Every Russian prisoner is an opportunity to exchange our man.</p>
<p>In total, 2279 Ukrainians and Ukrainian women were returned from the Russian captivity during the full -scale war.</p>
<p>He spoke with the leader of China today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our native grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications.</p>
<p>Today, however, he participated in the conference in Rome, which is dedicated to the reconstruction of our state. It is such a special format of communication of government officials and representatives of the industrial and business of our countries, Ukraine and Italy. In order to be uniformly involved in Ukraine, those who embody the economic power of thectal.</p>
<p>I thank Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this conference for her words for Ukraine's constant support. It is important that we are already planning our cooperation on the 24th year. In particular, this applies to the future Italian presidency of the UG7, as well as the preparation of the Grand Donor Conference on Recovery.</p>
<p>Spent a separate telephone conversation with George. The key theme was already a defense work, the support of our soldiers. Thank you, Italy!</p>
<p>These days we also carry out special work with partners on the coordination of defense quotes and supply. It is very important for Ukraine that anyone who, together with us, is to protect freedom, clearly understood the prospect of our power, we can. The better we understand each other, the easier it is to work in a common victory. For obvious reasons, the details of such communication do not provide publicly.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>He spoke today with the Director of the Grossi. The Chernobyl catastrophe anniversary is the day that everyone is in the world to remind you. And especially when the threat of a radiation disaster in the Zaporizhzhya nuclear stage has been stored every day and every year.</p>
<p>Only full control of Ukraine over the ZPP can also restore full security, and only our country, but all over Europe, all over the world.</p>
<p>Radiation does not recognize state borders in the same way as the Russian Federation. Or more complete compliance with the rules can guarantee safety.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mr. Grossy on his initiative - a very important social organization - such a special program of medical support for the staff of all nuclear power plants. Thank you for the support of our people!<strong> Glory to all Ukrainian soldiers who are now in battle, at combat posts and assignments!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

The collection of information about prisoners was harvested. All photos and videos that are published by analysts are used. They are verified. The enemy deliberately manipulates that people who return from captivity transmitted the data.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/Koord_shtab/903">reports</a>Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The staff representative stressed that only some of our captives were confirmed by the Russian side, but Ukraine is working to return everyone: both those who are considered missing and those whom the Russian Federation did not confirm, but the consciousness of captivity. And it often succeeds.</p>
<p>The relatives are worried about whether their defenders and defenders are submitting to exchange. Alerosia of hundreds of the submitted can only agree to exchange a few. The final decision to whom will be changed is made by the party that holds the prisoners. Ukrainian sales funds to return everyone - regardless of the unit or place of detention.</p>
<p>“The enemy spreads a lot of false data on social networks to then say that Ukraine does nothing to return its people. But if it was true, exchanges would happen after the fighting was completed, as during the previous wars. And we have already managed to return more than two thousand prisoners, ”the headquarters representative said.</p>

In the Crimean process, the key role will be played by young people, so now they need to mobilize their potential and experience. During the Crimea Wave Forum, experts from political, economic, cultural, information and other areas have discussed discussions and dialogues with politically active youth.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-26T57-00-00-04-00/foto-2-17.jpg" />- In the framework of the working group, we considered how state bodies will work in the crimbage. I will say that our vision - people's deputies, representatives of states - such that of course, the military administration must first be created in the Crimea. Then there is a transition to a military-civil administration, then-elections and transition to civilian life. It is very important for us that young people are involved. They should become frames of development that will go to the Crimean peninsula and rebuild our Crimea, - said Tamila Tasheva.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are working on the first steps to be taken after the Crimean Peninsula is released. The first of them is undoubtedly ensuring the safety of citizens who live there. The second is the demilitarization of the Peninsula of the Switches. The third step is to bring the guilty to account. People who committed criminal offenses against our country will be held reference. And those who have illegally arrived at the peninsula have to collapse it, we will be published. The next step is the restoration of the authorities. Also, we must make the Russian media do not prevail. There should be an honest opinion of the Ukrainian authorities, should have accessible media. People should stop living in a vacuum of Russian propaganda, - said Anatoly Stelmach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certainly, the participants of the forum point out that the reintegration of Crimea is a complex process, but this is an extremely important task for Ukraine as a whole. That is why it is necessary to mobilize Ukrainian youth, because their potential, and professionalism will play a key role in this process.</p>

<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-maye-unikalnij-dosvid-zahistu-derzhavi-ta-lyudej-v-82493">said</a>During a speech at the final panel conference on the restoration of Ukraine in Rome:</p>
<p>“Ms. Prime Minister Italy!</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister of Ukraine!</p>
<p>Ms. Vice President of the Confederation of the Italian Industry!</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!Dear present!The road Italie!</p>
<p>Thank you for this conference and sincere interest in Ukraine. I know that the menesluks are representatives and representatives of hundreds of Italian and Ukrainian companies, and I would like to turn to you not just as those who embody the business. And as to dads and moms, to sons and daughters, as to the representatives of your communities, your cities, your country ...</p>
<p>There are completely different people, different families, different generations, but we are in fact one aspirations with you. We all want freedom and normal development for our children, we want safety and well -being for our parents. The desires and lightness of life for their communities and cities. And it unites us.</p>
<p>And this is what I suggest talking about.</p>
<p>About how we can give you more safety to our families together. Most weave our countries. More freedom to Ukrainian and Italian children. More guarantees of normal life for our communities and our cities.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>It is already clear when and what this war should end, which Russia has solved anti -nouns. Against all of us. Against Ukraine and all our common European home, who gave a chance for a peaceful life and prosperity to all European peoples. I have a doubt that we are able to win. Because we not only believe in our own strength, but we stand and protect our common values in unity. In unity!Whoever keeps unity and does not lose strength, he wins.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of Italy now, all your people and communities, your leadership and personally Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this unity. The unity of Europeans who know that beyond our freedom, that is, where all of us in Europe wants to reject Russia, there can be no normal and dangerous life.</p>
<p>We have to do - and we will do!- All that this Russian war ended in Russian. And so, this year we have to do everything to the maximum to prepare the largest economic project of our time in Europe - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine.In this war, the world saw that it was necessary for the real protection of every nation. It has been awarded how to change energy and infrastructure, production of and logistics, cyber systems and educational space, the defense industry of the army.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a demand for new security standards in the world to make every country beyond any manifestations of aggression, terror or element. And we will create such security standards in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I will give you five examples that will show you the practical meaning of what I say.</p>
<p>The first is energy.</p>
<p>Russia has launched a real energyaging against Europe. She provoked the price crisis of impoverishment of millions of families because of the growth of accounts. She tried to produce physical supply of fuel to Europe. She beat rockets and Iranian Drones on our energy so that Ukrainians remain without electricity and heat. Europe stood. We answered this call with dignity. And we must do everything to make the enemy not the theoretical opportunity to break the nurser gun.</p>
<p>The "green" transformation of energy and a kind of decentralization of production is a response. The more manufacturers - "green" energy producers, is a more toxic system. The more sources of supply, the more reliably the city, every community and every family is provided.</p>
<p>Plus Italy is one of the leaders in creating "smart" networks(smart grids).Тому я запрошую ваші компанії разом розвивати українські мережі. І, будьласка, не забувайте, що в найближчій перспективі українські мережі будутьмережами Євросоюзу.</p>
<p>Друге — власне будівництво.</p>
<p>Українці ніколи не здадуть своєї країни ворогу й ніколи не полишать своєїземлі. Хоч сотні наших сіл і десятки міст спалені ударами російської артилеріїта авіації, українці здатні повернути їх до життя. Не у звичці нашого народу —залишати на своїй землі рани, що не загоїлися.</p>
<p>Ми маємо колосальну потребу у відбудові тисяч будинків, сотень шкіл, лікарень,транспортної, виробничої інфраструктури. Причому на новій безпековій основі,яка має стати типовою для інших країн, для міст у тих країнах, де люди вхороші часи можуть і не задумуватися про безпеку. Але розуміють, що гарантіїпотрібні.</p>
<p>Щоб кожен батько був спокійним за свою дитину у школі — бо там є сховище,безпечне місце, яке гарантує захист. Щоб кожна мати знала: у її громаді, у їїмісті безпекова інфраструктура влаштована так, що будь-який терорист — чидержава, як Росія, чи якась терористична організація — точно програє наявнійсистемі безпеки.</p>
<p>The third example is technologies.</p>
<p>Full -scale Russian aggression did not break Ukrainian finances, banking system, digital services that our people are used to.</p>
<p>We have preserved the connection in the country and all that is not to imagine modern life. Babil, we have attracted our Aviters to the cyber defense of the state and the economy. Miporoborons were constructed by the country. We continue to develop an action state service that provides access to public services through a smartphone or portal.</p>
<p>In addition, partners in Europe are already taking our "action" for their digital development.</p>
<p>Our defense industry is gaining momentum even now when the war is brushing. We are interested in the localization in Ukraine of the production of such military equipment we receive from partners. We build new produce of our own weapons and ammunition. We create new protection tools such as floxes as a wide range of drones for our front.</p>
<p>I am sure that your companies have something to add to these stories of Ukrainian success.</p>
<p>The fourth is global markets.</p>
<p>The world has already understood the potential of our country's agrarian sector. Ukrainian is to guarantee global food stability. Supply from Ukraine is food on the tables of millions of families in different countries, including Africa, Asia. Pulge to Ethiopia, from Lebanon to Yemen. Without our supply to some countries, the chaos would be accumulated. And that means - there would be new waves of migration, including Uevrop.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no such considerable potential for green metallurgy in Ukraine in Europe. From iron ore to lithium and other maximum -needed resources - all this is Ukraine. From natural gas to the way ... We can give - and give!- All this global markets. We can largely replace the company with Russia - those who have chosen work for war, not a mentally development.</p>
<p>But the number one task is processing. So, these are new enterprises. So, it is new logistics and modernization of transport. So, these are new investments. Aotge, these are profits. And I am sure that your companies too.</p>
<p>And the fifth example - and this is far from the last of cooperation - pharmaceutical and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>There is a purely economic fact: Ukraine is a huge market and net import pharmaceutical goods. One thing already means that the localization of the production of in Ukraine gives an obvious benefit.To finish the war is, in particular, to quench the pain that was survived in the war, brought from the war, associated with the war. Obviously, we will work over this in Ukraine - and together with the best representatives of the world.</p>

<p>“He spoke to China's leader today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.</p>
<p>It is possible to apply China's political influence to regain power by the principles of the rules on which peace should be kept. Ukraine and China, as well as the absoluteness of the world, are equally interested in the strength of the sovereignty of nations of iterial integrity ... in compliance with the main security rules, including inadmissibility of threats to nuclear weapons and the distribution of nuclear weapons. We are equally interested that the situation around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant is fully protected and that the nuclear power plants are not used for the sake of military purposes at all - namely cynical use of nuclear power plants, Russia is trying to make the norm.</p>
<p>It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our Sea grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications, ”the Head of State said.</p>
