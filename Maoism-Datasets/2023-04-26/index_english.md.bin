I want to remedy about the terrible situation on the spot for all the people who are now calling Domir. I also call for peace. But where were these calls when Russia is pulled on the borders? We need to understand very clearly what is happening. There is an aggressor that violated the UN Statute and invaded another country, and there is a victim of this aggression. We can take such a benevolent approach that states: "Oh, one is bad to stop, and the other does not want. Oh no!" It is impossible to put one level of the aggressor and aggressive, ”said Josep Borrel.

“Russia does not want to stop the invasion, and Ukraine must continue to defend. The all -right way to explain what is happening there.

“By organizing these debates in the Radbeza, Russia tries to show itself as a defender of the UN status and multilaterality. Nothing can be far from truth. Cincinically. We all know that while Russia is destroying, we are building. While they are breaking, we protect. The UN Statute, the UN General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court - wherever you look, Russia is disrespectful, ”the statement reads.

EU ambassadors repeated the demand for Russia to withdraw troops from the territory of Ukraine.

"If Russia cares for effective multilaterality, it is the first way to prove it. Compliance with the rules based on the rules - a term that Russia consciously interprets, means respect for international law and the UN Charter of Recovery of these Rules to be applied to all," - emphasized. .

The international community should remain firmly committed to the responsibility for the crimes committed in and against Ukraine.

“The Ukrainian people have paid the most expensive price, but the harmful consequences of Russian aggression are felt all over the world. In close dialogue with our partners, it was asactivated to overcome the global consequences of the Russian War. We emphasize that all efforts to support Ukraine were made in addition, and the unobstructedness of our global obligations, ”the document said.

On this [emphasized](https://twitter.com/GLandsbergis/status/1650511286180933641)The Glavasic Political Office of Lithuania Gabrielus Landsbergis.

“We are NATO members, Article 5 protects us and guarantees that we will not be amazed. The events in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014, and the current imposition of the Russian Federation in Ukraine really shows that NATO can protect the countries that know this side of the border, ”Gabrielus Landsbergis reminded.

According to him, the same Russian tanks that shot unarmed not guilty of the civilians of Lithuania, who tried to defend the country liberated in 1991, are now killing Ukrainians.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister reminded that in two months in Vilnius [will take place](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/11/09/nastupnyj-samit-nato-vidbudetsya-vlitku-2023-roku-v-lytvi/)The NATO Summit, and the holdings of the capital, which is so close to Russia and Belarus, is a landmark.

“I do not believe that Ukraine has a future without NATO, and I do not believe that NATO is a capacious without Ukraine. If we want Europe and the North Atlantic to be safe or protected, we should include countries that are confronted with a ration from Russia. We have already said that Russia is a fundamental strategic threat to the North Atlantic Alliance. That is why all countries that are highly threatened should be together, they must be protected together in order to restrain any future aggression, ”Gabrielus Landsbergis stressed.

“Having faced with a non-existent dialogue, NATO, as a political and military Alliance, should be ready to adjust its strategy on the go. For seventy -six years, this magazine, George Kennan, called for a policy of restraining the Doradian Union. Similar principles can be applied today, the vicious power, rigid sanctions, the isolation of Russia and the transatlantic unity with the eclipinal principles of our strategy, ”the authors of the article say.

The premieres of these countries emphasize that if Europe wants to remain holistic, American participation and leadership will remain decisive.

“However, the determination in support of Ukraine will also help contain aggression in other parts of the world, sending reports that tyrants do not calm whether LLC in Europe, asia, or anywhere else. This message will become especially clear, if Ukraine will win, and Russia will be defeated, ”the article reads.

-Indeed, Bakhmut remains the object of focusing the main efforts of Vorozhaz, among all other areas. For Russia, the East of Ukraine is the only part of the front where it has made at least some progress with the beginning of the "big offensive". The plan to win Ukraine in three days has transformed into nine -month attempts by a small city. After a series of defeats in the north and south of the Ukrainian -ownership, it is necessary to demonstrate at least the slightest success in the occupation of Donbass. Without mastering it, the invaders will not be able to develop the offensive in the direction of Kramatorsk and Siverskaya. Therefore, Russian propaganda provides battles for Bakhmut as a "battle for Stalingrad". They love such parallels. And in order to reach its goals, Russia will not regret human or material resources,-said Colonel-General Alexander Sirsky.

![](ConvertedIMGs/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-25T69-00-00-04-00/sergij-cherevatyj.png)The enemy continues to concentrate his efforts on trying to capture Bakhmut. Live Air(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news" was said by a spokesman for the eastern grouping of armed force troops Colonel Sergey Cherevaty.

- In Bakhmut, the situation is dynamic, it changes from time to time, because a position war is ongoing, - he says. - We do everything as possible to inflict the lesion, maneuvering, we use all the available means of damage. The enemy also concentrates his efforts on Bakhmut - in fact, in our operating room, there is no such powerful fighting anywhere else.

Over the past day, the enemy has attacked our positions on the Bakhmut Napryamka, 280 times struck various types of artillery, performed 4 Avhalts. Only in Bakhmut area there were 85 shelling and 20 combatants. As a result of the fighting, 175 invaders were destroyed and 213 were injured. The enemy T-72 tank was shot down, four combat drifts, three MSTA-B guns, five unmanned aerial vehicles, a single-electronic wrestling one, as well as four field deposits.

According to Colonel Sergei Cherevatov, for the whole period of defense of Bakhmutu -Ukrainian defenders have already destroyed tens of thousands of Russians.

- I think, over time, our military analysts will name the exact figures, but the loss is huge here, - says the officer. - As for the criminal group "Wagner", it is no longer able to perform combat tasks on its own, which has been done earlier, actually monopolizing this direction. Although the "Wagnerivtsi" is the main force that attacks, the Russians in the Bakhmut direction, they can no longer act without the help of a regular army. The more ashable units of the troops of the invaders, the units of special purposes are increasingly used, so we understand that the loss of the enemy is very significant as Wagner is probably the final border.

Live broadcast [TEMACHORFON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)The only news is the head of the united Press Center of Defense forces of Tavriysky, Colonel Alexei Dmitryashkivsky noted that the enemy began to start his artillery component again.

- The enemy firets our positions with almost the same intensity as Tsybul in February, - says the officer. - In yesterday and today, the enemy has almost 500 each position from different artillery systems.

Alexei Dmitrashkivsky told about the assault actions, the enemy 22 times healed the positions of our troops. It happened in the Marinka area, which the enemy was not at attempts to capture to block Avdiivka.

Also, the head of the united Press Center of Defense Forces of Tavriyskaya direction was that yesterday the enemy changed his tactics. So, trying to show the advantage in the air, the enemy increased the number of aviation strikes, and moving to the tactics of group air strikes. That is, two aircraft released Ukrainian air defense, and the third struck.

Due to the improvement of weather conditions, the enemy doubled the number of use of unmanned aerial vehicles yesterday. First of all, the vows are said.

-Also yesterday there was a change in the use of the enemy Dronov-Kamikadze,-continues Alexei Dmitrashkivsky. - Yesterday afternoon, they first consided the Shahledi, which were well knocked down, but after the "Shahmed" appeared "lancets". This was also the purpose of identifying our points of antipyretic defense.

The officer also told about the deterioration of the moral and psychological state of the avalanche, and the news in the Tavriya direction. Yes, he noted that in the recent information about the arrival in the area of Avdiivka of the new tanking unit of the occupying army, it has not shown itself at all, and for the attacks of our positions the enemy uses the fourth day in a row exclusively infantry. Oleksiy Dmitrashkivsky may assume, this is due to the fact that the opponent is not so much selected to use this technique as to demonstrate the effect of its precision.

And in the carbon direction, as the head of the united press center told, a broken enemy of the 155th Brigade of Marine Corps appeared again. However, it is unlikely that it could fully restore the combat capability in such compisormins.

During the day, there was a parsing in the city of Kupyansk Kharkiv region after the Russian shelling of the C-300 missiles. On ordinary civilian. The target for terrorists was the Caraean Museum and adjacent houses. Rossia killed this blow of two women. My condolences to my relatives and loved ones ... Ten people were injured - they are given the necessary help.

In total, more than 60 museums and galleries in different areas of our country are so self -destroyed or damaged by the occupier.

Crimea ... Today, the invaders broke into the house of Abdureshit Jepparova. He is the single representatives of the Crimean Tatar national movement, human rights activist, citizen of Ukraine. Where he is now, which is unknown to him. This is another example of the Crimea's indigenous people, against all our people. Those and thousands of such examples during aggression in the Crimea and in other regions occupied by Russia.

No one can feel safe anywhere until the aggressor is broken. This is the day in Ukraine proves - all that Russian troops and special services are doing on our land against our people. And this is that they dream of bringing other peoples on the ground. The whole world knows it.

The world also knows: Russia can be stopped. This is a common interest. Stop the powerful soldiers on the front line. Our weapons - both Ukrainian and the one we are muscular from partners.

** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!**

First of all, I want to thank our whole team, which deals with the exchange.

It was possible to return home to Ukraine 44 people from Russian captivity. Most are the military. From different directions. Among them are the defenders of Azovstal and Mariupol, other cities of Donetsk region, Kherson, Kharkiv region ... Most are ordinary and sergeants. There are officers. Two are civil.

And it is important that the team works for all those in captivity ... Even if it is difficult, such as some categories of prisoners, and these are not just a military, who are difficult to return, but also, for example, civilians are one of those categories, one of those categories, which is difficult.

We remember everyone. And even if there is no precise information about what happened to, where it can be, such a person is still searched and checked as much as possible. Ukraine has to recover all its.

I thank all of you, the guys who coordinate this work: Budanov, Yermak, Lubin, Usov, Kid, Klimenko ... Thank you to everyone who helps in Gur I Mo, the Voishei, and in the SBU, and in our other structures.

Of course, I thank all our soldiers on the forefront, who collects replenishment for the exchange fund. Every Russian prisoner is an opportunity to exchange our man.

In total, 2279 Ukrainians and Ukrainian women were returned from the Russian captivity during the full -scale war.

He spoke with the leader of China today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our native grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.

Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications.

Today, however, he participated in the conference in Rome, which is dedicated to the reconstruction of our state. It is such a special format of communication of government officials and representatives of the industrial and business of our countries, Ukraine and Italy. In order to be uniformly involved in Ukraine, those who embody the economic power of thectal.

I thank Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this conference for her words for Ukraine's constant support. It is important that we are already planning our cooperation on the 24th year. In particular, this applies to the future Italian presidency of the UG7, as well as the preparation of the Grand Donor Conference on Recovery.

Spent a separate telephone conversation with George. The key theme was already a defense work, the support of our soldiers. Thank you, Italy!

These days we also carry out special work with partners on the coordination of defense quotes and supply. It is very important for Ukraine that anyone who, together with us, is to protect freedom, clearly understood the prospect of our power, we can. The better we understand each other, the easier it is to work in a common victory. For obvious reasons, the details of such communication do not provide publicly.

One more.

He spoke today with the Director of the Grossi. The Chernobyl catastrophe anniversary is the day that everyone is in the world to remind you. And especially when the threat of a radiation disaster in the Zaporizhzhya nuclear stage has been stored every day and every year.

Only full control of Ukraine over the ZPP can also restore full security, and only our country, but all over Europe, all over the world.

Radiation does not recognize state borders in the same way as the Russian Federation. Or more complete compliance with the rules can guarantee safety.

I would like to thank Mr. Grossy on his initiative - a very important social organization - such a special program of medical support for the staff of all nuclear power plants. Thank you for the support of our people!** Glory to all Ukrainian soldiers who are now in battle, at combat posts and assignments!**

** I wish health, dear Ukrainians!**

First of all, I want to thank our whole team, which deals with the exchange.

It was possible to return home to Ukraine 44 people from Russian captivity. Most are the military. From different directions. Among them are the defenders of Azovstal and Mariupol, other cities of Donetsk region, Kherson, Kharkiv region ... Most are ordinary and sergeants. There are officers. Two are civil.

And it is important that the team works for all those in captivity ... Even if it is difficult, such as some categories of prisoners, and these are not just a military, who are difficult to return, but also, for example, civilians are one of those categories, one of those categories, which is difficult.

We remember everyone. And even if there is no precise information about what happened to, where it can be, such a person is still searched and checked as much as possible. Ukraine has to recover all its.

I thank all of you, the guys who coordinate this work: Budanov, Yermak, Lubin, Usov, Kid, Klimenko ... Thank you to everyone who helps in Gur I Mo, the Voishei, and in the SBU, and in our other structures.

Of course, I thank all our soldiers on the forefront, who collects replenishment for the exchange fund. Every Russian prisoner is an opportunity to exchange our man.

In total, 2279 Ukrainians and Ukrainian women were returned from the Russian captivity during the full -scale war.

He spoke with the leader of China today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our native grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.

Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications.

Today, however, he participated in the conference in Rome, which is dedicated to the reconstruction of our state. It is such a special format of communication of government officials and representatives of the industrial and business of our countries, Ukraine and Italy. In order to be uniformly involved in Ukraine, those who embody the economic power of thectal.

I thank Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this conference for her words for Ukraine's constant support. It is important that we are already planning our cooperation on the 24th year. In particular, this applies to the future Italian presidency of the UG7, as well as the preparation of the Grand Donor Conference on Recovery.

Spent a separate telephone conversation with George. The key theme was already a defense work, the support of our soldiers. Thank you, Italy!

These days we also carry out special work with partners on the coordination of defense quotes and supply. It is very important for Ukraine that anyone who, together with us, is to protect freedom, clearly understood the prospect of our power, we can. The better we understand each other, the easier it is to work in a common victory. For obvious reasons, the details of such communication do not provide publicly.

One more.

He spoke today with the Director of the Grossi. The Chernobyl catastrophe anniversary is the day that everyone is in the world to remind you. And especially when the threat of a radiation disaster in the Zaporizhzhya nuclear stage has been stored every day and every year.

Only full control of Ukraine over the ZPP can also restore full security, and only our country, but all over Europe, all over the world.

Radiation does not recognize state borders in the same way as the Russian Federation. Or more complete compliance with the rules can guarantee safety.

I would like to thank Mr. Grossy on his initiative - a very important social organization - such a special program of medical support for the staff of all nuclear power plants. Thank you for the support of our people!** Glory to all Ukrainian soldiers who are now in battle, at combat posts and assignments!**

**Glory to Ukraine!**

The collection of information about prisoners was harvested. All photos and videos that are published by analysts are used. They are verified. The enemy deliberately manipulates that people who return from captivity transmitted the data.

About it [reports](https://t.me/Koord_shtab/903)Coordinating headquarters for the issue of prisoners of war.

The staff representative stressed that only some of our captives were confirmed by the Russian side, but Ukraine is working to return everyone: both those who are considered missing and those whom the Russian Federation did not confirm, but the consciousness of captivity. And it often succeeds.

The relatives are worried about whether their defenders and defenders are submitting to exchange. Alerosia of hundreds of the submitted can only agree to exchange a few. The final decision to whom will be changed is made by the party that holds the prisoners. Ukrainian sales funds to return everyone - regardless of the unit or place of detention.

“The enemy spreads a lot of false data on social networks to then say that Ukraine does nothing to return its people. But if it was true, exchanges would happen after the fighting was completed, as during the previous wars. And we have already managed to return more than two thousand prisoners, ”the headquarters representative said.

I will say that our vision - people's deputies, representatives of states - such that of course, the military administration must first be created in the Crimea. Then there is a transition to a military-civil administration, then-elections and transition to civilian life. It is very important for us that young people are involved. They should become frames of development that will go to the Crimean peninsula and rebuild our Crimea, - said Tamila Tasheva.

- We are working on the first steps to be taken after the Crimean Peninsula is released. The first of them is undoubtedly ensuring the safety of citizens who live there. The second is the demilitarization of the Peninsula of the Switches. The third step is to bring the guilty to account. People who committed criminal offenses against our country will be held reference. And those who have illegally arrived at the peninsula have to collapse it, we will be published. The next step is the restoration of the authorities. Also, we must make the Russian media do not prevail. There should be an honest opinion of the Ukrainian authorities, should have accessible media. People should stop living in a vacuum of Russian propaganda, - said Anatoly Stelmach.

About it [reports](https://www.facebook.com/SecurSerUkraine/posts/pfbid02r95zUFM2tcoQ1r1jiB1suK5enNmXMMTqQrEMkZXRYUUL7YEgABSEWu2BoYixpA6Ql)Security Service of Ukraine.

SBU investigators reported the person being suspected of two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:

▪️ Part 1 of Art. 110(encroachment on territorial integrity and integrity of Ukraine);

▪️ Part 1 v. 111(high treason).

За матеріалами слідства, перебуваючи на території українського півострова, уквітні 2014 року він створив пропагандистське інтернет-видання на користькраїни-агресора.

Власний медійний ресурс Степанов використовував для поширення кремлівськихнаративів та дискредитації України на міжнародній арені.

До злочинної діяльності він залучив своїх «однодумців», які потім займалисяпідготовкою антиукраїнських матеріалів

Для маскування злочинної діяльності псевдожурналісти діяли як позаштатнікореспонденти під вигаданими іменами і позиціонували себе «експертами».

У своїх публікаціях вони виправдовували російську збройну агресію і захопленнячастини території на сході та півдні України.

Перед написанням пропагандистських текстів «автори» отримували від Степановапокрокові «інструкції» щодо підготовки матеріалів.

За поширення деструктивного контенту вони отримували від окупантів «гонорари».Гроші їм надходили через російські електронні платіжні системи.

У квітні та липні минулого року співробітники Служби безпеки затримали двохфейкових «експертів» у Києві та Вінниці. Зараз вони перебувають під вартою.

Ініційована СБУ судово-лінгвістична експертиза підтвердила факти інформаційно-підривної діяльності Степанова та його спільників.

Наразі тривають заходи щодо його притягнення до відповідальності за злочинипроти державної безпеки України. Матеріали передано в суд.

Зловмиснику загрожує до 15 років ув’язнення.

Розслідування проводили співробітники СБУ у Вінницькій області запроцесуального керівництва обласної прокуратури.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-maye-unikalnij-dosvid-zahistu-derzhavi-ta-lyudej-v-82493)During a speech at the final panel conference on the restoration of Ukraine in Rome:

“Ms. Prime Minister Italy!

Mr. Prime Minister of Ukraine!

Ms. Vice President of the Confederation of the Italian Industry!

Ladies and Gentlemen!Dear present!The road Italie!

Thank you for this conference and sincere interest in Ukraine. I know that the menesluks are representatives and representatives of hundreds of Italian and Ukrainian companies, and I would like to turn to you not just as those who embody the business. And as to dads and moms, to sons and daughters, as to the representatives of your communities, your cities, your country ...

There are completely different people, different families, different generations, but we are in fact one aspirations with you. We all want freedom and normal development for our children, we want safety and well -being for our parents. The desires and lightness of life for their communities and cities. And it unites us.

And this is what I suggest talking about.

About how we can give you more safety to our families together. Most weave our countries. More freedom to Ukrainian and Italian children. More guarantees of normal life for our communities and our cities.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

It is already clear when and what this war should end, which Russia has solved anti -nouns. Against all of us. Against Ukraine and all our common European home, who gave a chance for a peaceful life and prosperity to all European peoples. I have a doubt that we are able to win. Because we not only believe in our own strength, but we stand and protect our common values in unity. In unity!Whoever keeps unity and does not lose strength, he wins.

I want to thank all of Italy now, all your people and communities, your leadership and personally Ms. Prime Minister George Meloni for this unity. The unity of Europeans who know that beyond our freedom, that is, where all of us in Europe wants to reject Russia, there can be no normal and dangerous life.

We have to do - and we will do!- All that this Russian war ended in Russian. And so, this year we have to do everything to the maximum to prepare the largest economic project of our time in Europe - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine.In this war, the world saw that it was necessary for the real protection of every nation. It has been awarded how to change energy and infrastructure, production of and logistics, cyber systems and educational space, the defense industry of the army.

Therefore, there is a demand for new security standards in the world to make every country beyond any manifestations of aggression, terror or element. And we will create such security standards in Ukraine.

I will give you five examples that will show you the practical meaning of what I say.

The first is energy.

Russia has launched a real energyaging against Europe. She provoked the price crisis of impoverishment of millions of families because of the growth of accounts. She tried to produce physical supply of fuel to Europe. She beat rockets and Iranian Drones on our energy so that Ukrainians remain without electricity and heat. Europe stood. We answered this call with dignity. And we must do everything to make the enemy not the theoretical opportunity to break the nurser gun.

The "green" transformation of energy and a kind of decentralization of production is a response. The more manufacturers - "green" energy producers, is a more toxic system. The more sources of supply, the more reliably the city, every community and every family is provided.

Plus Italy is one of the leaders in creating "smart" networks(smart grids).Тому я запрошую ваші компанії разом розвивати українські мережі. І, будьласка, не забувайте, що в найближчій перспективі українські мережі будутьмережами Євросоюзу.

Друге — власне будівництво.

Українці ніколи не здадуть своєї країни ворогу й ніколи не полишать своєїземлі. Хоч сотні наших сіл і десятки міст спалені ударами російської артилеріїта авіації, українці здатні повернути їх до життя. Не у звичці нашого народу —залишати на своїй землі рани, що не загоїлися.

Ми маємо колосальну потребу у відбудові тисяч будинків, сотень шкіл, лікарень,транспортної, виробничої інфраструктури. Причому на новій безпековій основі,яка має стати типовою для інших країн, для міст у тих країнах, де люди вхороші часи можуть і не задумуватися про безпеку. Але розуміють, що гарантіїпотрібні.

Щоб кожен батько був спокійним за свою дитину у школі — бо там є сховище,безпечне місце, яке гарантує захист. Щоб кожна мати знала: у її громаді, у їїмісті безпекова інфраструктура влаштована так, що будь-який терорист — чидержава, як Росія, чи якась терористична організація — точно програє наявнійсистемі безпеки.

The third example is technologies.

Full -scale Russian aggression did not break Ukrainian finances, banking system, digital services that our people are used to.

We have preserved the connection in the country and all that is not to imagine modern life. Babil, we have attracted our Aviters to the cyber defense of the state and the economy. Miporoborons were constructed by the country. We continue to develop an action state service that provides access to public services through a smartphone or portal.

In addition, partners in Europe are already taking our "action" for their digital development.

Our defense industry is gaining momentum even now when the war is brushing. We are interested in the localization in Ukraine of the production of such military equipment we receive from partners. We build new produce of our own weapons and ammunition. We create new protection tools such as floxes as a wide range of drones for our front.

I am sure that your companies have something to add to these stories of Ukrainian success.

The fourth is global markets.

The world has already understood the potential of our country's agrarian sector. Ukrainian is to guarantee global food stability. Supply from Ukraine is food on the tables of millions of families in different countries, including Africa, Asia. Pulge to Ethiopia, from Lebanon to Yemen. Without our supply to some countries, the chaos would be accumulated. And that means - there would be new waves of migration, including Uevrop.

In addition, there is no such considerable potential for green metallurgy in Ukraine in Europe. From iron ore to lithium and other maximum -needed resources - all this is Ukraine. From natural gas to the way ... We can give - and give!- All this global markets. We can largely replace the company with Russia - those who have chosen work for war, not a mentally development.

But the number one task is processing. So, these are new enterprises. So, it is new logistics and modernization of transport. So, these are new investments. Aotge, these are profits. And I am sure that your companies too.

And the fifth example - and this is far from the last of cooperation - pharmaceutical and rehabilitation.

There is a purely economic fact: Ukraine is a huge market and net import pharmaceutical goods. One thing already means that the localization of the production of in Ukraine gives an obvious benefit.To finish the war is, in particular, to quench the pain that was survived in the war, brought from the war, associated with the war. Obviously, we will work over this in Ukraine - and together with the best representatives of the world.

Ukraine sees what is the key security demand. Ukraine has a unique experience in the protection of the state and people in the face of aggression and all possible manifestations of the terror. There is no such evil that Russia would not try to do against Ukrainians, which we would not have to defend.

Our experience of protection is successful and scales on the lives of other peoples, other countries.

It is logical that our experience will become part of the new security foundation of the world. Asks you, Italy, to build a new security with us!I invite you, your investments, your experience is now coming to Ukraine.

Please in contact with our delegation at the conference with the Panpremier of Ukraine. Ukraine is ready for cooperation!

Glory to all who bring our victory closer!

Grazie Italia!

Glory to Ukraine!".

About it [reports](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zatrymala-u-kyievi-ta-odesi-dvokh-kolaborantok-yaki-khovalysia-vid-pravosuddia)Security Service of Ukraine.

Among the detainees is the former head of one of the "departments" created by the aggressor "Basin water management of Kherson region".

In this "position" she participated in the establishment of water supply for the need for the need for the need for the Russian Federation, which were stationed on the temporarily captured territory of the region.

To do this, she formed the staff of the department and called on the locals to join the ranks of the pseudo -institution.

Before dismissing the regional center, the collaborator fled to Kiev, where she planned to "get lost" among the residents of the capital and thus avoid justice.

However, the SBU staff installed its location and detained.

Another head of the aggressor was a resident of Kherson, who during the period of the city was settled with the invaders of the "Regional Pension Fund".

There, the malefactor was involved in the instructions of Moscow to introduce a "ruble zone" in the region.

It is established that the person involved forced the elderly to receive pensions of Urosian currency.

After the liberation of the city, the malefactor escaped to Odessa, where her delayed contractors of the SBU.

During the searches at the place of temporary residence, the cash of the Urosian rubles was found, which the invaders charged her as a "salary".

Currently, both involved persons have been informed of suspicion under Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine(Collaboration).

Одній з них суд уже обрав запобіжний захід — тримання під вартою.

Розслідування проводили співробітники СБУ у Херсонській та Одеській областяхза процесуального керівництва органів прокуратури.

“He spoke to China's leader today. It was a long and rather rational conversation. Such conversations are usually said that they open up.

It is possible to apply China's political influence to regain power by the principles of the rules on which peace should be kept. Ukraine and China, as well as the absoluteness of the world, are equally interested in the strength of the sovereignty of nations of iterial integrity ... in compliance with the main security rules, including inadmissibility of threats to nuclear weapons and the distribution of nuclear weapons. We are equally interested that the situation around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant is fully protected and that the nuclear power plants are not used for the sake of military purposes at all - namely cynical use of nuclear power plants, Russia is trying to make the norm.

It is very important that China has the same view of the freedom of navigation of itworks. I informed Mr. Xi Jinping about our efforts to restore the Mountain exports of food. And I heard the words of support of our Sea grain initiative, its extension, as well as to support our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain Program from Ukraine.

Of course, a essential part of the conversation is our views on how a ricious peace can be restored. I presented the Ukrainian formula of peace, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications, ”the Head of State said.
