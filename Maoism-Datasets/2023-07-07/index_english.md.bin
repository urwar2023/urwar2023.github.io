The Zaporizhzhya NPP unit has been commissioned more than 34 years ago. Therefore, to maintain the safe operation of blocks, it is necessary to conduct special and quality maintenance and repair of equipment, without which their operation is becoming dangerous.

About it [reports](https://t.me/energoatom_ua/13864)NNEGC "Energoatom" Utelegram.

Since the beginning of the full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the unit No. 5 has worked at the energy levels of power, and since September 2022 the occupation administration of the station has supported its work in a state of hot stop. Already, the invaders deliberately violate a number of basic requirements for the operation of the energy block, including ignoring the planned schedule of maintenance of system safety, sabotage of overhaul of equipment of the reactor department of the reactor department of the oil -mechanical repair, electrical equipment of the turbine supply and control systems.

In addition, the service life of the equipment that is subject to replacement is exhausted. In particular, more than 1000 units of thermal mechanical equipment and more than 100 - electrical.

The complex of these violations has serious consequences and many times increases the risk of systems that can lead to an emergency. In this case, the countries of Europe may be affected by radiation influence.

SE "NNEGC" Energoatom ", in order to implement the decision of the State Inspectorate of Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine, repeatedly urged to transfer the unit No. 5 of the NPP NPPs -" Cold stop ". Last week, Diara sent a letter to the reference to assist the order. But despite the involvement of international organizations, all efforts have not achieved the goal.

The contractors, being in plot, through the controlled firms carried out the procurement of elevators and components. After that, they were delivered to the utility company at a price much higher than the market. In some cases, the overestimation of the purchased elevators was more than 400 thousand UAH per unit.

The losses established at this time amount to more than UAH 1.3 million.

In addition, within the framework of the pre -trial investigation, personal conversations were recorded by the inter -workers of contractors, according to which the executors of the work of the elevators were known in establishing poor elevator equipment and deliberately assumed the possibility of human casualties during its time.

On the basis of the court order by law enforcement officers at the place of work and residence of persons involved in the unlawful scheme, more than 20 searches were conducted.

The issue of choosing a suspect is resolved.

Other agreements concluded by these business entities are ongoing in order to waste budgetary funds.

‚ÄúThe Netherlands has already adopted the register of losses, which is now starting their work.

The Irouga component is the prosecution of all the guilty Uzllochni, ranging from the highest political leadership of the Russian Federation - the state of the aggressor. Here we are talking about the tribunal. As about the final result of the trekuvidality of the Russian Federation. We are now confidently moving with our partners, ‚ÄùKarasevich emphasized.

This was stated by the Secretary General of the Alliance Jens Stoltenberg at the Brussels Press Conference, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

‚ÄúThe war is by nature dangerous and unpredictable. Undoubtedly, we are monitoring and very closely monitor the situation around Zaporizhzhya located there. We welcome the fact that the IAEA also conducts careful monitoring of this situation and has its experts there. This is important because the Zaporizhzhya NPP is the largest in Europe, ‚Äù - said Stoltenberg.

According to him, the IAEA performs its mandate, and [NATO](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)Supports the efforts of this organization to overcome the standards of nuclear security, which is a huge challenge in the face.

The best message from NATO and the deputy is that Russia should not attack from the NPP, it does not have a nuclear power station and must withdraw its troops from there. This will allow the experts to perform their duties best and check that there are no mines or explosives at the station, ‚Äùsaid NATO Secretary General.

He added that IAEA experts have applied for additional access, to refer to the station's safety measures.

This will cause significant economic harm to Ukraine, as it will mean the loss of a quarter of the generating power.

According to Ukrinform, this opinion is on the air [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101797)Dr. Physical and Mathematical Sciences, expert on nuclear energy Lytvinsky, commented on the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence Kirill Budanov that the threat to the Zaporizhzhya NPP decreases.

According to Litvinsky, the Apocalypse at the ZPP in any case is unstable, but the threat was both stored. "There is a monkey, a monkey of Yegranat, and where she will throw that grenade, even she does not know herself. Everything is very simple," the expert said.

In his opinion, it is for the better that [ZPES](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-aes)It is not produced by electricity because when the reactor is stopped, it does not work out the decomposition products, new radionuclides. That is why, even with the worst -scenario, the radioactive cloud will not contain iodine isotopes, which are the most harmful in the case of a nuclear power plant. Since it took half a year, all iodine. Therefore, according to the worst scenario, there will even be such a componentazagrosis, Litvinsky notes. However, he emphasizes that "to bring to a serious allotment at the Zaporozhye NPP is quite simple, if there is a stupid desire. Therefore, it will be threatened until there is a" goodwill gesture "from those who are now being held."

The most threatening, he said, is a script with the destruction of the second contour and as a consequence - the inability to cool the atomic reactor. The tsenhego scenario is fundamentally possible if you do not consider the destruction of the reactor department.

However, according to Litvinsky, the most likely the maximum damage to Zaporizhia atomic will be caused "so that it does not produce electricity during a year. That is, the racists, departing, will do everything on the principle of" unpopular you. " . This is quite expected and realistically, and unfortunately, Minyak cannot prevent it. "

"The main mining for the population will be the loss of a quarter of Ukraine's generating capacity. It is most important for the country. Most likely, there will be no radiation accident. Lithuanian summed up.

As reported by Ukrinform, the day before the head of GUR Kirill Budanov [declared](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3732061-zagroza-na-zaes-pocinae-spadati-budanov.html)that the threat of a catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhya NPP is currently decreasing. He refused to name the reasons for this conclusion, but noted that "certain public and non -public actions in this area" were brought to this.

At the same time in NAEK "Energoatom" [reported](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3732061-zagroza-na-zaes-pocinae-spadati-budanov.html)that the occupying unit is transferred to the unit # 4 to the Zaporizhzhya NPP into the state of "hot stomach". At the same time, the invaders do not deliberately execute the decision of the Ukrainian regulator and do not derive the unit # 5 in the Cold Stock. Therefore, in the case of functioning of two power units in a state of "hot stop" - at the station hereal threat of an emergency situation.

On June 22, 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared plans for a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia NPP.In an interview with Spanish journalists, Zelensky declared July 1 that the situation of Nazaporozhye NPP is very difficult - it is replaced, and there are militants.

The signing of an appeal at the Warsaw Cathedral named after St. Ivankhrestist was held during the worship of Ukrainian and Polish in the event of Ukrainians and Poles, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

According to the head of the UGCC Svyatoslav Shevchuk during the Divine Service, Russian agression against Ukraine, which lasts since 2014, proves once again that ‚Äúreconciliation between our peoples and the cooperation of free [Poland](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-polsa)And free Ukraine is the necessary conditions in our part of Europe. ‚Äù

"Otherwise, the card will play the third," Shevchuk emphasized.

He noted that, first of all, they were Poles, the Ukrainians, as well as those who rescued relatives and neighbors from danger.

The head of the UGCC stressed that reconciliation is not about forgetting, but about overcoming evil from the past, and to put above what unites, not what divides. "

"Today, after the opening of the mass burials in Bucha, Irpen or Gostomel, we will all understand how important it is to call the guilty, exhumulate the victims, honor the right to a decent burial and human memory," Shevchuk emphasized.

"It is paradoxical that the result of the Russian attempt to destroy the Ukrainian people with a linning between our peoples," Shevchuk emphasized.

He called the patron saint on the path of Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation on John Paulii. According to him, it was the Pope who took the patronage over the approximation of both natives.

In his turn, the head of the Polish bishopric conference, Stanislav Gondetsky, during his speech, appealed to the presidents and premieres of both countries "in the case of trial honoring of all victims of genocide, which should be exhumidated." According to him, the burial of the Polish victims of the Volyn tragedy is a religious character.

It is known that the topic of the Volyn tragedy is one of the most controversial in Ukrainian-Polish relations. The views of Kiev and Warsaw on the reasons, responsibility and number of victims on both sides are somewhat different. The Polish castor insists that the exclusive responsibility for the crime committed in 1943-1944 in Volyn is bearing the Ukrainian side, but instead the Ukrainian side assures that both sides should be responsible and the apology should be prisoner.

The theme of the Volyn tragedy in recent years is now actively using Russian propaganda to quarrel Ukraine and Poland.

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/eu-says-high-cost-of-sanctions-on-russia-will-grow-for-years)with reference to the relevant confessional commission.

The report states that sanctions ‚Äúsignificantly worsened industrial and technological potential [Russia](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)‚Äù.

"These consequences will intensify even more over time, as measures have a long -term impact on the budget of Russia, financial markets, foreign investments and its industrial and technological base," - said.

The document contains a description of the consequences of EU sanctions against Moscow that reduced 91 billion euros of imports from the Russian Federation and covered 48 billion euros of exportallance.

According to the European Commission, in 2023, almost a third of the Russian federal budget will be spent on defense and internal security.

Meanwhile, exports from the EU and imports from Russia have fallen by more than 50% compared to 2021. This provoked a particularly rapid decline in technologically dependent industries of the processing industry.

Exports of dual-use goods and advanced technologies were strong-78% in 2022 compared to 2019-2021.

Thanks to measures aimed at minimizing the impact on Member States, the influence of Nays was restrained, but it was noticeable in some areas mainly due to Russia's contractors and because of the war, which caused rising prices.

At the same time, the Russian Federation was able to obtain some sub -goods and other substittories from third countries, in particular from China, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the UAE, according to the report.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the UBRUSSEL Press Conference, answering Ukrinform correspondent's questions about the possibility of the Alliance at the Vilnius Guarantee for Ukraine.

‚ÄúWhen the war is over, it will be important to have the framework conditions, which will ensure that President Putin and Russia will not be able to give their rest, redeem them, carry out their training, re -arry and re -fate. We have to create such framework conditions to give Ukraine everything that it needs to be able to attack again, ‚Äù - said [Stoltenberg](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stoltenberg).

According to him, the urgent task for the Allies is military support for Ukraine. The more Ukraine will be liberated, the stronger its positions at the negotiation table in order to find ways for a wide, long and fair end of this war.

‚ÄúThis is exactly what the allies are discussing. This is part of the discussion of the issue of membership(Ukraine)in NATO. I am convinced that we, as allies, we will find a common way to move in response to a request of Ukraine for a member. We will also make important decisions on mutual mutual and other things that will bring Ukraine closer to NATO, ‚Äùsaid the Alliance head.

He noted that several souzers are holding bilateral(in some cases multilateral)Consultations with Ukraine regarding all kinds of security and possible efforts in this area. NATO Allies are informed by consultations that will supplement the joint efforts of the Alliance to support Ukraine, which NATO's continuation is asking for all Union countries.

‚ÄúWe make our decisions as sovereign independent states, together with Ukraine, so it is not a matter of Russia - to deny or veto such decisions. We use Ukraine to win this war, we provide it with military assistance and do it to do so, ‚ÄùStoltenberg stressed.

The savings are expected to be achieved by the participation of new suppliers and ensuring their non -discrimination by potential customers. Additionally, medical customers will spend less time and efforts to conduct purchases than using the open bidding tool.

If the purchase with the use of the electronic catalog by requesting the suppliers' proposals has not taken place, the customer shall be purchased by the use of open bidding, without increasing the expectation of the procurement. Or he can re -request the price of suppliers in the electronic catalog.More than 160 names are approved by the Government of the list of medicines and medical products. It was formed on the basis of analysis of the positions most purchased by customers in 2022 in the medical part of the electronic catalog of Prozorro Market.

‚ÄúWe expect that [special tribunal](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-tribunal)will be placed in the Hague. From the Netherlands government, we have received a clear signal support. And this is not a coincidence, since it is the Netherlands that Evendier for the track of bringing the Russian Federation to justice, the track of the formula of peace -president Vladimir Zelensky. The Netherlands has already done a lot on this way and, I am sure that many more will do, ‚ÄùKarasevich said.

He also noted that the Hague has already created a new international organization - an international register of losses caused to Ukraine by Russian aggression.

‚ÄúThe Netherlands has already adopted the register of losses, which is now starting their work. This mechanism was created at the Council of Europe and is one sedative components of the track of responsibility. When we talk about the register, we will make a moment about the mechanism of compensation for the losses that are currently being built. The Irouga component is the prosecution of all the guilty Uzllochni, ranging from the highest political leadership of the Russian Federation - the state of the aggressor. Here we are talking about the tribunal. As about the final result of the trekuvidality of the Russian Federation. We are now confidently moving with our partners, ‚ÄùKarasevich emphasized.

This is stated in the Public Fund on Friday [document](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/CR/2023/English/1UKREA2023002.ashx), reports Ukrinform.

It is noted that the increase in the number of beacons was proposed by the Ukrainian Page "to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability in the face of war, as well as to support the impulse of reforms."

In addition, in addition to the previous requirements, Ukraine has undertaken by the end of September 2023 to put into effect the article of the Budget Code, which allow you to prepare the medium -term budget, develop a debt strategy and limit the risk of guarantees.

By the same term, the Ukrainian side should also develop a conceptual record of the 5-7-9 percent lending program. The document must contain proposals for small and medium -sized enterprises with the gradual abolition of participation companies, as well as strengthening of monitoring and providing adequate guarantee.

Another new structural beacon concerns the preparation of short -term and long -term action plans of the Ministry of Finance, tax and customs services for reform in key areas. Deadline for this requirement is determined by the end of October this year.

This was stated during a pressing in Washington by US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"We are establishing our decision on security assistance on the direct requires of Ukraine on the ground, and Ukraine needs artillery to support its complex and defense operations," Sullivan said.

He noted that the United States gave Ukraine a "historical number" of ordinary artillery ammunition and increasing their production. "But this process will need time, so it is critical to provide Ukraine with a bridge of supply while our domestic production is growing," Bellot's representative explained.

‚ÄúAgainst this background, Ukraine asks cassette ammunition to protect its sovereigntyrate. The cassette ammunition we can provide has much lower refusal indicators than in Russia - no more than 2.5%, ‚Äùhe said.

The agreed position urgently mobilizes EU 500 million from the EU budget to support the increase in production capacity for the production of ammunition type "Earth-Earth", artillery ammunition, as well as rockets.

This will ensure a long-term increase in production in Europe in favor of Ukraine and EU Member States.

‚ÄúThanks to the short -term period of the ASAP Agreement, the EU will strengthen and will grow up its own production of ammunition and missiles in Europe. It is another evidential devotion to the EU to support Ukraine, to strengthen the defense and technological and EU industrial base and, ultimately, to ensure long-term security of the EU citizens' pelvic protection, ‚Äùsaid Spanish Defense Minister Margarit Robles.

Coordinated rules introduce a certain tool by which ESFINANCE will support the strengthening of EU capacity for industrial production and missiles in the entire supply and cost chain. Such financial support will be given in the form of grants that will contribute to the efforts of the European defense industry to increase the production capacity of tasivity of detected narrow places.

In addition, new rules will facilitate access to funding for EU companies of ammunition and missiles through a particular fund, which is intended to facilitate the companies that produce ammunition and missiles, access to state and private funding to accelerate the investments needed to increase production capacity.

‚ÄúI congratulate the political agreement on ASAP. The law on the support of industrial supplies will increase the production capacity of the EU and replenish reserves. It will grow up the delivery of ammunition to Ukraine at this responsible stage, ‚Äù - [emphasized](https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1677170313228853248)The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Lien._ Prepared Vitaliy Lytvyn_

This was stated during a pressing in Washington by US Presidential Advisor Jake Sullivan, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"We are establishing our decision on security assistance on the direct requires of Ukraine on the ground, and Ukraine needs artillery to support its complex and defense operations," Sullivan said.

He noted that the United States gave Ukraine a "historical number" of ordinary artillery ammunition and increasing their production. "But this process will need time, so it is critical to provide Ukraine with a bridge of supply while our domestic production is growing," Bellot's representative explained.

‚ÄúAgainst this background, Ukraine asks cassette ammunition to protect its sovereigntyrate. The cassette ammunition we can provide has much lower refusal indicators than in Russia - no more than 2.5%, ‚Äùhe said.

In this connection, Sullivan confirmed that the United States is cooperating with Ukraine, which "makes efforts to mine after conflict to reduce any potential damage to the civilian population." And it will need to be done, said Baiden's assistant.

![](Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-07-07T40-00-00-04-00/zelenskyj-2.jpg)President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is convinced that a clear invitation of Ukraine to future NATO membership at [Vilnius Samite](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/11/09/nastupnyj-samit-nato-vidbudetsya-vlitku-2023-roku-v-lytvi/)It will be a significant demonstration of courage and strength.

The head of Ukraine [stated](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/chitke-zaproshennya-ukrayini-do-chlenstva-v-nato-prodemonstr-84133)During the meeting with media representatives after negotiation with Czech colleague Peter Pavel Uprazi.

‚ÄúJust a need for an invitation. We understand that there can be difficulties with the more formulation to get the combined support of all Saliza partners. Someone still looks at Moscow, someone is afraid of Russia. Although I believe that this is such a moment - a great chance to show the courage and strength of the whole alleyman, ‚ÄùVolodymyr Zelenskyy said.

The President stressed that Ukraine is expecting a specific signal to invite Donato.

‚ÄúWe need this motivation. We need honesty in our relationship, ‚Äùthe Ukrainian president explains.

According to the Head of State, today the North Atlantic Alliance also requires a winner - successful actions that will demonstrate its strength and unity.

‚ÄúThe Alliance has not yet found a common signal about Sweden, so Sweden is still in NATO. And there is no decision on Swedish membership. There is also no invitation in that form in Ukraine. What is the success of the Alliance then? And it is minimized that the world, its peoples and Russia also needs to demonstrate the alliance and unity, ‚ÄùVolodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced.

We will remind, earlier the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov [declared](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/06/oboronni-potreby-ukrayiny-nato-konczepcziya-armiyi-majbutnogo-oleksij-reznikov-zustrivsya-z-predstavnykamy-yevropejskoyi-rady-z-mizhnarodnyh-vidnosyn/)that Ukraine's membership in the Alliance is an absolute interest of NATO, since the Ukrainian army is the only one in the world that has a rich combat experience in deterring and reflecting Russian troops.

The highly profitable Ukrainian defense-industrial complex should become one malicious masks of achieving the goal of "GDP-$ 1 trillion".

On this [emphasized](https://interfax.com.ua/news/blog/921329.html)Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov in the author's column of the information agency "Interfax-Ukraine".

‚ÄúI have repeatedly stated my position - self -sufficiency in the provision of OWT is a component of real sovereignty. We have to produce everything that they are capable, ‚Äùthe Minister of Defense of Ukraine aspassed.

According to Alexei Reznikov, we have an advantage - the experience of combat use of arms. Powerful manufacturers are ready to develop partnership with Ukraine. So this one should take advantage of this.

‚ÄúTo do this, Ukraine requires a new Development Strategy for Development, which should consider world trends and economic factors that affect the creation. It is necessary to abandon the Soviet model, programmed rabbit and consumption of resources.

The Ukrainian defense industry should become one of the economy drivers. This means - to be able to play by the world rules in the global market, to generate a cost. Our path is not isolation, but cooperation, ‚Äùhe said.

At the same time, Alexei Reznikov believes to move rapidly, a single center forming and implementing policies in this area, with very flexible R&D support tools, production capacity development and more.

‚ÄúChanges in the procurement system in terms of synchronization with budget planning and refusing to approve plans for defense purchases with blurred responsibility and lack of software planning method. We are already preparing them - the Defense Ministry has initiated a new NATO support program(Inspection of procurement)that will be embodied with the NSPA, ‚Äùthe Ministry of Ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov summarized.

![](Images/A–†–ú–Ü–ØINFORM/2023-07-07T44-00-00-04-00/252558.jpg)The Ukrainian Defense Department has prepared the concept of transformation of sector.

About it in the author's column of the information agency "Interfax-Ukraine" [wrote](https://interfax.com.ua/news/blog/921329.html)Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov.

‚ÄúWe started preparing for the formation of the Army of the Army of the Future a year ago - in 2022 I signed an order to carry out the inspection of the capacity of the Armored Forces of Ukraine. The assessment of the capabilities - that is, the balance of the challenges of the tarelny ability to answer them - is a basic element of defense planning on NATO principles. The review is completed. Based on the analysis of this material, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the experience of war, the Ministry of Defense prepared the concept of transformation of the Defense Sector of Ukraine. In early June, he submitted this document to the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmigal, ‚Äùthe head of the Ukrainian Defense Office reported.

Alexei Reznikov emphasizes that much of the necessary decisions have an interagency character, requires changes to the legislation and concerns the competence of the mine, Ministry of Veterans, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Finance, and the like. Ensuring interagency synergies from the start is actually a success. The head of government pays special attention to it.

‚ÄúOn July 5, Prime Minister Denis Shmigal was presented on the implementation of the Security and Defense Sector Reform and Defense Reforms Program‚Äú [Ukrainian Shield](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/06/v-uryadi-obgovoryly-pytannya-shhodo-reformy-bezpeky-ta-oborony-ukrayiny/)¬ª, During which the colleagile is presented the vision of the Ministry of Defense regarding the necessary transformations. Posting with colleagues our joint proposals will become part of the discussion on [Ukrainian doctrine](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/29/volodymyr-zelenskyj-zaproponuvav-osnovni-napryamy-transformacziyi-yaku-ukrayina-maye-zdijsnyty-za-desyatyrichchya/), initiated by the President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky, ‚Äù - said Alexei Reznikov.

The Ukrainian Defense Minister insists: the enemy has proved that defense is a non -loss, and investments. The capable defense will generate resources.

‚ÄúThe strengthening of the Navy is a guarantee of safe navigation of the Soviet and Azov Seas, these are our income from trade. Inaccessible defense is a fuse against any recovery, a reliable guarantee of preserving the ruins. We have to prove the awareness of these ties in the decisions, ‚ÄùOleksireznikov explained.‚ÄúWe begin planning and design of defense transformations in the face of high degree of uncertainty. We know that the war will end in our way, but we do not know when for sure. This, for example, prevents the system optimization of the "zoo" of the weapon, which we repel the occupiers. Adengam needs all possible weapons, more and faster. We do not know when the decision of partners on the complete integration of our country is accurately addressed. And this is fundamentally. The reform of the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a part of collective defense is one thing. It is consistent with partner functional, capabilities, planned resources, access to information of tatechnology, etc. The formation of capabilities for defense alone with partial support support is another. That is why now one of my main requests for partners is that it is necessary to make a decision on Ukraine's accession as soon as possible. Then it will be easier for us and it is easier for us. Or, if we do not expect such a decision in the near future, Ukraine needs to include Ukraine's defense planning of Nadvich partners(many)third -party basis. Considering the high degree of uncertainty, a flexible flexible matrix of defensive transformations, which would allow to specify the magnification of the steps as it is moving, ‚ÄùAlexei Reznikov summarized.
