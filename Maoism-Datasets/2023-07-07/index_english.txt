 The greatest scenario in the case of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhya NPP is the tasage of maximum damage to the station so that it does not produce electricity in the year or several years. This will cause significant economic harm to Ukraine, as it will mean the loss of a quarter of the generating power.
According to Ukrinform, this opinion is on the air Ukrainian radio Dr. Physical and Mathematical Sciences, expert on nuclear energy Lytvinsky, commented on the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence Kirill Budanov that the threat to the Zaporizhzhya NPP decreases.
According to Litvinsky, the Apocalypse at the ZPP in any case is unstable, but the threat was both stored. "There is a monkey, a monkey of Yegranat, and where she will throw that grenade, even she does not know herself. Everything is very simple," the expert said.
In his opinion, it is for the better that ZPES It is not produced by electricity because when the reactor is stopped, it does not work out the decomposition products, new radionuclides. That is why, even with the worst -scenario, the radioactive cloud will not contain iodine isotopes, which are the most harmful in the case of a nuclear power plant. Since it took half a year, all iodine. Therefore, according to the worst scenario, there will even be such a componentazagrosis, Litvinsky notes. However, he emphasizes that "to bring to a serious allotment at the Zaporozhye NPP is quite simple, if there is a stupid desire. Therefore, it will be threatened until there is a" goodwill gesture "from those who are now being held."

The most threatening, he said, is a script with the destruction of the second contour and as a consequence - the inability to cool the atomic reactor. The tsenhego scenario is fundamentally possible if you do not consider the destruction of the reactor department.
However, according to Litvinsky, the most likely the maximum damage to Zaporizhia atomic will be caused "so that it does not produce electricity during a year. That is, the racists, departing, will do everything on the principle of" unpopular you. " . This is quite expected and realistically, and unfortunately, Minyak cannot prevent it. "

"The main mining for the population will be the loss of a quarter of Ukraine's generating capacity. It is most important for the country. Most likely, there will be no radiation accident. Lithuanian summed up.
As reported by Ukrinform, the day before the head of GUR Kirill Budanov declared that the threat of a catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhya NPP is currently decreasing. He refused to name the reasons for this conclusion, but noted that "certain public and non -public actions in this area" were brought to this.
At the same time in NAEK "Energoatom" reported that the occupying unit is transferred to the unit # 4 to the Zaporizhzhya NPP into the state of "hot stomach". At the same time, the invaders do not deliberately execute the decision of the Ukrainian regulator and do not derive the unit # 5 in the Cold Stock. Therefore, in the case of functioning of two power units in a state of "hot stop" - at the station hereal threat of an emergency situation.

He noted that, first of all, they were Poles, the Ukrainians, as well as those who rescued relatives and neighbors from danger.
The head of the UGCC stressed that reconciliation is not about forgetting, but about overcoming evil from the past, and to put above what unites, not what divides. "

It is known that the topic of the Volyn tragedy is one of the most controversial in Ukrainian-Polish relations. The views of Kiev and Warsaw on the reasons, responsibility and number of victims on both sides are somewhat different. The Polish castor insists that the exclusive responsibility for the crime committed in 1943-1944 in Volyn is bearing the Ukrainian side, but instead the Ukrainian side assures that both sides should be responsible and the apology should be prisoner.
The theme of the Volyn tragedy in recent years is now actively using Russian propaganda to quarrel Ukraine and Poland.

The document contains a description of the consequences of EU sanctions against Moscow that reduced 91 billion euros of imports from the Russian Federation and covered 48 billion euros of exportallance.
According to the European Commission, in 2023, almost a third of the Russian federal budget will be spent on defense and internal security.
Meanwhile, exports from the EU and imports from Russia have fallen by more than 50% compared to 2021. This provoked a particularly rapid decline in technologically dependent industries of the processing industry.
Exports of dual-use goods and advanced technologies were strong-78% in 2022 compared to 2019-2021.
Thanks to measures aimed at minimizing the impact on Member States, the influence of Nays was restrained, but it was noticeable in some areas mainly due to Russia's contractors and because of the war, which caused rising prices.
At the same time, the Russian Federation was able to obtain some sub -goods and other substittories from third countries, in particular from China, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the UAE, according to the report.

 The Ukrainian Defense Department has prepared the concept of transformation of sector.
About it in the author's column of the information agency "Interfax-Ukraine" wrote Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov.
“We started preparing for the formation of the Army of the Army of the Future a year ago - in 2022 I signed an order to carry out the inspection of the capacity of the Armored Forces of Ukraine. The assessment of the capabilities - that is, the balance of the challenges of the tarelny ability to answer them - is a basic element of defense planning on NATO principles. The review is completed. Based on the analysis of this material, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the experience of war, the Ministry of Defense prepared the concept of transformation of the Defense Sector of Ukraine. In early June, he submitted this document to the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denis Shmigal, ”the head of the Ukrainian Defense Office reported.
Alexei Reznikov emphasizes that much of the necessary decisions have an interagency character, requires changes to the legislation and concerns the competence of the mine, Ministry of Veterans, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Finance, and the like. Ensuring interagency synergies from the start is actually a success. The head of government pays special attention to it.
“On July 5, Prime Minister Denis Shmigal was presented on the implementation of the Security and Defense Sector Reform and Defense Reforms Program“ Ukrainian Shield », During which the colleagile is presented the vision of the Ministry of Defense regarding the necessary transformations. Posting with colleagues our joint proposals will become part of the discussion on Ukrainian doctrine , initiated by the President of Ukraine Volodymyrzelensky, ” - said Alexei Reznikov.
The Ukrainian Defense Minister insists: the enemy has proved that defense is a non -loss, and investments. The capable defense will generate resources.
“The strengthening of the Navy is a guarantee of safe navigation of the Soviet and Azov Seas, these are our income from trade. Inaccessible defense is a fuse against any recovery, a reliable guarantee of preserving the ruins. We have to prove the awareness of these ties in the decisions, ”Oleksireznikov explained.“We begin planning and design of defense transformations in the face of high degree of uncertainty. We know that the war will end in our way, but we do not know when for sure. This, for example, prevents the system optimization of the "zoo" of the weapon, which we repel the occupiers. Adengam needs all possible weapons, more and faster. We do not know when the decision of partners on the complete integration of our country is accurately addressed. And this is fundamentally. The reform of the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a part of collective defense is one thing. It is consistent with partner functional, capabilities, planned resources, access to information of tatechnology, etc. The formation of capabilities for defense alone with partial support support is another. That is why now one of my main requests for partners is that it is necessary to make a decision on Ukraine's accession as soon as possible. Then it will be easier for us and it is easier for us. Or, if we do not expect such a decision in the near future, Ukraine needs to include Ukraine's defense planning of Nadvich partners(many)third -party basis. Considering the high degree of uncertainty, a flexible flexible matrix of defensive transformations, which would allow to specify the magnification of the steps as it is moving, ”Alexei Reznikov summarized.
