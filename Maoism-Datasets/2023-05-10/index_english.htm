And what happened?!Only the Armed Forces of Ukraine can answer this question!</p>
<p>Of course, the propagandists of the Russian Federation filed this humiliation of the "Second Army of the World" as an alternation, so they represented the parade on May 9 only from the perspective: "The latest -body" Akhmat "and" Spartan "first participated in the Victory Parade."</p>

<p>“There are different positions on the volume of their production. For example, the data of the Western media with the Tadan of the Ukrainian Institute of the future are very different. I think that you can produce about 20, no more than 30 dummies a month. One of the leading experts of the tank -building, who was managed by Malyshev in Kharkiv, Vitaliy Nemilostiv said that he went to Uralvagonzavod before the war and by 2013 there was a rather powerful production, they received the latest machines, etc. And then the plant produced up to 120 dines a year. But now everything is accelerated, and it assumed that there could be a proceeding of more than 150 tanks. This is a very close figure, if you say the pronounced release of new tanks, ”Badrak said.</p>
<p>At the same time he noted that in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>There are a dozen armored car repair plants that are engaged in the restoration of old technology.</p>

<p>Answering questions about the quality of Russian equipment, Badrak stressed that they are significantly inferior to Western models.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, Russia is significantly losing the technologicality of all equipment - Andanka and other armored vehicles. There were reports that Russia was not enough for tank production for tanks, there are not enough bearings, etc., ”the expert said, adding that there are fewer foreign components in Russian equipment.</p>

<p>“It can be anticipated that such high -tech units and components of the urodia are gone. And that means that the tanks that Ukraine receives, such as Leopard orChalinger, I hope and Abrams we will get, and there is also information that we can get French Lesclerc - all this is much more powerful and more powerful than the Russian Federation tanks. Although hostile tanks will be more in number, ”Badrak stressed.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, on March 22 a group of investigators <a href="https://t.me/CITeam/3220"></a>She reported that the army of the Russian Federation displays the Starradian tanks of the T-54 and T-55, taken into service in 1946-they were noticed by Veshelona, which was transporting military equipment from the Far East.</p>

<p>This was announced today in Brussels during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of the Defense of the Union countries, the head of the Military Committee, Nathoadmiral Rob Bauer, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.</p>
<p>“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the aid miscalculations that Russia admitted - they were preparing for a three -day, "forgot" to inform performers about its goals and could not deploy a logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said NATO military director.</p>

<p>He noted that in the context of hostilities on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into logistics competitions, and this is what happens in Ukraine currently. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.</p>
<p>“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO Military Committee said.He confirmed that after the beginning of Russian aggression in Ukraine with certain logistics problems, allies on the Alliance were also faced, as they were not ready for such a large -scale war of high intensity.</p>
<p>“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be related to collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Bauer said.</p>

<p>He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.</p>
<p>In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europian -American General Christopher Cavola(Christopher Cavoli)He noted that it is not necessary to underestimate the Russian army.</p>
<p>“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”the US military commander said.</p>

In particular, the state service "Equation" was employed today. It is the support of people who need to repair the houses of the apquards after damaging war. Already this day we have a considerable amount of application "Action". In general, it is about hundreds of thousands of damaged objects. Moreover, we also have to work out this task as to those of our people who were able to force the damaged home. Equality in help is very important, the algorithm is needed. The next step is to compensate for the lost life. And it will be.</p>
<p>Of course, during the day I communicated with our commander, with intelligence executives. The situation on the forefront is the obvious first priority.</p>
<p>Today he has signed new decrees on the celebration of our warriors by state -owned.

<p>This was stated by the Senior Military Advisor of the UK delegation to the OSCE Janstabbs during a meeting of the Vienna Security Cooperation Forum, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"Last week, Russia again struck massive rocket strokes and blows from BLAPO settlements across Ukraine ... aimed at punishing the Ukrainian people the proliferation of terror. They are cruel acts of revenge and shameful manifestation of the Russian military leadership, "he said.</p>

<p>The British diplomat pointed out that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the attacks of Nazi and their homes, as well as large -scale atrocities, "destroy the memory of past sacrifices and once proud worldwide reputation of Russia."</p>
<p>"Europe has terrible memories of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s and 40s, a departed disdain for human life, cultural heritage, the territory of the smaller states. Moscow's actions today distort the memory of all those who fought against tyranny and paid the highest price, Believing that they will save the web generations from the disaster of war, "he added.</p>

<p>According to Stabbs, this year's celebration of Moscow Victory Day "emphasizes its invasion of Ukraine."</p>
<p>"The abolition of many military parades and passages of the" immortal regiment "of the longing of Russia indicates the gloomy reality of its enormous losses: except for many non -Ukrainian victims, thousands of young Russian men die in the name of Putin <strong> [] <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu"></a></strong>, leaving mothers without sons, wives without men, and children without parents, " - said the British diplomat.</p>

<p>"Russia must realize that it will never be able to win in Ukraine. If it continues to fight, then we will not lose.

<p>As Ukrinform reports, this is said <a href="https://www.president.lv/lv/jaunums/valsts-prezidenta-egila-levita-pazinojums"></a>.</p>
<p>Two political force coalitions - the New Unity Party and the national association support Levis re -nomination for the president. At the same time, the third -cobalial force of the Joint List and the Opposition Party "Latvia on the first place" supported another candidacy, it is stated in Levis's statement.</p>
<p>In this situation, according to him, the decisive role in the presidential election will be parties that "do not represent the Latvian and Western course <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-latvia"></a>”. Levitus states that he does not want to be elected with the support of such opposition parties.</p>
<p>“Re -election for the second term is not an end in itself. Taking into account the de facto coalition with the pro -Kremlian political forces associated with the ash, which is being formed now, I decided not to participate in the Presidential Elections on May 31, ”Levit said.</p>

<p>The NATO Headquarters said this during a press conference at the NATO headquarters, Admiral Rob Bauer, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Bauer said.</p>
<p>“Defense leaders of the Union countries have confirmed their constant support - there is no doubt that <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>It will support Ukraine for as long as it will be necessary, ”added NATO military committee.</p>
<p>He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.</p>
<p>“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to combine, adapt and protect, ”Bauer said.</p>

<p>Dmitry Chubenko, a spokesman for Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, informed in a comment to Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“In satisfaction of the prosecutor's request to the supreme <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-sud"></a>On April 13, Ukraine refused, the jurisdiction was not changed. The defense party prepares the same petition - about the change of utility from the Kyiv District Court of Poltava Naorjonikidzevsky District Court of Kharkiv, ”Chubenko said.</p>
<p>It is said that the proceedings can be sent to another court in exceptional cases and when otherwise it is impossible to ensure the execution of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>«Restoration of the territorial jurisdiction of court cases of the Ordzhonikidzevsky Regional Court in the sense of the provisions of Art. 34 of the CCP is not an exclusive case to send criminal proceedings to this court, ” - said a repair.</p>
<p>It is reported that 8 of the 9 witnesses and the defendant herself live in the Uzlovyansk, which does not belong to the jurisdiction of the Ordzhonikidzev Court, and such substances, such as the place of residence of the defenders and the group of prosecutors, are not grounds for sending the case to another court.</p>
<p>Concerning the consideration in the Kyiv District Court of Poltava, which was to begin Znul, the lawyers were sought for postponement of the meeting.</p>
<p>“The lawyers sent a request to the court to postpone the lawsuit in connection with the disease of the accused and the need to grant the time to prepare a petition of the Defense Party to the Supreme Court of Ukraine for change of utility. The court granted this request and postponed the preparatory meeting at 15:30 on June 7, ”Chubenko informed.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, Nelya Stepe was detained on July 11, 2014. Iy is accused of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the creation of a terrorist group. According to the prosecutor's office, Shtepa as a representative of the authorities knew about the terrorist organization "DNR", but did not use the law enforcement agencies to counteract the seizure of administrative buildings by terrorists and did not return to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the SBU to stabilize the situation.</p>

<p>She is threatened with life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After the arrest of the staff, she was in a pre -trial detention center for a long time, and later she was changed to house arrest, night arrest, and in early July 2021 it was released under personal obligation.</p>
<p>After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the territorial jurisdiction in the case was changed due to the inability to exercise justice during the military.</p>
<p>There were no court hearings for more than a year.</p>

<p>About it in <a href="http://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3707180-valentin-badrak-direktor-centru-doslidzen-armii-konversii-ta-rozzbroenna.html?fbclid=IwAR0zZSsc6Em2-aH2Q8t1-of6D3pmw04g-s3OAmier2kjEO_KE6-X0zn0pq0"></a>Ukrinform was stated by the Director of the Center for Army Research, Conversion and Disarmament Badrak.</p>
<p>“The commander of the US forces in Europe, General Kavolli says that Ukraine has received 98% of the weapon needed for the offensive. No, this is not the case, it is a blasphemous information, or cavalley tells about the weapon that has been announced. Therefore, we have not been lacked Leopard-1 tanks that are being repaired, we did not receive Abrams, which were actually promised to give us by the end of the year, perhaps they will give a little earlier-in the fall. Of course, all this will be needed, but in no way confirmations about the French tank Leclerc - the partners hinted at what we can give, and we can not give. But it is not just about tanks, a matter of successful rockets, in planes that should support the offensive. And long -range practitioners are not provided to us yet. And the reason, in my opinion, is that there is a non -STATE belief to support Ukraine in full de -occupation this year. It can happen in stages, wavy. That is, a certain amount of technique is provided, which will provide a successful first stage of the offensive - the achievement of the de -occupation of the territory of Ukraine at the level of February 24, 2022. And the Crimea and the Donbas are not talking about. And in the West, in my opinion, they think and look: if this is easily and quickly, then, in principle, you can support further, but if it chokes - then it is necessary to require the freezing of war, such as that Ukraine should be satisfied with the fact that Ukraine should be satisfied is. Now, we know that 17% of Ukraine is occupied, ”Badrak said.</p>

<p>He told about it in an interview with the German tabloid <a href="http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/ukraine-aussenminister-kuleba-ueber-selenskyj-toetung-wenn-die-russen-es-koennte-83861524.bild.html"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>"Do not consider this counter -offensive latter because we do not know what will come of it. And if this counter -offensive we manage to release our territories, then in the end you will tell you that it was the last, and if not, then we need to prepare for a complete counter -offensive" , - the diplomat said.</p>
<p>He emphasized the great role of Germany on the issue of providing the Armed Forces with the necessary weapon, because tactically, according to him, it all depends on the weapon, which Ukraine is as much as possible.</p>
<p>“Germany has a lot, and much depends on it. You have a very advanced arms with Rheinmetall as a kind of titanium of industry in Europe and possibly in the world. We need artillery ammunition, especially for long distances. We need armored vehicles, anti -aircraft complexes - all this in Germany is, and Germany can do even more, ”Kuleba said.</p>
<p>He joked that Germany was lucky that the F-16 is not a Leopard tanks, it is a non-Neniec technology, so the decision to transfer these fighters depends not on the FRN, but on the US, but Berlin could have a qualitative diplomacy of Washington.</p>
<p>Ukraine, the Minister added, is grateful for Miga, but this aircraft will not solve a problem. There are different types of fighters, but according to all the F-16 estimates it is the best.</p>
<p>"So let's focus on the F -16," Kuleba added.</p>

<p>The world, Europe should be interested not only in helping Ukraine to win this war -to -protect Europe, but also to replenish its own reserves.

<p>“This is the only way. Membership of Ukraine in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>It will not prevent this war during the war, but will protect from further war in the war, ”the Foreign Minister emphasized.</p>
<p>He does not see the prospects for negotiations with Moscow, Kyiv already had the experience of Zaporizhia of Germany and France from 2014 to 2022. Ukraine was advised to go here and there, but it did not work, he recalled. If Putin wanted a false peace, he would not start this war, the diplomat said.</p>
<p>He added that "if the Russians could kill the President of Zelensky, they would be precisely work."</p>

<p>This was stated by the director of the European Commission Foreign Tools Service Wagner during the seminar "Recovery of access to education: dialogue on the role of Ukrainian communities in repair, restoration and reconstruction" in Chernihiv, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>The European Commission Representative noted that, in his opinion, at this stage of renewal of access to education, the maximum cooperation with the state is "absolutely necessary", because the resolution of major strategic issues can begin only the national level.</p>
<p>"But now we are trying to organize pilot test projects, in particular here, because we think it is important not to miss the moment when we will need to move to decentralized implementation," Wagner said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-05-10T16-09-47-03-00/1683724027-609.jpg" />He added that it is not only about the crisis response, but of all the elements of the European Commission in Ukraine, in particular in the field of decentralization, which was one of the most successful reform projects in the period after Euromaidan.</p>
<p>“We combine decentralization with this great need to restore education and a magnificent number of needs that have now arisen. In our opinion, now for this potential, so we say: let's use the existing U -LEAD structure, because there are already partners who work throughout the country, ”said the director of the ECE.</p>
<p>According to him, European partners are now seeking to understand whether they will be able to quickly and successfully implement such projects that will allow children to return to <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-osvita"></a>, as well as to find out which ideas are really better to implement.</p>
<p>In this context, he noted that there are elements that are much better implemented at the local or regional level, which "the state does not understand."</p>
<p>According to Wagner, he looks forward to the moment when the schools begin to see at what level you can organize different parts of these pilot projects.He noted that European partners are generally interested in how much you need online.</p>

<p>The program for Ukraine for the expansion of rights and opportunities at the local level, accountability and development of "U-LEAD with Europe" is jointly funded by the EU and its states-members of Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmia, Estonia and Slovenia to support Ukraine on its way to strengthen local self-government.

If they lose at least 1,100 killed and more and more and have no sources of replenishment, as it was more than Russian prisons, it is clear that their infamous history will end there. And so the person who dreamed of some military-political personality, who dreamed that he would be Landlord and cut some lands of voculated territories, and in general to influence a lot, and here to require how to report why you could not achieve it and it To capture what he promised.

<p>The First Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine Taras Vysotsky told this during the first international non-GMO Summit "Strengthening Market Protection without GMOs"(International Non-GMO Summit), reports Ukrinform with a referral to <a href="https://minagro.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-dotrimuyetsya-yevropejskih-standartiv-z-viroshchuvannya-ne-gmo-soyi-taras-visockij"></a>.</p>
<p>“Agrarians continue to sow soybean - a vital culture for the supply of Bilk <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evropa"></a>. In 2022, more than 1.5 million hectares were harvested in Ukraine and 3.7 million tonnes of soybean were harvested, which is 7% more than 2021. Since the beginning of 2023, about 1 million Tutorial soybeans have already been exported to the EU, ”he said.</p>
<p>Vysotsky noted that Ukraine, as a candidate for entry into the EU, has been following the EU legislation. In particular, she joined the rules for counter -drilling forests. And since the end of 2024, some agricultural products, such as soybeans, will only be grown in lands where forests have not been cut down.</p>
<p>According to the Deputy Minister, last year about 658 thousand tons of soybean in Ukraine(17.5%of total production)was certified as a stable non-gmo soybean, according to the standards of the Danube Soybean Association. This guarantees the strictness of soybeans of EU norms to protect plants and reduce the emissions of parking gases.</p>
<p>"Such a significant result was achieved in connection with the implementation of the Program of the Protection Partnership, which is aimed at stimulating the sustainable production of non -gmo soybeans," Vysotsky emphasized.</p>
<p>He also said that the Ukrainian government has drafted a bill to strengthen the control, trade, import and export of GMO products, in accordance with EU law. The document provides for a strict punishment for violations of the law in the field of GMO management.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>It was possible by the end of 2022 to put the MIC on military rails. Moreover, there was a restart of the whole economy and the restructuring of the economy for a long -term war, "Badrak said.</p>
<p>One of the factors that the Kremlin succeeded, in his opinion, is that the western sanctions "acted in limited mode". "And confirmation of this Junior Package of Sanctions -for example, the EU has already been introduced for the tenth of the Chiconic Package. All this happened through the policycade to do everything gradually, step by step, and watch -it works or does not work," he explained.</p>

Badrak explained that it was about accelerating import substitution. In particular, the Urosian military equipment is increasingly components of Russian production using parts of civilian equipment.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning of 2023, our experts have been increasingly found in the technique of nodes of Russian production.</p>
<p>According to him, the second way is the search for components from partners. "Urally partners are different, such as China, which allows you to receive some complexing, microelectronics, etc. The second category of countries is countries that are imported to Russia. For example, Kazakhstan and Armenia are purchased by microelectronics and then it enters Russia. Again through governments - governments may not support such deliveries to Russia, but it is selected through private companies, civilian enterprises, " - said Badrak.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3696579-rosia-povernula-na-front-odnogo-z-vidstoronenih-generaliv-britanska-rozvidka.html"><strong> British </strong> <strong> Intelligence </strong></a>“Secondary sanctions, including the US, are effective. For example, India is afraid of secondary sanctions and therefore cannot agree on the issue of import from the Russian VCCSystem C-400 "Triumph" is a powerful SCR. The reason is that India refuses to consider dollars because it is afraid of sanctions, well, and Russia is disordering other currencies ... If secondary sanctions are imposed not only by the United States, but by the UEC, they will join other countries, then they will act powerfully, create a serious export control system re -export, ”Badrak says.</p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, on May 9, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Liaenn briefing in Kiev stated that the eleventh package of sanctions of the European Union will consist of the addition of import products and strengthening the fight against detour against Russia through imports to third countries or shadow structures.</p>

<p>The NATO Headquarters said this during a press conference at the NATO headquarters, Admiral Rob Bauer, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Bauer said.</p>
<p>“Defense leaders of the Union countries have confirmed their constant support - there is no doubt that <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>It will support Ukraine for as long as it will be necessary, ”added NATO military committee.</p>
<p>He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.</p>
<p>“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to combine, adapt and protect, ”Bauer said.</p>

<p>"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.</p>

<p>This was stated by the Senior Military Advisor of the UK delegation to the OSCE Janstabbs during a meeting of the Vienna Security Cooperation Forum, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"Last week, Russia again struck massive rocket strokes and blows from BLAPO settlements across Ukraine ... aimed at punishing the Ukrainian people the proliferation of terror. They are cruel acts of revenge and shameful manifestation of the Russian military leadership, "he said.</p>

<p>The British diplomat pointed out that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the attacks of Nazi and their homes, as well as large -scale atrocities, "destroy the memory of past sacrifices and once proud worldwide reputation of Russia."</p>
<p>"Europe has terrible memories of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s and 40s, a departed disdain for human life, cultural heritage, the territory of the smaller states. Moscow's actions today distort the memory of all those who fought against tyranny and paid the highest price, Believing that they will save the web generations from the disaster of war, "he added.</p>

<p>According to Stabbs, this year's celebration of Moscow Victory Day "emphasizes its invasion of Ukraine."</p>
<p>"The abolition of many military parades and passages of the" immortal regiment "of the longing of Russia indicates the gloomy reality of its enormous losses: except for many non -Ukrainian victims, thousands of young Russian men die in the name of Putin <strong> [] <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu"></a></strong>, leaving mothers without sons, wives without men, and children without parents, " - said the British diplomat.</p>

In particular, the state service "Equation" was employed today. It is the support of people who need to repair the houses of the apquards after damaging war. Already this day we have a considerable amount of application "Action". In general, it is about hundreds of thousands of damaged objects. Moreover, we also have to work out this task as to those of our people who were able to force the damaged home. Equality in help is very important, the algorithm is needed. The next step is to compensate for the lost life. And it will be.</p>
<p>Of course, during the day I communicated with our commander, with intelligence executives. The situation on the forefront is the obvious first priority.</p>
<p>Today he has signed new decrees on the celebration of our warriors by state -owned.

<p>“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the aid miscalculations that Russia admitted - they were preparing for a three -day, "forgot" to inform performers about its goals and could not deploy a logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said NATO military director.</p>

<p>He noted that in the context of hostilities on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into logistics competitions, and this is what happens in Ukraine currently. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.</p>
<p>“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO Military Committee said.He confirmed that after the beginning of Russian aggression in Ukraine with certain logistics problems, allies on the Alliance were also faced, as they were not ready for such a large -scale war of high intensity.</p>
<p>“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be related to collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Bauer said.</p>

<p>He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.</p>
<p>In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europian -American General Christopher Cavola(Christopher Cavoli)He noted that it is not necessary to underestimate the Russian army.</p>
<p>“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”the US military commander said.</p>

<li>The hostile TG channels wrote: "The Guardian today is a big article in which the wounded and injured military of the Armed Forces complain that they feel post-traumatic syndrome and at the same time absolutely no one in Ukraine is needed in Ukraine."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"In honor of the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany, on Victory Day, the United States announced their decision to allocate another $ 1.2 billion to help the Nazis in Ukraine," the American publicist Jackson Hinkle wrote on his Twitter page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TG hostile channels reported that The Washington Post allegedly summarized: “Some fears that if Ukrainians do not cope, Kiev may lose international military assistance or face new pressure to start negotiations with Moscow at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield . Such negotiations will almost certainly include Russia's requirements for the negotiating surrender of the sovereign territory. "</li>

Significant ammunition was delivered or headed to Ukraine. Thus, the second-hand, which we agreed last week, provides 1 billion euros of the European Peace Fund for purchase by member states of ammunition155 and 152 millimeters.

<p>In Russian telegrams, information was spreading that allegedly Ukrainian leisure people tried to attack Moscow.</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been repeated statements of public persons that our goal is military objects. The main danger of the Russians comes from their regime of the Tasil Bloc, they need to raise the worthless state of their passive population, which silently perceives propaganda, but we do not see the queues of their volunteers to replenish the "200" racists in Ukraine. Yesterday we saw a absolutely pathetic parade of "Victory", that is, without victory and without victory. They did not achieve their goals. Against this background, they have some fear when there is nothing to say and there is nothing to show, - a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Yusov said on the air of the Telebovina Telvarana.</li>
</ul>
<p>As he noted, the enemy always prepares several scenarios for implementation, one of the same is provocation against his own civilian population. In the modern Russian regime, there are forces that understand that in order to preserve its future Muscovy, it is necessary to fight in any way against Putin's regime, and there are now. For Russia, the perpetrators should be determined in advance and it is advisable to be ignored in them. So, Shoigu, Gerasimov and Prigogine are now identified - who will be guilty.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no rapid increase in the production of new precision rocket weapons of the place, and they are constantly looking for sanctions. However, references for sanctions and, in particular, compliance with the sanctions already adopted are that Ukraine and the International Coalition are constantly working, but a certain production, tens a month, still exists. At the same time, rocket weapons, such as C-300, which threatens the frontier territories, have stocks, although "daggers" and "calibra" are already on a critical border,-says Andrey Yusov.</li>

<p>This was stated by the President of the Czech Republic Peter Paul in Radio journal(https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/petr-pavel-ukrajina-protiletadlove-systemy-kub_2305101415_pj).</p>
<p>«Зараз на стадії поставки ще два комплекси ППО „Куб“ із відносно великоюкількістю ракет, які Україна може негайно використати, оскільки солдатинавчені такій техніці», — сказав Петр Павел.</p>
<p>Він також заявив про доцільність розглянути питання про надання Українічеських винищувачів L-159.</p>
<p>Президент Чеської Республіки визнав, що Україні потрібна авіація дляпідготовки до вирішальної фази війни.</p>
<p>Павел зауважив, що західні країни досі стримано постачали сучасні винищувачі,тому що підготовка до їх використання займає відносно тривалий час, а такожчерез те, що машини містять секретні системи. Країни-союзники до того ж нехочуть, щоб ці пристрої потрапили до рук росіі.</p>
<p>За словами Павела, переговори тривають, щодо надання Україні винищувачів F-16вирішальним фактором для України є забезпечення достатньою кількістюбронетехніки та боєприпасів. Цього не вистачає Україні, тому що вирішальнучастину битви доведеться проходити на землі, — зауважив ексгенерал НАТО.</p>
<p>Він нагадав, що Україна вже отримала від Чехії близько 100 танків, стільки жбронетехніки та багато боєприпасів.</p>
<p>Радянська система «Куб», яку за зовнішнім виглядом прозвали «три пальцісмерті», використовується для прицілювання літаків і вертольотів. На озброєннічеської армії її мають замінити ракетні комплекси SPYDER з Ізраїлю.</p>

<p>“The names of all who do it, we will probably receive after the victory. I will say this: these are forces that understand the danger of the Putin regime, in particular, in the territory of the Russian Federation, ”Andrey Yusov explained.</p>
<p>According to the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the specified forces are known information and objects of military logistics of the aggressor state, so the demilitarization of the mosque will continue.</p>
<p>"It will continue until Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine - in 1991, it will not issue military criminals and will not compensate for all -rounds," Andrey Yusov emphasized.</p>
<p>Among other things, the military intelligence officer of Ukraine evaluated the exacerbation of the conflict with the intersection of the so-called Vagner PEC Prigozhin with the leadership of the Army of the State-Agressor.</p>
<p>“Of course, this is not yet an armed confrontation, it has not gone into some nourishment, did not plant or killed anyone. But the conflict is gaining momentum. I think it would be difficult to imagine a few years ago that someone would allow the NAChis to the Minister of Defense and the Head of the General of the Generality .</p>
<p>At the same time, the representative of the GUR of the Mou of Ukraine stressed that the manifestation of the Skolylivsky confrontations can be not only in the verbal but also in the uniform form, such as the UAV attack on the Kremlin. Therefore, against the backdrop of the war, the bombing of the Voronezh, when Russian special services in the name of the regime are provocations against their population, will grow.</p>
<p>“The main threats to Moscow are actually in it: today tens of thousands of peered Russians, they were sent to death by Putin - and all claims to the Kremlin regime. The question is not to NATO and not to Ukraine, ”Andrei Yusov said.</p>
<p>During the interview, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence also discussed changes in the pro -propaganda narratives, which Muscovy is trying to justify the number of castitrophic consequences through the war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of mobilized are not easy to provide military psychologists because they have not been taught so many servicemen.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces followed several ways to decompose this issue.</p>
<p>And we have results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, NATO standards have created groups of psychologists to work with combat stress. * Also, on the basis of the military institute of the window, mobilized civilian psychologists under an intensive program are being prepared. * We have already launched and tested the pilot project of decompression of fighters who are on the front country.

More deficiency for our sky, more opportunities for our defense and the Movement. I held several meetings today, where we discussed it all. And we expect the corresponding steps from partners to the next time.</p>

He will not see nothing!We must return freedom, security and Europe to all Ukrainian land - all European land. We will do it!We will not leave the enemy of any shredded land - no tyranny will rule. And I thank the partner leaders, all the partner states, everyone and everyone who helps us to strengthen our power and make Ukrainian defense even more active.</p>

We are working out all the aspects of recovery, and each of them is in a new security form. Economics and industry, defense, energy, energy, infrastructure, educational industry, social sphere, medicine, in particular the rehabilitation component ... All that should be built, what is ready to invest in the world, what will give Ukraine and Ukrainians reliable protection and confident development .</p>
<p>Now, during May, we will refine the specific points of these state programs, and in June we will go for practical work with partners on our plans. The reconstruction here and now - critical systems and strategic transformation of our country. I am sure, our project will give impetus to development at least all our region - after Ukraine, and all our partners who will cooperate with Ukraine.</p>
<p>It is here, in Ukraine, that the world will see what Europe is capable of. Here, in Ukraine, in Ukraine, there will be a maximum of Europe in Europe - a maximum of the possible European values, which is capable of European and global cooperation.Of course, during the day I communicated with our commander, with intelligence executives. The situation on the forefront is the obvious first priority.</p>
<p>Today he has signed new decrees on the celebration of our warriors by state -owned. The 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade. 14th, 28, 53, 59-Tai 72 Separate mechanized brigades. 3rd Separate Storm Brigade. 27-Mareactive Artillery Brigade. 112th separate team TRO. 67th Separate Battalion. 65th Military Mobile Hospital. It is a Liman Wash, Bakhmut, Yar, Avdiivskyi, Shakhtarsky.</p>
<p>In total, today the decrees marked 266 of our defenders and defenders. The most echoed, the most worthy are those whose lives are the life of Ukraine, our wonderful art of indomitable Ukraine.</p>
<p>Glory to all our soldiers, who are now in battle, in combat posts and in combat operations!</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, this is discussed in the publication <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/10/wagner-russia-bakhmut-ukraine-00096255"></a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Ukrainian forces repelled several positions from the Russians on the outskirts of the city, but American officials said they did not see any evidence that militants are preparing for full exit from the city. The group owns significant ammunition and controls at least 85 percent of Bakhmut, noted.</p>

<p>It is noted that Prigogine has long criticized the management of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff for insufficient support of his group, and his statements about Bakhmut are not in confidence.</p>
<p>"We are not going to comment on Mr. Prigogine's theatrical performances or political outcome, which is observed between him and Russian military chiefs," said a spokesman for the US National Security Council. "Prigogine is treated as gun meat, sacrificing their lives for the sake of minor provisions without apparent strategic benefits and trying to achieve their political goals."</p>

<p>Recall that in the last week, Prigogine in a number of videos distributed by Usocial networks has declared its intention to completely remove its fighters from the city's alleged lack of weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, by combat actions in <strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bahmut"></a></strong> Cadirovka will be engaged. Later, Wagner was abandoned by these threats, stating that the Russian defense has promised him to send additional resources.</p>

<p>Bakhmut's fighting, which is one of the hottest sections of the Front of the Russian-Ukrainian War, has been in a dead end in recent weeks.</p>

<p>“Wages arrears in the Russian“ military-civil administration ”of the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhya region ranges from 1 to 2.5 months. The management of occupation administrations claims that the Moscowas are blocked in the Russian Treasury in connection with bureaucratic conversations. However, according to information from our underground, blocking the funds is at the level of decision in Moscow. The Russians decided not to pay the funds to the "administrations" due to the development of the situation at the front, " - said the Center for National Resistance.</p>
