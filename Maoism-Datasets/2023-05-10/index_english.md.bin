The State Security Service [reported](http://t.me/dsszzi_official/5790)Utegram.

It is noted that the use of "strong" passwords for bank applications, e-mail boxes, pages on social networks or any other accounts is one of the basic rules of cybergigiene, the observance of which helps to protect data from theft.

The State Secretariat has recalled that a reliable password should contain more than eight symbols: uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters.

It is effective to use pasphrase. It is a set of words encrypted by the user. For example, a line from a poem, a song in which the spaces are deleted, some literalized in numbers, special symbols, certain letters are translated into upper case.

A strong password can also be created using special passwords.

It is important for each account to have a separate, unique password.

If it is difficult to remember a lot of difficult passwords, you can use passwords - programs that serve as a "safe", allow you to keep your passwords safe with encryption. Passwords can be used on computers and smartphones. When choosing the best advantage of programs of well -known developers, before installing a product reputation, and to study safety reviews.

At the same time, the State Secretariat has warned from the use of simple words in passwords, common combinations of letters and words, symbols that are repeated or go one in the way.

"Combinations such as 123456, Qwerty, Password and the like are categorically bored, hackers break such passwords in less than a second," the service said.

You should not use your own name, last name, date of birth. The same applies to the names, names and any personal information of relatives.

“There are different positions on the volume of their production. For example, the data of the Western media with the Tadan of the Ukrainian Institute of the future are very different. I think that you can produce about 20, no more than 30 dummies a month. One of the leading experts of the tank -building, who was managed by Malyshev in Kharkiv, Vitaliy Nemilostiv said that he went to Uralvagonzavod before the war and by 2013 there was a rather powerful production, they received the latest machines, etc. And then the plant produced up to 120 dines a year. But now everything is accelerated, and it assumed that there could be a proceeding of more than 150 tanks. This is a very close figure, if you say the pronounced release of new tanks, ”Badrak said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-10T-33-34-00-03-00/630_360_1663444486-508.jpg)Initially, the invasion of Ukraine did not create a system of logistics, suffered heavy losses, and now forced to use obsolete equipment and untrained people in large number.

This was announced today in Brussels during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of the Defense of the Union countries, the head of the Military Committee, Nathoadmiral Rob Bauer, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.

“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the aid miscalculations that Russia admitted - they were preparing for a three -day, "forgot" to inform performers about its goals and could not deploy a logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said NATO military director.

He noted that in the context of hostilities on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into logistics competitions, and this is what happens in Ukraine currently. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.

“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO Military Committee said.He confirmed that after the beginning of Russian aggression in Ukraine with certain logistics problems, allies on the Alliance were also faced, as they were not ready for such a large -scale war of high intensity.

“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be related to collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Bauer said.

He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.

In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europian -American General Christopher Cavola(Christopher Cavoli)He noted that it is not necessary to underestimate the Russian army.

“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”the US military commander said.

Moreover, we also have to work out this task as to those of our people who were able to force the damaged home. Equality in help is very important, the algorithm is needed. The next step is to compensate for the lost life. And it will be.

This was stated by the Senior Military Advisor of the UK delegation to the OSCE Janstabbs during a meeting of the Vienna Security Cooperation Forum, Ukrinform reports.

"Last week, Russia again struck massive rocket strokes and blows from BLAPO settlements across Ukraine ... aimed at punishing the Ukrainian people the proliferation of terror. They are cruel acts of revenge and shameful manifestation of the Russian military leadership, "he said.

The British diplomat pointed out that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the attacks of Nazi and their homes, as well as large -scale atrocities, "destroy the memory of past sacrifices and once proud worldwide reputation of Russia."

"Europe has terrible memories of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s and 40s, a departed disdain for human life, cultural heritage, the territory of the smaller states. Moscow's actions today distort the memory of all those who fought against tyranny and paid the highest price, Believing that they will save the web generations from the disaster of war, "he added.

"The abolition of many military parades and passages of the" immortal regiment "of the longing of Russia indicates the gloomy reality of its enormous losses: except for many non -Ukrainian victims, thousands of young Russian men die in the name of Putin ** [] [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu)**, leaving mothers without sons, wives without men, and children without parents, " - said the British diplomat.

A British mission representative in the OSCE stressed that the Kremlin's non -consistent decisions "have a terrible influence on the Russian people - more meaningless deaths, more corbors, more defeats, more demoralized troops, more and more isolation."

"Russia must realize that it will never be able to win in Ukraine. If it continues to fight, then we will not lose. We are not underestimated in the struggle for the liberation of other parts of their father. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine will be fully restored. The United Kingdom and the international community will be adamant in their support - we will stand near Zamstina, no matter how time it takes, " - said the military adviser to the British delegation. .

In this situation, according to him, the decisive role in the presidential election will be parties that "do not represent the Latvian and Western course [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-latvia)”. Levitus states that he does not want to be elected with the support of such opposition parties.

“Re -election for the second term is not an end in itself. Taking into account the de facto coalition with the pro -Kremlian political forces associated with the ash, which is being formed now, I decided not to participate in the Presidential Elections on May 31, ”Levit said.

The NATO Headquarters said this during a press conference at the NATO headquarters, Admiral Rob Bauer, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Bauer said.

“Defense leaders of the Union countries have confirmed their constant support - there is no doubt that [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)It will support Ukraine for as long as it will be necessary, ”added NATO military committee.

He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.

“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to combine, adapt and protect, ”Bauer said.

Their commitment and determination are a clear signal to the potential aggressor - NATO will protect every inch.

"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.

It is known that the NATO Military Committee is the highest body of military administration of the hallias, which determines the needs of defense and development of the Armed Forces to ensure the collective defense of the Allies, to implement NATO political decisions.

«Restoration of the territorial jurisdiction of court cases of the Ordzhonikidzevsky Regional Court in the sense of the provisions of Art. 34 of the CCP is not an exclusive case to send criminal proceedings to this court, ” - said a repair.

It is reported that 8 of the 9 witnesses and the defendant herself live in the Uzlovyansk, which does not belong to the jurisdiction of the Ordzhonikidzev Court, and such substances, such as the place of residence of the defenders and the group of prosecutors, are not grounds for sending the case to another court.

Concerning the consideration in the Kyiv District Court of Poltava, which was to begin Znul, the lawyers were sought for postponement of the meeting.

“The lawyers sent a request to the court to postpone the lawsuit in connection with the disease of the accused and the need to grant the time to prepare a petition of the Defense Party to the Supreme Court of Ukraine for change of utility. The court granted this request and postponed the preparatory meeting at 15:30 on June 7, ”Chubenko informed.

As reported by Ukrinform, Nelya Stepe was detained on July 11, 2014. Iy is accused of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the creation of a terrorist group. According to the prosecutor's office, Shtepa as a representative of the authorities knew about the terrorist organization "DNR", but did not use the law enforcement agencies to counteract the seizure of administrative buildings by terrorists and did not return to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the SBU to stabilize the situation.

She is threatened with life imprisonment.

After the arrest of the staff, she was in a pre -trial detention center for a long time, and later she was changed to house arrest, night arrest, and in early July 2021 it was released under personal obligation.

After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the territorial jurisdiction in the case was changed due to the inability to exercise justice during the military.

There were no court hearings for more than a year.

About it in [](http://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3707180-valentin-badrak-direktor-centru-doslidzen-armii-konversii-ta-rozzbroenna.html?fbclid=IwAR0zZSsc6Em2-aH2Q8t1-of6D3pmw04g-s3OAmier2kjEO_KE6-X0zn0pq0)Ukrinform was stated by the Director of the Center for Army Research, Conversion and Disarmament Badrak.

“The commander of the US forces in Europe, General Kavolli says that Ukraine has received 98% of the weapon needed for the offensive. No, this is not the case, it is a blasphemous information, or cavalley tells about the weapon that has been announced. Therefore, we have not been lacked Leopard-1 tanks that are being repaired, we did not receive Abrams, which were actually promised to give us by the end of the year, perhaps they will give a little earlier-in the fall. Of course, all this will be needed, but in no way confirmations about the French tank Leclerc - the partners hinted at what we can give, and we can not give. But it is not just about tanks, a matter of successful rockets, in planes that should support the offensive. And long -range practitioners are not provided to us yet. And the reason, in my opinion, is that there is a non -STATE belief to support Ukraine in full de -occupation this year. It can happen in stages, wavy. That is, a certain amount of technique is provided, which will provide a successful first stage of the offensive - the achievement of the de -occupation of the territory of Ukraine at the level of February 24, 2022. And the Crimea and the Donbas are not talking about. And in the West, in my opinion, they think and look: if this is easily and quickly, then, in principle, you can support further, but if it chokes - then it is necessary to require the freezing of war, such as that Ukraine should be satisfied with the fact that Ukraine should be satisfied is. Now, we know that 17% of Ukraine is occupied, ”Badrak said.

He told about it in an interview with the German tabloid [](http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/ukraine-aussenminister-kuleba-ueber-selenskyj-toetung-wenn-die-russen-es-koennte-83861524.bild.html), reports Ukrinform.

"Do not consider this counter -offensive latter because we do not know what will come of it. And if this counter -offensive we manage to release our territories, then in the end you will tell you that it was the last, and if not, then we need to prepare for a complete counter -offensive" , - the diplomat said.

He emphasized the great role of Germany on the issue of providing the Armed Forces with the necessary weapon, because tactically, according to him, it all depends on the weapon, which Ukraine is as much as possible.

“Germany has a lot, and much depends on it. You have a very advanced arms with Rheinmetall as a kind of titanium of industry in Europe and possibly in the world. We need artillery ammunition, especially for long distances. We need armored vehicles, anti -aircraft complexes - all this in Germany is, and Germany can do even more, ”Kuleba said.

He joked that Germany was lucky that the F-16 is not a Leopard tanks, it is a non-Neniec technology, so the decision to transfer these fighters depends not on the FRN, but on the US, but Berlin could have a qualitative diplomacy of Washington.

Ukraine, the Minister added, is grateful for Miga, but this aircraft will not solve a problem. There are different types of fighters, but according to all the F-16 estimates it is the best.

"So let's focus on the F -16," Kuleba added.

“This is the only way. Membership of Ukraine in [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)It will not prevent this war during the war, but will protect from further war in the war, ”the Foreign Minister emphasized.

He does not see the prospects for negotiations with Moscow, Kyiv already had the experience of Zaporizhia of Germany and France from 2014 to 2022. Ukraine was advised to go here and there, but it did not work, he recalled. If Putin wanted a false peace, he would not start this war, the diplomat said.

This was stated by the director of the European Commission Foreign Tools Service Wagner during the seminar "Recovery of access to education: dialogue on the role of Ukrainian communities in repair, restoration and reconstruction" in Chernihiv, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

The European Commission Representative noted that, in his opinion, at this stage of renewal of access to education, the maximum cooperation with the state is "absolutely necessary", because the resolution of major strategic issues can begin only the national level.

"But now we are trying to organize pilot test projects, in particular here, because we think it is important not to miss the moment when we will need to move to decentralized implementation," Wagner said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-10T16-09-47-03-00/1683724027-609.jpg)He added that it is not only about the crisis response, but of all the elements of the European Commission in Ukraine, in particular in the field of decentralization, which was one of the most successful reform projects in the period after Euromaidan.

“We combine decentralization with this great need to restore education and a magnificent number of needs that have now arisen. In our opinion, now for this potential, so we say: let's use the existing U -LEAD structure, because there are already partners who work throughout the country, ”said the director of the ECE.

According to him, European partners are now seeking to understand whether they will be able to quickly and successfully implement such projects that will allow children to return to [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-osvita), as well as to find out which ideas are really better to implement.

In this context, he noted that there are elements that are much better implemented at the local or regional level, which "the state does not understand."

According to Wagner, he looks forward to the moment when the schools begin to see at what level you can organize different parts of these pilot projects.He noted that European partners are generally interested in how much you need online.

"Such a significant result was achieved in connection with the implementation of the Program of the Protection Partnership, which is aimed at stimulating the sustainable production of non -gmo soybeans," Vysotsky emphasized.

He also said that the Ukrainian government has drafted a bill to strengthen the control, trade, import and export of GMO products, in accordance with EU law. The document provides for a strict punishment for violations of the law in the field of GMO management.

One of the factors that the Kremlin succeeded, in his opinion, is that the western sanctions "acted in limited mode". "And confirmation of this Junior Package of Sanctions -for example, the EU has already been introduced for the tenth of the Chiconic Package.

"Since the beginning of 2023, our experts have been increasingly found in the technique of nodes of Russian production.

According to him, the second way is the search for components from partners. "Urally partners are different, such as China, which allows you to receive some complexing, microelectronics, etc. The second category of countries is countries that are imported to Russia.

He also stated the expediency of considering the issue of providing Ukrainian L-159 fighter jets.

The President of the Czech Republic has acknowledged that Ukraine needs aviation to prepare for the decisive phase of war.

Pavel noted that the Western countries have still supplied modern fighters because preparation for their use takes a relatively long time, as well as the fact that machines contain secret systems. The Union countries are also bad for these devices to get into the hands of Russia.

"But I know that the negotiations are ongoing, and let's be surprised if you eventually get several F-16, perhaps with the dismantled part of the equipment," he said.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-10T21-02-00-03-00/630_360_1499439744-5916.jpg)The heads of the Defense of the Union countries, which held a meeting today in the format of NATO military committee, identified the strategic directions of development of the Alliance's ability to confirm the adamant support of Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.

The NATO Headquarters said this during a press conference at the NATO headquarters, Admiral Rob Bauer, the Ukrinform correspondent reports.

"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Bauer said.

“Defense leaders of the Union countries have confirmed their constant support - there is no doubt that [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato)It will support Ukraine for as long as it will be necessary, ”added NATO military committee.

He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.

“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to combine, adapt and protect, ”Bauer said.

Their commitment and determination are a clear signal to the potential aggressor - NATO will protect every inch.

"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.

It is known that the NATO Military Committee is the highest body of military administration of the hallias, which determines the needs of defense and development of the Armed Forces to ensure the collective defense of the Allies, to implement NATO political decisions.

In this situation, according to him, the decisive role in the presidential election will be parties that "do not represent the Latvian and Western course [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-latvia)”. Levitus states that he does not want to be elected with the support of such opposition parties.

“Re -election for the second term is not an end in itself. Taking into account the de facto coalition with the pro -Kremlian political forces associated with the ash, which is being formed now, I decided not to participate in the Presidential Elections on May 31, ”Levit said.

The British diplomat pointed out that Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the attacks of Nazi and their homes, as well as large -scale atrocities, "destroy the memory of past sacrifices and once proud worldwide reputation of Russia."

"Europe has terrible memories of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s and 40s, a departed disdain for human life, cultural heritage, the territory of the smaller states. Moscow's actions today distort the memory of all those who fought against tyranny and paid the highest price, Believing that they will save the web generations from the disaster of war, "he added.

According to Stabbs, this year's celebration of Moscow Victory Day "emphasizes its invasion of Ukraine."

"The abolition of many military parades and passages of the" immortal regiment "of the longing of Russia indicates the gloomy reality of its enormous losses: except for many non -Ukrainian victims, thousands of young Russian men die in the name of Putin ** [] [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-vijna-z-rosieu)**, leaving mothers without sons, wives without men, and children without parents, " - said the British diplomat.

A British mission representative in the OSCE stressed that the Kremlin's non -consistent decisions "have a terrible influence on the Russian people - more meaningless deaths, more corbors, more defeats, more demoralized troops, more and more isolation."

"Russia must realize that it will never be able to win in Ukraine. If it continues to fight, then we will not lose. We are not underestimated in the struggle for the liberation of other parts of their father. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine will be fully restored. The United Kingdom and the international community will be adamant in their support - we will stand near Zamstina, no matter how time it takes, " - said the military adviser to the British delegation. .

Moreover, we also have to work out this task as to those of our people who were able to force the damaged home. Equality in help is very important, the algorithm is needed. The next step is to compensate for the lost life. And it will be.

Of course, during the day I communicated with our commander, with intelligence executives. The situation on the forefront is the obvious first priority.

Today he has signed new decrees on the celebration of our warriors by state -owned. The 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade. 14th, 28, 53, 59-Tai 72 Separate mechanized brigades. 3rd Separate Storm Brigade. 27-Mareactive Artillery Brigade. 112th separate team TRO. 67th Separate Battalion. 65th Military Mobile Hospital. It is a Liman Wash, Bakhmut, Yar, Avdiivskyi, Shakhtarsky.

In total, today the decrees marked 266 of our defenders and defenders. The most echoed, the most worthy are those whose lives are the life of Ukraine, our wonderful art of indomitable Ukraine.

Glory to all our soldiers, who are now in battle, in combat posts and in combat operations!

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-10T22-34-00-03-00/630_360_1663444486-508.jpg)Initially, the invasion of Ukraine did not create a system of logistics, suffered heavy losses, and now forced to use obsolete equipment and untrained people in large number.

This was announced today in Brussels during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of the Defense of the Union countries, the head of the Military Committee, Nathoadmiral Rob Bauer, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.

“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the aid miscalculations that Russia admitted - they were preparing for a three -day, "forgot" to inform performers about its goals and could not deploy a logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said NATO military director.

He noted that in the context of hostilities on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into logistics competitions, and this is what happens in Ukraine currently. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.

“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO Military Committee said.He confirmed that after the beginning of Russian aggression in Ukraine with certain logistics problems, allies on the Alliance were also faced, as they were not ready for such a large -scale war of high intensity.

“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be related to collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Bauer said.

He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.

In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europian -American General Christopher Cavola(Christopher Cavoli)He noted that it is not necessary to underestimate the Russian army.

“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”the US military commander said.

**Misinformation**

* The hostile TG channels wrote: "The Guardian today is a big article in which the wounded and injured military of the Armed Forces complain that they feel post-traumatic syndrome and at the same time absolutely no one in Ukraine is needed in Ukraine."

**Manipulation**

* "In honor of the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany, on Victory Day, the United States announced their decision to allocate another $ 1.2 billion to help the Nazis in Ukraine," the American publicist Jackson Hinkle wrote on his Twitter page.

**Manipulation**

* TG hostile channels reported that The Washington Post allegedly summarized: “Some fears that if Ukrainians do not cope, Kiev may lose international military assistance or face new pressure to start negotiations with Moscow at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield . Such negotiations will almost certainly include Russia's requirements for the negotiating surrender of the sovereign territory. "

Ursula von Der Lyen noted that “in this struggle, the European Union and its Member States stand side by side with Ukraine… The first task is to help providing the necessary ammunition to Ukraine. You know that we work in three directions. The fastest way is the immediate release of ammunition from the member states. We have allocated 1 billion euros, and that works. Significant ammunition was delivered or headed to Ukraine. Thus, the second-hand, which we agreed last week, provides 1 billion euros of the European Peace Fund for purchase by member states of ammunition155 and 152 millimeters.

They were the commander of one of the regiments of the DNR terrorist organization and two subordinates. Even before the large -scale invasion, they volunteered to the ranks of Russian invaders. There, the persons involved were part of the staff groups of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, where after the 24th February year participated in hostilities on the Southern Front.

After the capture of part of the Nikolaev area, the commander of the enemy regiment was appointed "military commandant" in one of the villages of Bashtansky district. Rashists were abandoned by the locals and used torture to them.

It is documented that the attackers illegally detained four residents of the village, including former military personnel of the Armed Forces. The invaders were closed by the victims in a cold utility room and a cellar of the homeless air.

In the reserves of people, they were brutally beaten and kept in unsanitary interviews for a long time, without water and food.

In this way, the racists tried to persuade the victims to cooperate and get information about the places of defense forces.

On the basis of the evidence collected, investigators of the Security Service informed three defendants about suspicion of state treason, collaborative activity and violation of the laws of war.

Investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of crimes and prosecution.

In Russian telegrams, information was spreading that allegedly Ukrainian leisure people tried to attack Moscow.

- There have been repeated statements of public persons that our goal is military objects. The main danger of the Russians comes from their regime of the Tasil Bloc, they need to raise the worthless state of their passive population, which silently perceives propaganda, but we do not see the queues of their volunteers to replenish the "200" racists in Ukraine. Yesterday we saw a absolutely pathetic parade of "Victory", that is, without victory and without victory. They did not achieve their goals. Against this background, they have some fear when there is nothing to say and there is nothing to show, - a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Yusov said on the air of the Telebovina Telvarana.

As he noted, the enemy always prepares several scenarios for implementation, one of the same is provocation against his own civilian population. In the modern Russian regime, there are forces that understand that in order to preserve its future Muscovy, it is necessary to fight in any way against Putin's regime, and there are now. For Russia, the perpetrators should be determined in advance and it is advisable to be ignored in them. So, Shoigu, Gerasimov and Prigogine are now identified - who will be guilty.

- There is no rapid increase in the production of new precision rocket weapons of the place, and they are constantly looking for sanctions. However, references for sanctions and, in particular, compliance with the sanctions already adopted are that Ukraine and the International Coalition are constantly working, but a certain production, tens a month, still exists. At the same time, rocket weapons, such as C-300, which threatens the frontier territories, have stocks, although "daggers" and "calibra" are already on a critical border,-says Andrey Yusov.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-10T90-00-00-04-00/fvxkx30waai7mz2.jpg)The Czech Republic will hand over two systems of air defense "CUB" and the correspondence.

This was stated by the President of the Czech Republic Peter Paul in Radio journal(https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/petr-pavel-ukrajina-protiletadlove-systemy-kub_2305101415_pj).

«Зараз на стадії поставки ще два комплекси ППО „Куб“ із відносно великоюкількістю ракет, які Україна може негайно використати, оскільки солдатинавчені такій техніці», — сказав Петр Павел.

Він також заявив про доцільність розглянути питання про надання Українічеських винищувачів L-159.

Президент Чеської Республіки визнав, що Україні потрібна авіація дляпідготовки до вирішальної фази війни.

Павел зауважив, що західні країни досі стримано постачали сучасні винищувачі,тому що підготовка до їх використання займає відносно тривалий час, а такожчерез те, що машини містять секретні системи. Країни-союзники до того ж нехочуть, щоб ці пристрої потрапили до рук росіі.

За словами Павела, переговори тривають, щодо надання Україні винищувачів F-16вирішальним фактором для України є забезпечення достатньою кількістюбронетехніки та боєприпасів. Цього не вистачає Україні, тому що вирішальнучастину битви доведеться проходити на землі, — зауважив ексгенерал НАТО.

Він нагадав, що Україна вже отримала від Чехії близько 100 танків, стільки жбронетехніки та багато боєприпасів.

Радянська система «Куб», яку за зовнішнім виглядом прозвали «три пальцісмерті», використовується для прицілювання літаків і вертольотів. На озброєннічеської армії її мають замінити ракетні комплекси SPYDER з Ізраїлю.

“The names of all who do it, we will probably receive after the victory. I will say this: these are forces that understand the danger of the Putin regime, in particular, in the territory of the Russian Federation, ”Andrey Yusov explained.

According to the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the specified forces are known information and objects of military logistics of the aggressor state, so the demilitarization of the mosque will continue.

"It will continue until Russia withdraw its troops from Ukraine - in 1991, it will not issue military criminals and will not compensate for all -rounds," Andrey Yusov emphasized.

Among other things, the military intelligence officer of Ukraine evaluated the exacerbation of the conflict with the intersection of the so-called Vagner PEC Prigozhin with the leadership of the Army of the State-Agressor.

“Of course, this is not yet an armed confrontation, it has not gone into some nourishment, did not plant or killed anyone. But the conflict is gaining momentum. I think it would be difficult to imagine a few years ago that someone would allow the NAChis to the Minister of Defense and the Head of the General of the Generality .

At the same time, the representative of the GUR of the Mou of Ukraine stressed that the manifestation of the Skolylivsky confrontations can be not only in the verbal but also in the uniform form, such as the UAV attack on the Kremlin. Therefore, against the backdrop of the war, the bombing of the Voronezh, when Russian special services in the name of the regime are provocations against their population, will grow.

“The main threats to Moscow are actually in it: today tens of thousands of peered Russians, they were sent to death by Putin - and all claims to the Kremlin regime. The question is not to NATO and not to Ukraine, ”Andrei Yusov said.

During the interview, a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence also discussed changes in the pro -propaganda narratives, which Muscovy is trying to justify the number of castitrophic consequences through the war against Ukraine.

The front is a test on the verge of capabilities of the human body - both physically and psychologically.

Our warriors and their human capabilities in the truest sense ensure the consciousness of the state. Supporting the physical and mental health of the fighters is our priority.

Hundreds of thousands of mobilized are not easy to provide military psychologists because they have not been taught so many servicemen.

Therefore, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces followed several ways to decompose this issue.

And we have results:

* Today, NATO standards have created groups of psychologists to work with combat stress. * Also, on the basis of the military institute of the window, mobilized civilian psychologists under an intensive program are being prepared. * We have already launched and tested the pilot project of decompression of fighters who are on the front country.

Now, during May, we will refine the specific points of these state programs, and in June we will go for practical work with partners on our plans. The reconstruction here and now - critical systems and strategic transformation of our country. I am sure, our project will give impetus to development at least all our region - after Ukraine, and all our partners who will cooperate with Ukraine.

It is here, in Ukraine, that the world will see what Europe is capable of. Here, in Ukraine, in Ukraine, there will be a maximum of Europe in Europe - a maximum of the possible European values, which is capable of European and global cooperation.Of course, during the day I communicated with our commander, with intelligence executives. The situation on the forefront is the obvious first priority.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-11T00-35-00-03-00/630_360_1675531805-640.jpg)The Russian Wagner Groups continue to keep most of Bakhmut, and they will be largely reserves of ammunition, despite the losses and public statements of Eugene Prigogin.

According to Ukrinform, this is discussed in the publication [](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/10/wagner-russia-bakhmut-ukraine-00096255).

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian forces repelled several positions from the Russians on the outskirts of the city, but American officials said they did not see any evidence that militants are preparing for full exit from the city. The group owns significant ammunition and controls at least 85 percent of Bakhmut, noted.

It is noted that Prigogine has long criticized the management of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff for insufficient support of his group, and his statements about Bakhmut are not in confidence.

"We are not going to comment on Mr. Prigogine's theatrical performances or political outcome, which is observed between him and Russian military chiefs," said a spokesman for the US National Security Council. "Prigogine is treated as gun meat, sacrificing their lives for the sake of minor provisions without apparent strategic benefits and trying to achieve their political goals."

Recall that in the last week, Prigogine in a number of videos distributed by Usocial networks has declared its intention to completely remove its fighters from the city's alleged lack of weapons and ammunition.

Instead, he said, by combat actions in ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bahmut)** Cadirovka will be engaged. Later, Wagner was abandoned by these threats, stating that the Russian defense has promised him to send additional resources.

Bakhmut's fighting, which is one of the hottest sections of the Front of the Russian-Ukrainian War, has been in a dead end in recent weeks.

“Wages arrears in the Russian“ military-civil administration ”of the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhya region ranges from 1 to 2.5 months. The management of occupation administrations claims that the Moscowas are blocked in the Russian Treasury in connection with bureaucratic conversations. However, according to information from our underground, blocking the funds is at the level of decision in Moscow. The Russians decided not to pay the funds to the "administrations" due to the development of the situation at the front, " - said the Center for National Resistance.
