 Center for combating misinformation(CPD)at the NSDC of Ukraine informs that the main narrative that was promoted by Russian media yesterday is "Russia is a unique weapon that it is able to destroy any enemy."
The Secretary of the Council also added that the opinions of American politicians that the RFNA preventive US nuclear stroke will no longer be able to answer, is a short -sighted unexpected stupidity.
The Kremlin systematically threatens the event, often broadcasting nuclear narratives through Medvedev. He regularly voices Putin's thoughts and threats to the civilized world.
Nuclear intimidation, as well as statements about a unique weapon capable of destroying anyone, spread against the background of the failures of the invaders on the battlefield.
The Kremlin understands that they need to "feed" their population by regular trainees, but when they are not present - blackmail, threats and patients in propagandists, which are also loved by the depressed Russians.

A similar case happened on March 25, to execute the order refused the personal composition of the enemy intelligence company, which operates in the Avdeevsky direction.
The enemy continues to cynically use the medical institutions of the temporarily -occupied territories for their own purposes.

The enemy continues to concentrate his greatest offensive capabilities of the Nabakhmut direction. In parallel, they accumulate and all their media efforts of the topic of battles for Bakhmut. Actually, the information and psychological attachment of hostilities looks.
About it wrote Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in Telegrams.
The enemy is currently working out a medium three tasks:
To do this, they try to shift the accents in the topic of Bakhmut and to eliminate what our advantage is a reasonable and competent planning of operations. The displaced accent is to consider Bakhmut as an apocalyptic event and to do the division of the realist "before" and "after".
This psychological trick is used to suggest the desired ideas of the enemy's inarets. When society perceives battles in Bakhmut as a factor that will affect the course of the war in a whole way, it enables the enemy to promote Winfopol's scenarios for them.
Excessively wounded by the approach of the "end" frightened society at the plan of the enemy to start pressing on the military-political leadership on the cessation of defense.
This is in the pure form of IPSO in order to influence military decisions.
What messages are now using the enemy:
What are the two names infinitely exploited in Russian IPSO on Bakhmut:
In order to undermine confidence in them and make a conflict in the military leadership of the state. After all, Russian touches do not write that military decisions are made by kind. There is a military command headed by the Commander -in -Chief of the Danachian of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. In addition, he constantly meets the pond of the commander -in -chief, which also makes operational decisions with the participation of all the warring law enforcement agencies.
So what really happens and how should I take information about the fighting of Ubakhmuti? 
It is an active phase of war. As active as in other directions in the east, January 2023 is the large -scale enemy's offensive.The defense of Bakhmut is currently due to the operational-tactical feasibility, and the decisions are approved by competent, thoughtful and aimed at the implementation of current defense tins.
What can be defensive tasks:
Bakhmut will be defended as long as we need it from the point of consciousness of military defense problems. And this is our military command, and the non -Russian IPSO will still determine the defense of Bakhmut.
And the most unpleasant information for the enemy. Bakhmut fighting is not apocalypse. This is one heroic page of a powerful Ukrainian army in the war against Russian federation.

In the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine there are problems with receiving a civilian population.
About it reported Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.
“This is due to the fact that the Russian occupation command expands the practicing of local medical institutions for the treatment of exclusively Russian servicemen. As a result of such actions, the residents are deprived of even emergency medical care, ”she wrote.
In particular, last week, in the settlement of Novovasylivka, Zaporizhzhya region, a hospital was re -profiled into a Russian military hospital, in which more than 200 wounded occupiers were placed. At the instructions of the command of the enemy, to dispose of medical assistance to civilian population in this medical facility is prohibited.
In addition, in hospitals that still serve local residents, the number of qualified medical staff is critical, because the Russian occupation administrations forcibly send civilians to the treatment of wounded Russian military personnel, the number of which increases.

This was stated(https://t.me/militarymediacenter/1559)Military Media Center.

Oleksandr Kiago noted that the current Ukrainian-Russian war is not just about the struggle of two armies and two peoples. This is, first and foremost, the struggle of two -absolutely different worldviews.
“When considering officers as candidates for leadership positions, I never focused on a person's age, political preferences or personal sympathies or dislike. When the war of such a scale, it is important that the local commanders are becoming personalities and professionals who will be able to take responsibility and make decisions at a critical moment. Because inactivity is criminal, it will cost people life that is of the highest value to us, ”the management said.

For the last one and a half or two months, Putin and all the Russian steps are taking steps to sit at the negotiating table and stop there, as well. "
In addition, he said, a self -proclaimed President of Belarus, who is actually -book in Russia - Alexander Lukashenko - realizes that in the case of giving such a permit, he "will be" at great danger ".

 - I am really grateful to the representatives of the France's media, who are cheering for Ukraine to give positive news, which, unfortunately, are not yet true. This is such a good materialization of ideas, but I cannot confirm that the miraage has been transferred to Ukraine or today we are mastering them, - said Ukraine Ministry Alexei Reznikov during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine –Desa.
He also explained that Miraage has the same technical capabilities as the Mig-29-29 flowering forces, that is, it is able to detect 60 km air goals and affect them at a distance of 30 km. Instead, the enemy, for example, Su-35, is able to detect targets at a distance of 200 km and strike targets at a distance of more than 140 km.
-So let's get realists that we will be satisfied with any aviation platforms, but the main combat aircraft must probably be more modern, with the possibility of "see" more than 200 kilometers and hit more than 150 and more kilometers,-Alexei Reznikov emphasized.
The discussion with partners as to which combat aircraft will appear in Ukraine will be continued.

About it wrote In the telegram, Deputy Ministers of Ukraine Anna Malyar.
“One of the main tasks of the belligerent side is the destruction of the enemy's physical force.
But the loss of the enemy is many times more.
This is despite the fact that they have the advantage of the number of personnel and weapons.
The losses were greater in 2014-2015, but now that factor is almost twice in our favor.
We have such days in the East, when the ratio of killed reaches 1 to 10.
This is, of course, not daily, and the average coefficient is lower, but less, ”Anna Malyar said.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking on a video for a nationwide session of the second summit for democracy organized by Presidential Sysh Joseph Biden, called for participants to preserve respect for democracy in Ukraine, where freedom has not yet won.

According to the Head of State, Russia has long been fighting with many democracies of the world, connecting mechanisms of misinformation, corruption, election interference, espionage, cybercrime, and now efforts to provoke a global energy crisis.
“The enemies of freedom have not lost any year in recent decades. They sprayed all their time and unlimited funds for weakening, depressing and underwriting. But were all the efforts of the free world aimed at limiting the aggressive potential of tyrants and bringing them to legal responsibility? Unfortunately no. We have to fix it, ”Vladimirzelensky said.
He stressed that "democracy should learn to be uncompromising in front of hypocrisy."
"First, we do not need to think about how to keep Putin's face ... We have to think, however, how to maintain respect for democracy in countries where freedom has still invalid," the President said.
Secondly, according to the Head of State, democracy must have a weapon that has been guaranteed by the aggressor's defeat.
He also called on the summit participants to intensify the process of freezing the Russian "rich" assets, as they must have a motive for the name of freedom and put an end to the aggression and terrorist rule of the Kremlin.
In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called an unpleasant situation in which the adoption of sanctions against Russia is much slower than Russian agression itself.
“When our fighters reflect the storms under Bakhmut, they cannot wait for the Aartillery and shells for weeks. The fire should be immediate to neutralize the threat. All our decisions must be as fast. Democracy needs victory. This year, no later than we can provide it. Ukraine and everyone who helps. But you need to act faster, ”the President summarized.

“… We are in one city(in Belarus - note.). Тут тоже мутки мутять… Їздять напровокації… Короче, з цього боку провокують українців, щоб вони, типу, набілорусь напали… Ну, щоб підключились, напевне. Нас тисячі півтори тутприїхало», — розповідає він.
А його співрозмовник у цей час воює на Донецькому напрямку і чекає, щопідрозділ товариша перекинуть на підмогу саме сюди. Однак той спростовує:«…знову переїжджаємо з місця на місце. Кожного дня переїзд!По всій білорусіуже побували. Ми були в одному місті, зараз на кордоні з Польщею переїхали.Біля Польщі».
Такі дії свідчать про те, що рф не припиняє спроб втягнути білорусьбезпосередньо у війну проти України і робить це будь-якими способами.
