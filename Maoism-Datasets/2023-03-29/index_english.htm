The head of the united press center of defense of southern Ukraine Natalia Humeniuk, the head of the united news, said the head of the united news. According to the spicker, this is felt on the state of the ship composition of the Russians - it is reduced to 7 units in the Black Sea, in particular one underwater rocket launcher with quadrmarkets of the Caliber type, and one - in Azov.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is actually a designation of the presence of force, and indicates that the missile is impaired, but it will not be massive. Most likely, spotting will be used. We are currently put on aviation - according to the analysis of the previous two days we see that the enemy has intensified its use in the southern direction. Two attacks have taken place with the use of managed aviation bombs for the past, but it was also effective. For the Russians, this is a new stage in the management - managed aviation bombs, in particular in the southern direction, they did not apply, - said Humeniuk.</li>

A similar case happened on March 25, to execute the order refused the personal composition of the enemy intelligence company, which operates in the Avdeevsky direction.</p>
<p>The enemy continues to cynically use the medical institutions of the temporarily -occupied territories for their own purposes. Thus, the local hospital of the Belovodsk Luhansk region is equipped under a military hospital for 200 beds. Naragies in a medical institution treat the occupiers who have slight injuries. At the same time, all civilians are "discharged".</p>

<p>The enemy continues to concentrate his greatest offensive capabilities of the Nabakhmut direction. In parallel, they accumulate and all their media efforts of the topic of battles for Bakhmut. Actually, the information and psychological attachment of hostilities looks.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/600">wrote</a>Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar in Telegrams.</p>
<p>The enemy is currently working out a medium three tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>undermine the trust of our society and military in Bakhmut command; * Demotivation and psychologically weaken our army; * provoke our military leadership for erroneous actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, they try to shift the accents in the topic of Bakhmut and to eliminate what our advantage is a reasonable and competent planning of operations. The displaced accent is to consider Bakhmut as an apocalyptic event and to do the division of the realist "before" and "after".</p>
<p>This psychological trick is used to suggest the desired ideas of the enemy's inarets. When society perceives battles in Bakhmut as a factor that will affect the course of the war in a whole way, it enables the enemy to promote Winfopol's scenarios for them.</p>
<p>Excessively wounded by the approach of the "end" frightened society at the plan of the enemy to start pressing on the military-political leadership on the cessation of defense.</p>
<p>This is in the pure form of IPSO in order to influence military decisions.</p>
<p>What messages are now using the enemy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allegedly decision to keep Bakhmut political; * It seems like Bakhmut does not make sense, almost everything is surrounded; * Allegedly, the heroism of Ukrainian fighters is inflamed by Ukrainian propaganda.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the two names infinitely exploited in Russian IPSO on Bakhmut:</p>
<ul>
<li>President of Ukraine; * Commander-General of Colonel Alexander Sirsky.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to undermine confidence in them and make a conflict in the military leadership of the state. After all, Russian touches do not write that military decisions are made by kind. There is a military command headed by the Commander -in -Chief of the Danachian of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. In addition, he constantly meets the pond of the commander -in -chief, which also makes operational decisions with the participation of all the warring law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><strong> So what really happens and how should I take information about the fighting of Ubakhmuti? </strong></p>
<p>It is an active phase of war. As active as in other directions in the east, January 2023 is the large -scale enemy's offensive.The defense of Bakhmut is currently due to the operational-tactical feasibility, and the decisions are approved by competent, thoughtful and aimed at the implementation of current defense tins.</p>
<p>What can be defensive tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintenance of occupied borders and positions; * preventing the enemy's promotion deep into the territory; * Consideration of significant losses; * Creating conditions for a counter -offensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bakhmut will be defended as long as we need it from the point of consciousness of military defense problems. And this is our military command, and the non -Russian IPSO will still determine the defense of Bakhmut.</p>
<p><strong> And the most unpleasant information for the enemy. </strong> Bakhmut fighting is not apocalypse. This is one heroic page of a powerful Ukrainian army in the war against Russian federation.</p>

<p>In the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine there are problems with receiving a civilian population.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/601">reported</a>Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.</p>
<p>“This is due to the fact that the Russian occupation command expands the practicing of local medical institutions for the treatment of exclusively Russian servicemen. As a result of such actions, the residents are deprived of even emergency medical care, ”she wrote.</p>
<p>In particular, last week, in the settlement of Novovasylivka, Zaporizhzhya region, a hospital was re -profiled into a Russian military hospital, in which more than 200 wounded occupiers were placed. At the instructions of the command of the enemy, to dispose of medical assistance to civilian population in this medical facility is prohibited.</p>
<p>In addition, in hospitals that still serve local residents, the number of qualified medical staff is critical, because the Russian occupation administrations forcibly send civilians to the treatment of wounded Russian military personnel, the number of which increases.</p>

<p>Oleksandr Kiago noted that the current Ukrainian-Russian war is not just about the struggle of two armies and two peoples. This is, first and foremost, the struggle of two -absolutely different worldviews.</p>
<p>“When considering officers as candidates for leadership positions, I never focused on a person's age, political preferences or personal sympathies or dislike. When the war of such a scale, it is important that the local commanders are becoming personalities and professionals who will be able to take responsibility and make decisions at a critical moment. Because inactivity is criminal, it will cost people life that is of the highest value to us, ”the management said.</p>

This is such a good materialization of ideas, but I cannot confirm that the miraage has been transferred to Ukraine or today we are mastering them, - said Ukraine Ministry Alexei Reznikov during a briefing at the Media Center Ukraine –Desa.</p>
<p>He also explained that Miraage has the same technical capabilities as the Mig-29-29 flowering forces, that is, it is able to detect 60 km air goals and affect them at a distance of 30 km. Instead, the enemy, for example, Su-35, is able to detect targets at a distance of 200 km and strike targets at a distance of more than 140 km.</p>
<p>-So let's get realists that we will be satisfied with any aviation platforms, but the main combat aircraft must probably be more modern, with the possibility of "see" more than 200 kilometers and hit more than 150 and more kilometers,-Alexei Reznikov emphasized.</p>
<p>The discussion with partners as to which combat aircraft will appear in Ukraine will be continued.</p>

<ul>
<li>We support you from the beginning and will continue as long as it takes. You have been fighting with a brutal Russian aggressor for over a year, and of course you will defeat. You have shown everyone that bold leadership has secured Ukrainian success in this struggle. We also provide a humanitarian aid to refugees from Ukraine who are currently in Croatia. And let's not stop this, Croatia will continue to help in different ways. We will also make it because of all available mechanisms in the EU, - he assured.</li>

<ul>
<li>Terrible Russian war crimes are unacceptable. Therefore, Croatia is supporting the international court. All of Europe should be aware that Russian missiles that have fallen in Ukraine have fallen not so far from our homes. Russian aggression and Russian influence have the effect of safety, as well as on economic confidence in Europe. This is especially noticeable in the countries in the south of Europe, which are Croatia's Jewis. That is why the support of Ukraine and the condemnation of Russian inexpensive and uncontrollable aggression goes abroad of your country. The year is about the desire for stability and peace throughout Europe. So you can divide on the Croatian government, - said the Minister of Defense of Croatia.</li>

After all, under the international humanitarian law of the wounded, the wicked, they must be returned immediately and certainly, that is, to carry out unchanging, and repatriation.
