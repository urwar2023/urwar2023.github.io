** Dear Ukrainians!**

We complete this very difficult, but very important week. On Friday - Ligaarabian states. Saturday and Sunday - G7 plus Ukraine and the extended format - seven plus partners, including the global south, plus Ukraine. Intensively.

The world hears our position. The protection and guarantees of security, the return of all our territories, all our people, justice, the realization of our formula of peace ... As for every significant point for Ukraine, we have an understanding with the world. And together we will increase Ukrainian potential.

This Saturday is the Day of Science in Ukraine, and the more we give Ukraine, the more we give to all who work in this noble sphere. I congratulate all scientists!

Today, on Sunday, here, in Hiroshima, Ukraine was a truly honorary participant in the Great Seven. Ukrainian topics - central, honor to all Ukrainians - special. Thank you "Seven"!

Meeting with President Biden - and, as always, we become stronger after such intervals. Meeting with Indonesia leader is meaningful. Meeting with Korea Presidential Republic is a potential for a strong relationship. Meeting with Canada Trudeau Prime Minister-thank you, Justin, you. He talked to leaders and Australia. Separately and in detail with the Prime Minister of Japan-let's increase cooperation.

There was also a very important ceremony and appeal to the Museum of Peace in Hiroshima ...

Our unity with the world, our protection for Ukrainians and our power - the power of the Ukrainian state - will also be the most worthy commemoration of the memory of our people - different generations - whose life has been broken and trampled by the Russian gap, this long -term tyranny, which changes shapes but kills the equivalent.

Today is the Day of Remembrance of Victims of Political Repression ... The Day of Remembrance of All who have been in the Soviet regime. We do not forget what was, we do not forget, weaken, and do not forget that we are obliged to be strong.

And we will always.

**Glory to Ukraine!**

He told about it in an interview [](https://ukrainian.voanews.com/a/anomna-stancija-chekaje-na-deokupaciju/7101825.html)Petro Kotin, the President of the Ukrainian Energoatom, Operator of the ZEP, reports.

“Staff just in constant hope that is(de -occupation - ed.)Finally, and just waits and asks for help, ”Kotin said.

According to him, "the level of madness in these invaders is different." The official is afraid of their intentions and plans, since there are many nuclear materials at the station - six atomic units, six reactors filled with fuel, nuclear fuel. In addition, there are six filled fuel pools, each next to the reactor. In their damage, radiation is possible.

Depending on the scale of the damage, local contamination may be detached - the "Chernobyl scale or the size of Fukushima". And then it will be more dependent on the weather conditions and the direction of the wind, which will spread the contamination, warns Kotin.

For example, the release of VO plant. Observers are also present at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant.

He also supported the idea of Grossi about the freestyle -free military territory. Negotiations are ongoing, but there is no decision. The plan of Grososidl Zese was to "protect the object, not the territory", and withdraw the weapons from the station.

However, Kotin is hopeful for the release of hostages of Veenergodar and counteracting the danger from the Russians from potential catastrophic pollination of Europe. In addition, he puts hopes on a "true personnelset". "They, of course, support Russian troops, but some of them are professional nuclearists, and they understand the risks," Kotin added.

He also said that since the occupation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant there were six shutdowns, which is very dangerous for the station. "It is like the first stage that happened on Fukushima," Kotin compared.He is also [](https://ukrainian.voanews.com/a/kotin-interview-zaes-anomna-energia/7101818.html) [ ](https://ukrainian.voanews.com/a/kotin-interview-zaes-anomna-energia/7101818.html)that the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhya atomic power plant is "constantly increasing", the occupying power turns the occupied market into a military base. According to him, the number of Russian military Nazes is constantly increasing and now exceeds the number of staff. There were almost 2500 in the Rota soldier there, while there were about 500, Kotin said.

Energoatom's President stressed that if the station takes place at the station, radiation pollution can spread not only to half of Ukraine and the Black and Chornomore, but also to affect Europe seriously.

“They are currently(Russians - ed.)There is only one idea - to keep the station as its own base, because it is a security area, and nuclear material protects Samsebe. Therefore, they understand that the shelling of nuclear materials will not be due to the risk of pollution, ”Kotin said, recognizing that the station is essentially a hostage to the Russian Federation.

Kotin also said that from the very beginning of the occupation - March 4, 2022 - Russian troops established their regime, and Russian President Vladimirputin issued a decree on the creation of an operating organization based on the people of the people, the state monopoly of Russia in nuclear energy.

"Nuclear tests, various attempts to launch missiles and ballistic tests are a sign that the dangerous situation here remains unchanged.

** Dear Ukrainians!**

We complete this very difficult, but very important week. On Friday - Ligaarabian states. Saturday and Sunday - G7 plus Ukraine and the extended format - seven plus partners, including the global south, plus Ukraine. Intensively.

The world hears our position. The protection and guarantees of security, the return of all our territories, all our people, justice, the realization of our formula of peace ... As for every significant point for Ukraine, we have an understanding with the world. And together we will increase Ukrainian potential.

This Saturday is the Day of Science in Ukraine, and the more we give Ukraine, the more we give to all who work in this noble sphere. I congratulate all scientists!

Today, on Sunday, here, in Hiroshima, Ukraine was a truly honorary participant in the Great Seven. Ukrainian topics - central, honor to all Ukrainians - special. Thank you "Seven"!

Meeting with President Biden - and, as always, we become stronger after such intervals. Meeting with Indonesia leader is meaningful. Meeting with Korea Presidential Republic is a potential for a strong relationship. Meeting with Canada Trudeau Prime Minister-thank you, Justin, you. He talked to leaders and Australia. Separately and in detail with the Prime Minister of Japan-let's increase cooperation.

There was also a very important ceremony and appeal to the Museum of Peace in Hiroshima ...

Our unity with the world, our protection for Ukrainians and our power - the power of the Ukrainian state - will also be the most worthy commemoration of the memory of our people - different generations - whose life has been broken and trampled by the Russian gap, this long -term tyranny, which changes shapes but kills the equivalent.

Today is the Day of Remembrance of Victims of Political Repression ... The Day of Remembrance of All who have been in the Soviet regime. We do not forget what was, we do not forget, weaken, and do not forget that we are obliged to be strong.

And we will always.

**Glory to Ukraine!**

Загальна мета TCCCполягає в тому, щоб навчити воїнів ефективно надавати допомогу пораненим убою, водночас запобігаючи додатковим втратам особового складу і є запорукоюуспішного виконання бойового завдання.

Одна із засновниць центру тактичної медицини «КоЛеСо», бойовий медик ОльгаОмельчук розповідає:

«Ми готуємо інструкторів у військовій частині, яких обираємо середвійськовослужбовців цього військового колективу. Досконало відпрацьовуємо зними перший базовий рівень протоколу, щоб згодом вони навчали іншихвійськовослужбовців. І що найголовніше — кожного тижня тренували особовийсклад своїх підрозділів. Це неможливо забезпечити за допомогою сторонніхінструкторів, які приїжджають на певний час. Кожна військова частина повиннамати власних інструкторів, які будуть здійснювати постійне, системнетренування. Серед усієї групи ми проводимо перший модуль навчання — це тридні, потім ми формуємо програму за якою займаються визначені нами старшігрупи, вони продовжують тренувати майбутніх інструкторів. Коли вони завершатьнавчання, то будуть здійснювати правильну підготовку своїх побратимів длянадання допомоги пораненим на полі бою».

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-21T50-00-00-04-00/g7-2.jpeg)Mr. Kisido, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the invitation to visit the summit.

Dear colleagues!

During this war, Ukraine participated six times in meetings of the Seven Group, but online. Now - a moment for personal thanks.

We, together with you and all our allies and partners, have reached such a level of work that provides for democracy, international law, to freedom.

In the world, there were efforts to ignore and despise what we value. But now it is cenived. Now our power is growing. And anyone who can wish the anti -democratic country's aggression sees what the answer will be. And the more we will work with you, the less likely it is that someone in the world will go crazy. But is this enough?

Democracy needs more. I think we need the obvious global leadership of democracy. This is the main thing that we provide our cooperation.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-21T50-00-00-04-00/g7-1.jpeg)Here are some examples.

For many years, we have heard that Russia can attack any country with hypersonic missiles that have not been knocked down. Russia wanted to be afraid of some moment to betray our values. Well, it is over. The "Petriets" of the Ukrainians have shown what democracy was capable of.

We together proved that the question is not how many missiles are in our country enemy, but in how many air defense systems we have. "Petriots", "Iris-T", "Nams", "Classes", "Samp-T"-they protect life in our cities and rescue a global safety brand for democracy.

When such air defense systems in Ukraine are enough to protect all cities, the world will see which air shield is able to create democracy. We are moving what the safety of the sky will be, not our enemy.

I thank you, dear leaders who helped Ukraine with air defense!Together, we have saved Russian rockets for thousands and thousands of lives of Ukrainians.

I am also grateful for the decision to train our pilots on modern fighters.

The air shield can only be complete when ground systems are filled with modern aircraft in the air. Now we are going on the way to eliminate the breakdown.

When our pilots know the F-16 and when these machines appear in our sky, it is not only for Ukraine. It will be a historic moment for the entire security architecture in Europe and the world.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-21T50-00-00-04-00/g7.jpeg)Dear colleagues!Each decision for the protection of Ukraine and freedom guarantees the preservation of international rules based on the rules. As the house grows from the bricks, so the decision with you is growing freedom - we guarantee it. We, democracy.

And our answer is, in fact, the basis for the mandatory rules for preventing aggression.

Ukraine emphasizes the principle of preventive security. That is why our suggestions for the security package for Ukraine - when they work - will become a comprehensive factor. And not just for us.

There are "safety umbrellas" in the world. And they have to open when the sky is blackened. But how will it be the one at a time, while the "security umbrella" expands to a new ally?

Just as our actions with you have saved the international law of Tasvoboda during this war, our security guarantees will work to prevent the tragedy of war. They will work to stop the potential aggressor.

Ukraine would like our teams to place dots over "i" in the case of guaranteeing Vilnius - the summit for which the Euro -Atlantic is expected.

Thank you, Mr. President Biden, that you fill the content of global safety for democracy!Thank you for the leadership, for the weapons, for the decision to feed pilots. I believe that the wings of our common freedom will be more obvious in the world!Thank you to both parties of Congress and yours, Mr. President, a team and all a love -loving American hearts.

I thank you, Olafe, Mr. Chancellor, for your determination, which changes the history of democracy, for the long -term defensive and financial support of Ukraine, which gives stability to all our free Europe. I thank your colleagues in the government, thank the Bundestag and the whole people of Germany.

I thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your energy, which gives us more and more long-range opportunities. I believe that your leadership will help to give the obvious force of law when, together with our partners, a mom -tribunal on Russia's aggression. Thank you to your colleagues, the British Parliament and the whole British people.

I thank you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, for saving the values and that the support of France of Ukraine is a manifestation of respect for freedom people, for equality in international relations, for brotherhood between people.

I thank George Meloni for the power of her character gives us all. Thank you to the Government, Parliament and all Italians who support our people's protection.Thank you, Charles, thank you, Ursulo, for being more than institutions under your leadership of the Memorial Institution. It was once said that the EU is a Tsyburecracy. You prove that our association is not kept on bureaucracy, but of the durable values that give us a strong course!

Thank you, Fumio, Mr. Prime Minister, for the obvious leadership of Japan in Asia's fate of international law, thank you for comprehensive support from your country.

Dear colleagues!

We are united by another principle - rationality. We always act practically, protecting our values. And the obvious expression of rationality is the Ukrainian formula of peace. I thank you for the support of our formula.

The day before I was at the Summit of the Arab States League, and we do everything to connect the whole world around the formula of peace - around a peaceful summit, which will give a push of a formula.

I would like to discuss the steps from the implementation of the formula and details of the organization of a peaceful summit within our meetings today.

Thank you.

** Dear leaders!**

We all have a chance to become co -authors of peace. This peace will not be for one country, as well as this war is not only harmful to Ukraine. The UN Charter and the order based on the direction were destroyed.

Everyone in the world has felt the destructive consequences of Russian aggression. Someone has worked out of crazy jumps for food or energy. Someone will see that in the case of a catastrophe on the Russian nuclear power plant, the wind is precious pollution to its land. Someone knows that if Russia manages to collapse the stolen Ukrainian territory, then on its land a receiving neighbor.

Our world is big, but we all have in it together. And this is our common thing - peace.

At one time, until February 24, Ukraine spent more than 180 rounds with Russia - 183 - in various formats for termination of aggression. There were respectful international intermediaries in those interrogations, and they saw that Russia was not looking for peace.

The truce did not work. It lasted seven years, and during this time thousands of people were killed. Now nothing has changed, except that we, when we defended ourselves, weakened Russia. Now she is frankly looking for frosts of war. Not for the sake of peace, but for the sake of winning a little time, growing strength and hitting again.

The one who has embarked on the path of terror does not come from him.

That is why our formula of peace and international law are needed. Ukraine has proposed a formula of peace to the world. While the Russian invaders remain on our earth, no one will sit at the table of negotiations with Russia. The colonizer must go away. Alesvit has a power sufficient to make Russia to restore Russia step by step. We have proven that.

As an example, food safety. This is one of the points of our peace formula.

When Russia blocked our sea, we found a way out. We agreed with the UN Iturechyna to create a corridor for food exports so that no one in the world will be angry or food shortages.

Together we stabilized the markets. So we gave the world an element of peace. And by analogy, it can also work for each other point of the formula of peace, starting with radiation - which is very dangerous - and energy security and ending the restoration of the full force of the UN Charter and our territorial integrity, so that they have been violated by Russia.

We have developed a peace formula so that each of its points is supported by resolutions. So that everyone in the world can choose the point that can help realize.From Japan to Arab countries, from Europe to Latin America - we find support for the formula of peace. And we continue this work.

Soon - 500 days of a full -scale war, in July it will be. And this is a symbolic time of time, a good moon to collect the formula of peace - the world of world. The summit of anyone who respects honesty and wants to end this war. I am going to join together!

Even if we are divided by the distance, we are united by a common understanding: you were bruised, if your home had fallen into your home if the enemy came to your gate ideported your children, you would not seem to be colonialists, you would unite all world, you would fight like We fight.

**Thank you!**

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-21T58-00-00-04-00/ganna-malyar-fb.jpg)To discuss the President of Ukraine's person during the hot phase of the war in a state -of -the -art context, let's say the upcoming elections are simply incorrect, because Cene corresponds to his real role and place in the defense process.

About it on your Facebook page [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/ganna.maliar/posts/pfbid02VSZ6f5et2eKi7erTKnh8kNooHMpdGDyEoaCSqmYLfEAhyBZPxLJ3eYMrdfezx5Mvl?locale=ms_MY)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar.

It is just worth knowing that the President during the war is first and foremost the highest head of Ukraine.

He is the top of the military vertically.

In the conditions of a full -scale war, the President ceases to be in a classic sense, and other tasks are just about him.

The main is to win the war and keep the state.

The president for the military is not a politician, but a leader.

Instead, the enemy consciously manipulates and mixes politics with the military tasks of the Commander -in -Chief.

Among the military, such notes can not undermine confidence, because in the military, the Commander -in -Chief enjoys an undeniable authority.

I personally see it constantly - both during the President's work with command and during the visit of the President to the districts of hostilities and communication there.

But in civil society it is necessary to separate during the war and not to mix politics with purely military tasks, which is solved today by the High Chief Commander.

Here is an example of some tasks in the military vertical, which is performed by the High Chief Commander daily.

The President collects and listens to the military command and all security forces. It is not just a hearing of reports - this is an analysis of the current situation and the necessary decisions.

The Supreme Commander -in -Chief, all the power agencies, gathers several times a week. There have never been formal protocol solutions, these are always prompt decisions in the situation.

The Military Cabinet also works - this is another format of work of the High Chief Commander of the Armed Forces and the military command.

The President is constantly taken care of by the issues of weapons and military equipment for Ukraine at the highest international level.

It's not all about elections and not about politics. This is about the role of the president-river head of the state in defense of the state.

That's how now. The situation is quite difficult - not only in us, but also with them.

Therefore, in time, to throw us a discussion about the presidential elections and to talk to propolitical prospects.

Russia's large -scale war against Ukraine lasts 452 days. On a recent forumlider of the Firest International Crime Advisory Group(Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group), which took place in Warsaw, General Prosecutor Andriy Kostin reported that more than 88,000 -war crimes have been registered in Ukraine. The crime under Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine "Violation of Laws and Customs" has already been considered by Ukrainian courts.

In particular, recently from 11 to 12 years of imprisonment under this article convicted nine military personnel of the 64th Separate Rifle Brigade of the Sukhoputnaya Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the 35th All The murder of a civilian man. The invaders inflicted him injuries to obtain information on the location of military personnel and territorial defense.

However, nowadays military criminals are wanted and, probably, if they survive in this war, in the Ukrainian prison will be after the victory of Ukraine by Russia.

It is even difficult to imagine what the load will lie on the international and national superstition in our victory, which will consider a huge number of proceedings against war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law.

But, oddly enough, even now, when the invaders are killed and raped daily, when they destroy everything they see, in our legal expert environment, they reflect on a fair trial over them and discuss the question of giving them a worthy protection in processes.

The Coordination Center for the provision of free legal aid has placed the official page and YouTube channel the first of a series of video lectures for advocates on the exercise of the right to a fair court and competent protection of public crimes. Its theme is “[the role of a lawyer in the lawsuits of state crimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imUpQ_Be4JM)”.

A lawyer from the United Kingdom David Guper has been specializing in criminal law, international law, crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide for 25 years. He was a lawyer of the Rwanda International Tribuna, the International Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia Tamzhzhzhis Criminal Court.

In his video lecture, he revealed such important aspects as the preparation of the pre -trial process, the analysis of evidence and protection arguments.The lectures were prepared within the joint project of the International Bar Association, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine and the Coordination Center for Legal Assistance with the support of the Association of Lawyers of Ukraine.

Despite the fact that we now control a small part of Bakhmut, the value of its defense does not lose its relevance. This gives us the opportunity to enter the city in the mind of changes in the situation. And this will certainly happen.

We continue to move on the flanks in the suburbs of Bakhmut and we actually reconcile to taking the city in a tactical environment. Thanks to this, we can control all the high -rise buildings, occupied, the enemy and gradually destroy them. This deprives the enemy control over the approaches to the city and gives us some tactical advantages.

** Dear Ukrainians!**

We complete this very difficult, but very important week. On Friday - Ligaarabian states. Saturday and Sunday - G7 plus Ukraine and the extended format - seven plus partners, including the global south, plus Ukraine. Intensively.

The world hears our position. The protection and guarantees of security, the return of all our territories, all our people, justice, the realization of our formula of peace ... As for every significant point for Ukraine, we have an understanding with the world. And together we will increase Ukrainian potential.

This Saturday is the Day of Science in Ukraine, and the more we give Ukraine opportunities, the more we give to all who work in this noble sphere. I congratulate all scientists!

Today, on Sunday, here, in Hiroshima, Ukraine was a truly honorary participant in the Great Seven. Ukrainian topics - central, honor to all Ukrainians - special. Thank you "Seven"!

Meeting with President Biden - and, as always, we become stronger after such intervals. Meeting with Indonesia leader is meaningful. Meeting with Korea Presidential Republic is a potential for a strong relationship. Meeting with Canada Trudeau Prime Minister-thank you, Justin, you. He talked to leaders and Australia. Separately and in detail we spoke with Prime Minister of Japan-let's increase cooperation.

There was also a very important ceremony and appeal to the Museum of Peace in Hiroshima ...

Our unity with the world, our protection for Ukrainians and our power - the power of the Ukrainian state - will also be the most worthy commemoration of the memory of our people - different generations - whose life was broken and trampled by the Russian gap, this long -term tyranny that changes shape, but kills the equivalent.

Today is the Day of Remembrance of Victims of Political Repression ... The Day of Remembrance of All who have been in the Soviet regime. We do not forget what was, we do not forget, weaken, and do not forget that we are obliged to be strong.

And we will always.

**Glory to Ukraine!**
