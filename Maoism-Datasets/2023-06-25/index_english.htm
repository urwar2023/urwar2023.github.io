<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-24T85-00-00-04-00/ganna-malyar.jpg" />The political crisis in the Russian Federation was predictable and inevitable.</p>
<p>About this <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/882">deputy</a>The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Hannamars wrote in her telegram.</p>
<p>Anna Malyar emphasized that Ukrainians can regard events that have begun asleep as the inevitable degradation of the Russian state.</p>
<p>For Ukraine, this is a window of opportunity, but it is not necessary to relax, it is better to be careful and prepared for any scenario.</p>
<p>"We are working on our strengthening and victory," she said.</p>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Defense noted that the imperial campaign on new lands could not cover the internal problems in the state - only aggravating. What is Ivid. Whatever the state they build, they still get a "gulag", which sooner or later rebels and breaks down.</p>
<p>“The war in Ukraine has shown the weakest place of the Russian Empire - fear of preference. All their solutions are based on lies. They always created "air locks" for the king and believed in them themselves. This is such an imperial feature - to indulge in your own grandeur and overestimate yourself. This was prompted by a completely adequate decision - to solve the war with Ukraine without systematic truthful calculations of their own capabilities. Exclusively ambition and arrogance. The price of this non -governmental solution is the fate of Russia itself. They are fighting with us and destroying themselves, ”her post reads.</p>
<p>Anna Malyar emphasized that if you look globally at this as an evolutionary process, then a non -viable system launched a self -destruction program. There is no conspiracy or world conspiracy. These are natural processes.</p>
<p>“They will destroy themselves as a state in this form, and we will naturally defeat themselves, are painfully ready to move forward. We are a nation that now creates a new type of culture in the world. To us - culture always lost barbarism. We prove that you can be strong, protect yourself and remain civilized. Therefore, the future is behind us, and Russia is the past, ” - summarized.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, said this <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101720">Ukrainian radio</a>Yevgeny Doroganov, Head of the Department of Anti -Retails in the field of computer systems of the National Police Department.</p>
<p>"As for Paul Durov(The creator of the Telegram messenger - ed.), indeed, this person is a herosian. It was said that he had some relationship with Putin or SPECCULES <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia">RF</a>. Now it is on equal rumors. But I would advise you to use other messengers. There is a large number of them, thank you, it is a saignal, it is a Vozap, it is already in the extreme case oftelegram. But again, it should be borne in mind that people will rather be used by Telegram. Why? Because almost all the news is there now. It is necessary to simply rationally approach the use of such a messenger, knowing that it can be controlled by special services of the Russian Federation. It is meant to dispose of some sensitive data, to delete such information, "he said.</p>
<p>Doroganov added that Tiktok himself does not use because of a civic position. "I want to support this network, because, for example, it blocks some waves of human rights information, and propaganda ideo, which cultivates the modern political system in China, on the contrary, feeds and grows," he said.</p>

<p>This was stated by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in an interview with the US media.</p>
<p>According to Blinken, the uprising of Prigogine against Putin emphasizes that the decree of the Russian leader also invaded Ukraine in his country.</p>
<p>“If you put it in a context 16 months ago, Putin was on the threshold of Kiev in Ukraine, trying to take the city in a matter of days, to wipe the country from the map. Now it was to defend Moscow, the capital of Russia, against its own mercenary, ” - said Blinken in an interview <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wagner-uprising-russia-shows-cracks-putins-power-ukraine/story?id=100358489">ABC News</a>.</p>
<p>“So, I think it is obvious - we see how cracks appear. Where they will go, if they go, when they leave, it is very difficult to say. I do not want to speculate this, "Blinken said, adding that" I don't think we saw the final act. "</p>
<p>"So much everything under the surface has now expired the premiums of the preconditions for war, in terms of war, the view of the view that it really brought Russia," Blinken said.</p>
<p>On channel air <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-25-23/index.html">CNN</a>The Secretary of State noted that this situation can be a statutory for Ukraine during a counter -offensive. “Since Russia is now being released, Putin has to worry about what is happening in Russia, as well as that he is not trying to make in Ukraine. I think this creates an additional advantage for Ukrainians, ”said.</p>
<p>“The fact that you have from the inside a person who directly casts doubt on someone's fulfillment directly calls into question the prerequisites on which this agression was started against Ukraine. This in itself is something very powerful. This is adding. Where they go when they appear, it is too early to speak, but it raises new questions that Putin will have to deal with, ”the US Secretary of State.<strong> Read also: </strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3727536-svit-pobaciv-so-vladu-putina-mozna-hitnuti-zseredini-estonskij-parlamentarij.html">The world has seen that Putin's power can be swept inside -Essonic parliamentarian</a>On the air <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/antony-blinken-secretary-of-state-face-the-nation-transcript-06-25-2023/">CBS News</a>Blinken stated that he had raised deep questions about this incident himself as a prerequisite for Russian aggression against Ukraine during the whole incident, saying that Ukraine or NATO had no threats to Russia, which is part of Putin's narrative. “And it was Putin's direct call.

<p>Blinken also suggested that the threats to Putin's authorities, caused by non -precedent events may not have ended and may last weeks or months. He also called Prigoine a "growing thunderstorm" within Russia.</p>

<p>About this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvuq0ur8VXY">video closer</a>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p><em>Video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua/videos/1276926429863532">Presidential Office</a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>He has just completed a series of international conversations-with the President of the United States Baiden, with Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, with President of Poland And Jezhduda. Positive conversations, very much needed now for all of us.</p>
<p>First. Of course, we discussed the fighting on the forefront, our active actions. Heads for partners for supporting - she is very important and really helping the warriors to move forward. Now Russian invaders are suffered by the losses that they need. Each loss of them is a long -term increase in freedom.</p>
<p>We also discussed the further strengthening of Ukrainian soldiers, and I thank my partners to understand our needs - long -range needs. I am especially grateful to the Presidentubiden and the United States for the reliability of Petriots. They discussed the strengthening of artillery, MLRS and more.</p>
<p>Second. The situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station. The attention of the world to the existing Russian threat at the Zaporozhye station, unfortunately, is not enough. As a bunnedosta and the reaction to the Russian undermining the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, the tricky efforts of Russian terrorists to hit the dam of another reservoir with the cover.</p>
<p>He proved the information to our partners that we have, in our intelligence on the Russian -scenario with the Ministry of NPP, which for terrorists is obviously approved. We have to do-all together in the world-quite specific, to prevent any radiation incidents.</p>
<p>Third. The longer Russian aggression lasts, the greater the degradation it causes and Russia itself. One of the manifestations of such degradation is that Russian aggression returns to his native harbor. We exchanged in conversations with the leaders of what is happening in Russia. We see the development of the situation equally how to react.It remains only 15 days before the start of the NATO summit in Vilnius, and we do the summit that the summit has real meaning. Strong content. Positive solutions for Ukraine in Vilnius are the only possible positive solutions for our common security in Europe and in general in the Alliance.</p>
<p>Thank you all who support Ukraine!I thank Mr. Biden President, Congress, both parties and all Americans for the historical strengthening of freedom in the world!Thanks to the Prime Minister Trudeau and all Canadians for the unchanged support!I thank Panupra-President Dudi and everyone in Poland who stands with Ukraine side by side of the fate of Europe!</p>

<p>“The Embassy of Ukraine in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-izrail">State of Israel</a>He regret stresses that the current government of Israel has chosen the path of close cooperation with the Rivne Federation. This is evidenced by a number of rather contradictory events that have been given in the first half of 2023 and which coincided with the almost complete reference of Israeli humanitarian aid to Ukraine, ”the presentation reads.</p>
<p>Among these events, the Embassy notes "The Ruture Visit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israelud of Ukraine in February this year and a number of interviews by Prime Minister Benjaminethanetanias of Israeli media, in particular, with The Jerusalem Post dated June 22."</p>
<p>“First of all, all the relevant statements of the Prime Minister of Israel have always been focused on justifying Israel's inaction in providing a defense assistance for the last 1.5 years. Initially, the arguments were concentrated by Israel's relations with Russia in Syria and the fragile position of the Jewish Power Plant in the Russian Federation. However, in the last interview, the assumptions have been presented and speculative assumptions that suggest the transfer of Western combat from the battlefield in Ukraine of Syrian and Iranian regimes, ”the statement reads.</p>

In addition, the Balode -heed agreement to create another Russian diplomatic mission of Jerusalem, for which even the land was allocated for free, which was represented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a "great achievement".</p>
<p>In addition, the Embassy notes the neglect of the moral boundaries by many Mimalian officials who took part in the diplomatic reception of the Russian Embassy in Jerusalem a week ago. In particular, the MSIZRAIL ignores Putin's regular anti -Semitic statements.The embassy also added that as long as the Ukrainian people, including its significant community, are flowing blood through the attacks of Russian missiles and Iranian non -Vaspilots, the Israeli leadership, covering themselves with verbal demagogy of their neutrality, actively establish relations with the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the Israeli government has little attention to the opinion of its own people and the ignorance of the world Jewish diaspora, which unambiguously supports Ukraine in its combat with Russian state terrorism. We urge the Israeli government to change our position and support Ukraine with defense means, to support it with Russian state terrorism, ”the Embassy of Ukraine summarized the statement.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it writes <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2023/06/25/putina-ne-bylo-nigde">"Medusa"</a>With reference to the supra from the ruling circles of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>The interlocutors close to the Kremlin recognize that the rebellion has weakened the position <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin">Putin</a>. "He could not go down to the way, but yesterday [after the television] was nowhere. He is the" king "," first ", but the tin -Mukh, when it is necessary to interve The source said.</p>
<p>According to one of the interlocutors of the "jellyfish" close to the presidential administration, Putin will now be more difficult to "collect vertical power" - and attempts to "reinforce the system" by "Russian elites" will only become more.</p>
<p>According to Medusa sources close to the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation, about the middle of the day of June 24, Prigogine, with which the authorities had tried before, began to communicate with the Kremlin. And even "he tried to call Putin, but the President did not want to talk to him."</p>

At that moment, the mercenaries were already near the River Oka - the Sametam the Russian army and Rosgvardia decided to build the first line of defense of the Navagnets. At the same time, despite the statements of Prigogine that it is necessary to prepare with him a "half army"(And despite the fact that in the regions he did not receive any other security officers), there was no additional support for the first hours of the UPVC uprising.</p>
<p>Seeing the mood of Prigogine, the Kremlin allegedly decided not to go to "bloody". At the same time, the final negotiations were engaged in large group officials, which among others included the head of the Presidential Administration Antonovacha, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Mykola Patrushev and Russia's Ambassador to Belarusiboryn Grizlov. Alexander Lukashenko spoke "Frontman" of this band.According to a source close to the Kremlin, Prigogine insisted that the first persons were involved in the negotiation. “The prison needed a decent confident to get out of the game [keeping your face]. This is Lukashenko. He loves PR and understanding, so he agreed, ”the interlocutor says.</p>
<p>The sources of "jellyfish", close to the Kremlin and the Government of the Russian Federation, agree that the susceptes of the radical speech to Prigogin lost: "He is displaced from Russia. The president does not forgive such." According to them, the parties will still "discuss" the details of the agreement on the new position of Prigogine, but "the former influence of the tresers will not have."</p>

Strong content. Positive solutions for Ukraine in Vilnius are the only possible positive solutions for our common security in Europe and in general in the Alliance.</p>

Among the serious-C-300 in the Zaporozhye region. Response to such a complex should be fast, as the rocket flies quite long. Recently, we saw how the rocket was released by the enemy - more than half a hundred from different directions, - said Colonel Yuri Ignat, on the air of the only news.</p>
<p>He added that we need ATACMS missiles that are used in the Tactical and Tactical Complex and are able to produce very significant results. It is a ballistic range of up to 300 kilometers, which can be directed from HIMARS systems. Vonana leaves the enemy's chances: he destroys his rear control points, commands, ammunition depots and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have missiles of the far radius in the form of winged Storm Shadow missiles, which we have a positive result. To interrupt the enemy's logistics paths is the key to our success, at the same time as an advantage in the air. Our pilots at the beginning of a large -scale invasion destroyed the columns of the Russians very quickly, performing aircraft. Today, aviation and long -range weapons are exalted for Ukraine. The rockets that we have in service with the most distal Radius of action are "point-in". Their radius of action is 120 kilometers, we still use them.

But infantrymen should also have basic knowledge of how to properly recognize mines and how to act if they come across them.</p>
<p>Defenders of one of the individual mechanized crews in breaks between fearing such training measures to constantly improve their skills.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-25T56-00-00-04-00/foto-1-19.jpg" />- Given the current situation, we are constantly neutralizing or installing, - says Saper Igor. - Sometimes it turns out that in a month we do not have a daily day off, because there is a lot of work. If we are tasked with changing a certain area, then we need to immediately understand that it is quite a large cut of the territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/foto-2-18.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-25T56-00-00-04-00/foto-2-18-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

<ul>
<li>It all depends on the task. Sometimes it is necessary to stop the hostile infantry, and inhibited equipment. For the most part, we install anti -tank mines, because our infantry is very well destroyed by our brothers, - adds to the serviceman.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to him, they are constantly confronted with the enemy's special concern and meanness. After the release of the right bank of Kherson region, the residents of the de -industrial villages were asked to change their homes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-25T56-00-00-04-00/foto-5-14.jpg" />- It was in the village of Truthine. In fact, it is quite difficult to exchanging people's homes, because it was there that we were expected from the occupiers in the most unexpected places. One of these cases happened when a woman called us home. The enemy expelled her and lived in the hut. When they entered the house, seven stretch marks were noticed. After that, they examined everything very carefully, and the Kidam seemed to have nothing left, then our attention was attracted by the hell. As it turned out, they were replaced. The inhuman is simple, ”Igor recalls.</p>
<p>Now the main task of the Sapper platoon is to teach in the most shortermines of Ukrainian infantrymen to distinguish between mines and in a critical situation to harm them.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/foto-6-14.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-25T56-00-00-04-00/foto-6-14-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>

Training from sappers is really useful for us, because the hospital is always "at zero". The knowledge gained allows you to save life and health. The more and better we will train and learn here, the more we will be able to stop the enemy on the "front", - says the Pichotinets with the call sign "Ali".</p>

<p>According to the representative of the GRU of Ukraine, the solution of the problem of bypassing the sanction depends on effective export control.</p>
<p>“It is, by the way, not just about the components. There are other issues related to weapons: modern machine tools, software, separate -immigrants and substances that are needed by Russia. All this today is on the primary control. In order not to allow to restore and build production in the territory of the Russian territory, our task is now clearly identifying that Russian MIC, which components are used by the aggressor state and what it has a deficit, ”said Vadim Skibitsky, noting that Ukraine is paying considerable attention to the problem He works with international partners to solve it.</p>

<p>This was stated in an interview with the British edition of The New Statement by the Chief Chief of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine General-General of Majorkirlo Budanov.</p>
<p>According to him, nuclear reactors without cooling can melt for 10 hours to 14 days.</p>
<p>The NPP accident can also lead to increased voltage on the lines on lines.</p>
<p>“The plan of the terrorist attack for the ZPP is fully developed and approved. They can use technical means to accelerate the caras, ”Kirilobudanov said.</p>
<p>The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine recalled the Ministry of Health of the Russian Troops, and also reported the placement of the occupants of the equipment at about 4 out of 6 power units of the station.</p>
<p>"The situation has never been as serious as it is now," Kirilobudanov emphasized.</p>
<p>According to the head of the GRU of Ukraine, the order of the state-aggressor to commit a terrorist attack of Nazes can be caused by the defeat of Russian-occupation troops on the left-wing of the Dnieper-the creation of a zone of nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to Cyril Budanov, there is a risk that Muscovy can make an attacker at the Radiation Revealing as a "preventive measure" in order to stop Ukraine and freeze the front line in its current form.</p>

<p>Such exit polls give <a href="https://www.dw.com/uk/na-viborah-u-grecii-peremogli-konservatori-premera-micotakisa-ekzitpoli/a-66027497">dw</a>, reports Ukrinform</p>
<p>According to exitpol, conducted by the State TV and Radio Company ERT, 40% to 44% of voters voted for "Novudemcravia".</p>
<p>In the second place is the left party of Siriz Expremier Alexis Tsipras indicating from 16% to 19% of the vote. Next comes the Greek socialist movement(10-13%).</p>
<p>Ці вибори, нагадує DW, проводяться за новим виборчим законодавством -посиленою пропорційною системою, яка передбачає автоматичний бонус у виглядівід 20 до 50 додаткових мандатів для партії-переможниці.</p>

<p>We will remind, "New Democracy" won the elections on May 21, ahead of the 20% of the left party of Siriz.</p>
<p>However, the conservatives did not recruit the absolute majority necessary for the formation of a law without a coalition, so a new election was announced.</p>

During the day, the southern and northern flanks of the Ovrobakhmut were traveled from 600 to 1000 meters, 186 invaders were destroyed, 224 were injured, 8 took the Vpolon. Also destroyed tank, BMP, 2 SAUs, 2 HRSV "Grad", 3 anti-tank complexes, 3 MSTA-B guns, anti-aircraft missile complex "Arrow-10", 6-line compositions with ammunition, 3 drones-Kamikadze "Lancet" and 1 Orlan-10 drone,-spokesman of the Eastern Urgent Troops Colonel Sergey Cherevaty said on the broadcast of the "One News".</p>
<p>According to the officer, the enemy pulls up airborne units, infantry, combat army reserve, territorial troops, other units of PEC type "patriot", "torch", "veterans", assault mouths "Z" in the Bakhmut area, and showing a great desire to keep this city. The invaders could not capture him in 10 months. So losing Bakhmut - for the Russians will be the apogee of their shame.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, we know their intentions, units, commanders, tactics. And everything is tested in our plans, and nothing will help them thanks to heroism, professionalism and motivation of our soldiers. Along with this, the situation on the front was also on the situation with the "Wagner", because the defeat on the front was the fact that the "Wagnets" shamefully fled. So it caused a split of the rows. The only main side of them is the number of personal composition. We do not give them to convert numerous advantages into any success, and being more trained and motivated, we force the enemy to retreat. Even we are striking from 1-2 shots,-said Sergey Cherevaty.</li>

<p>He has just completed a series of international conversations-with the President of the United States Baiden, with Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, with President of Poland Andrzejududa. Positive conversations, very much needed now for all of us.</p>
<p>First. Of course, we discussed the fighting on the forefront, our active actions. Headed to partners for supporting the support - it is very important and really helping the warriors to move forward. Now Russian invaders are suffered by the losses that they need. Each loss of them is a long -term increase in freedom.</p>
<p>They also discussed the further strengthening of Ukrainian soldiers, and I thank my partners to understand our needs - long -range needs. I am especially grateful to the Presidentubiden and the United States for the reliability of Petriots. They discussed the strengthening of artillery, MLRS and more.</p>
<p>Second. The situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station. The attention of the world to the existing Russian threat at the Zaporozhye station, unfortunately, is not enough. As a bunnedosta and the reaction to the Russian undermining the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, the tricky efforts of Russian terrorists to hit the dam of another reservoir with the cover.</p>
<p>He proved the information to our partners that we have, in our intelligence on the Russian -scenario with the Ministry of NPP, which for terrorists is obviously approved. We have to do-all together in the world-quite specific, to prevent any radiation incidents.</p>
<p>Third. The longer Russian aggression lasts, the greater the degradation it causes and Russia itself. One of the manifestations of such degradation is that Russian aggression returns to his native harbor. We exchanged in conversations with the leaders of what is happening in Russia. We see the development of the situation equally how to react.</p>
<p>And one more. Very important meetings were held today in Copenhagen. Formatic advisers. The office of the office - Andriy Yermak, as well as Andriy Sibiga, as well as Igor Zhovkva, met with political advisers of the leaders of Turkey, India, Japan, South Africa and European Union institutions. We approach the formula of peace, and for this we attract as wide as possible a circle of partners.</p>
<p>Relations with the European Union are also unchanged with a top priority, we add a full-time soil every week.Thank you all who support Ukraine!I thank Mr. Biden President, Congress, both parties and all Americans for the historical strengthening of freedom in the world!Thanks to the Prime Minister Trudeau and all Canadians for the unchanged support!I thank Panupra-President Dudi and everyone in Poland who stands with Ukraine side by side of the fate of Europe!</p>
<p>Glory to our soldiers!Glory to every brigade, which is now moving on the front ...</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-26T98-00-00-04-00/mennes.jpg" />Greetings to the graduates of the Taras Shevchenko Military Institute, Braian Menness, a maider-Major of Liberty Fort, the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>My greetings from Liberty Fort, previously known as Fort Bragg, North, the largest in the world's military base, as well as places in its history and devotion to the values of freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to express my gratitude to the brigade General Anatoliishevchenko for the opportunity to share with you a few tips, as Vasaclas prepares graduates who, while risking their own lives, take on a sensotement to perform tasks that will undoubtedly help protect Ukraine.</p>
<p>I recently dismissed the deputy commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. At one time, we were a unit of the US Armed Forces, which supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine from February to December 2022. The armeds of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine were incredibly impressed by us.</p>
<p>In 2000, more than 23 years ago, I participated in one of the first exercises with the program "Partnership for Peace" in the west of Ukraine, near Lviv, he drew for joint strategic planning together with the then commander of the Armed Forces, Colonel Ivan Yakubts. For me, this was a good experience. Comparing the condition of your army then and now, I am amazed at how much the armed forces of Ukraine have strengthened, in particular, thanks to such co -wanders as you.</p>
<p>More than 35 years ago, I graduated from the Academy in the West Point. Among the Academy's immigrants, there is a belief that if the release ceremony rains, the graduates will be war. In our case, the belief has come true. For more than five years, he managed the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also answered for planning the actions of the combined command of special operations of the efficiency of the deployment in these countries. He also performed the duties of the battalion and brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division, the first Ranger battalion and the 10th Mountain Division Commander.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I did not have such combat experience as the one that is obtained in Ukraine, however, I am deeply convinced that there are inviolability that commanders should possess:* be technically aware. Commanders should be experts in their field;</p>
<ul>
<li>be a real mentor. Commanders must prepare the unit in general, and every serviceman in particular, to ensure the coherence of actions; * be attentive to your subordinates. Commanders should take care of their subordinates more than themselves and treat them as family members; * be honest. In military affairs, honesty is important. Commanders should always be honest, impartial and reliable. Your service comrades will respect you for it; * adhere to the order of subordination. In military business, there is a certain order of subordination and it is important to comply with it. You should take into account the wisdom and experience of senior commanders, as well as always respect the younger ones; * Study continuously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world is not in place, as well as the challenges we face. Commanders should be open to new knowledge, master new tactics, technologies of Tastrategy. The training should be continuous.</p>
<p>And most importantly, commanders should be true to their country and always hold their word. The devotion and purpose of military service should not be in doubt.</p>
<p>Your main motivation should be to protect and defend the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. In difficult times, military duty and protection of your country are the main call. You are all doing right if you enjoy the time spent on the service. Be careful to the servicemen and educate the subordinates who will appreciate your command qualities.</p>
<p>The power of the army is in its unity. Successful completion of the task is always a common mate.</p>
<p>Finally, take the time to remember those who served us to be sacrificial immune and invaluable experience of which is now an important lesson for us. Honor them do their best to preserve the principles they fought for. I will consider that you will be guided by these tips during your service. Beat, strong and worthy.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to greet you. I really admire you!Good health to you!I pray that one day in Ukraine there will be peace.</p>
