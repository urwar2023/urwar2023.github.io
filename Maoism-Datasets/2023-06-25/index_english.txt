Personally we do not agree. They tried to take away the person of extremely serious injuries, which is between life and death. It will be able to fight, that is, it will not cause any harm to the aggressor country, but it has not been not available. Personnel negotiations can only hurt returns. Such a impression, they deliberately do not give difficult to make us pain. "
Discussed cases where the names of the defenders appear on the Internet several days before the exchange:
“The Russians sometimes make such" showers "two days before the exchange. Sometimes it is unreasonable. And sometimes - not completely.

For Ukraine, this is a window of opportunity, but it is not necessary to relax, it is better to be careful and prepared for any scenario.

“The war in Ukraine has shown the weakest place of the Russian Empire - fear of preference. All their solutions are based on lies. They always created "air locks" for the king and believed in them themselves. This is such an imperial feature - to indulge in your own grandeur and overestimate yourself. This was prompted by a completely adequate decision - to solve the war with Ukraine without systematic truthful calculations of their own capabilities. Exclusively ambition and arrogance. The price of this non -governmental solution is the fate of Russia itself. They are fighting with us and destroying themselves, ”her post reads.
Anna Malyar emphasized that if you look globally at this as an evolutionary process, then a non -viable system launched a self -destruction program. There is no conspiracy or world conspiracy. These are natural processes.
“They will destroy themselves as a state in this form, and we will naturally defeat themselves, are painfully ready to move forward. We are a nation that now creates a new type of culture in the world. To us - culture always lost barbarism. We prove that you can be strong, protect yourself and remain civilized. Therefore, the future is behind us, and Russia is the past, ” - summarized.

I think this creates an additional advantage for Ukrainians, ”said.
“The fact that you have from the inside a person who directly casts doubt on someone's fulfillment directly calls into question the prerequisites on which this agression was started against Ukraine. This in itself is something very powerful. This is adding. Where they go when they appear, it is too early to speak, but it raises new questions that Putin will have to deal with, ”the US Secretary of State.

So it raises deep questions. It shows the realistry region, ”he said
Blinken also suggested that the threats to Putin's authorities, caused by non -precedent events may not have ended and may last weeks or months. He also called Prigoine a "growing thunderstorm" within Russia.
As it was reported, the leader of the Wagner PEC Yevhen Prigogin announced Demarsh against the Russian military leadership, including against the Ministry of Defense Sergei Shoig. He took control of Rostov-on-Don and part of the Okronezh region, after which the Wagnerivtsi went to Moscow.

This is stated in the post of embassy in Facebook , reports Ukrinform.
“The Embassy of Ukraine in State of Israel He regret stresses that the current government of Israel has chosen the path of close cooperation with the Rivne Federation. This is evidenced by a number of rather contradictory events that have been given in the first half of 2023 and which coincided with the almost complete reference of Israeli humanitarian aid to Ukraine, ”the presentation reads.
Among these events, the Embassy notes "The Ruture Visit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israelud of Ukraine in February this year and a number of interviews by Prime Minister Benjaminethanetanias of Israeli media, in particular, with The Jerusalem Post dated June 22."
“First of all, all the relevant statements of the Prime Minister of Israel have always been focused on justifying Israel's inaction in providing a defense assistance for the last 1.5 years. Initially, the arguments were concentrated by Israel's relations with Russia in Syria and the fragile position of the Jewish Power Plant in the Russian Federation. However, in the last interview, the assumptions have been presented and speculative assumptions that suggest the transfer of Western combat from the battlefield in Ukraine of Syrian and Iranian regimes, ”the statement reads.

In addition, the Embassy notes the neglect of the moral boundaries by many Mimalian officials who took part in the diplomatic reception of the Russian Embassy in Jerusalem a week ago. In particular, the MSIZRAIL ignores Putin's regular anti -Semitic statements.The embassy also added that as long as the Ukrainian people, including its significant community, are flowing blood through the attacks of Russian missiles and Iranian non -Vaspilots, the Israeli leadership, covering themselves with verbal demagogy of their neutrality, actively establish relations with the Russian Federation.

“Unfortunately, the Israeli government has little attention to the opinion of its own people and the ignorance of the world Jewish diaspora, which unambiguously supports Ukraine in its combat with Russian state terrorism. We urge the Israeli government to change our position and support Ukraine with defense means, to support it with Russian state terrorism, ”the Embassy of Ukraine summarized the statement.

At that moment, the mercenaries were already near the River Oka - the Sametam the Russian army and Rosgvardia decided to build the first line of defense of the Navagnets. At the same time, despite the statements of Prigogine that it is necessary to prepare with him a "half army"(And despite the fact that in the regions he did not receive any other security officers), there was no additional support for the first hours of the UPVC uprising.

 Sappers are those brave servicemen who are the first to go everywhere to change the territory. But infantrymen should also have basic knowledge of how to properly recognize mines and how to act if they come across them.
Defenders of one of the individual mechanized crews in breaks between fearing such training measures to constantly improve their skills.
 - Given the current situation, we are constantly neutralizing or installing, - says Saper Igor. - Sometimes it turns out that in a month we do not have a daily day off, because there is a lot of work. If we are tasked with changing a certain area, then we need to immediately understand that it is quite a large cut of the territory.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-25T56-00-00-04-00/foto-2-18-150x150.jpg) 
 The sapper also says that before getting a job for work, the intelligence officers who check the territory that must be replaced will be first released.
According to him, they are constantly confronted with the enemy's special concern and meanness. After the release of the right bank of Kherson region, the residents of the de -industrial villages were asked to change their homes.
 - It was in the village of Truthine. In fact, it is quite difficult to exchanging people's homes, because it was there that we were expected from the occupiers in the most unexpected places. One of these cases happened when a woman called us home. The enemy expelled her and lived in the hut. When they entered the house, seven stretch marks were noticed. After that, they examined everything very carefully, and the Kidam seemed to have nothing left, then our attention was attracted by the hell. As it turned out, they were replaced. The inhuman is simple, ”Igor recalls.
Now the main task of the Sapper platoon is to teach in the most shortermines of Ukrainian infantrymen to distinguish between mines and in a critical situation to harm them.
 
 
 - When we are not on the departure, it means that we have to learn something new. Training from sappers is really useful for us, because the hospital is always "at zero". The knowledge gained allows you to save life and health. The more and better we will train and learn here, the more we will be able to stop the enemy on the "front", - says the Pichotinets with the call sign "Ali".

Thus, the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Navadim Skybitsky, noted that a number of components for the military industry of the aggressor fall to Russia under the guise of household goods, and one of the common mechanisms of bypassing sanctions is the creation of a day.
"In some countries of the Russian Federation it creates either joint ventures or opens enterprises that exist one day, a week: products are imported, and then the enterprise disappears," - explained a representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.
According to the representative of the GRU of Ukraine, the solution of the problem of bypassing the sanction depends on effective export control.
“It is, by the way, not just about the components. There are other issues related to weapons: modern machine tools, software, separate -immigrants and substances that are needed by Russia. All this today is on the primary control. In order not to allow to restore and build production in the territory of the Russian territory, our task is now clearly identifying that Russian MIC, which components are used by the aggressor state and what it has a deficit, ”said Vadim Skibitsky, noting that Ukraine is paying considerable attention to the problem He works with international partners to solve it.

The NPP accident can also lead to increased voltage on the lines on lines.
“The plan of the terrorist attack for the ZPP is fully developed and approved. They can use technical means to accelerate the caras, ”Kirilobudanov said.

"The situation has never been as serious as it is now," Kirilobudanov emphasized.
According to the head of the GRU of Ukraine, the order of the state-aggressor to commit a terrorist attack of Nazes can be caused by the defeat of Russian-occupation troops on the left-wing of the Dnieper-the creation of a zone of nuclear disaster.

 Greetings to the graduates of the Taras Shevchenko Military Institute, Braian Menness, a maider-Major of Liberty Fort, the United States Armed Forces.
I want to express my gratitude to the brigade General Anatoliishevchenko for the opportunity to share with you a few tips, as Vasaclas prepares graduates who, while risking their own lives, take on a sensotement to perform tasks that will undoubtedly help protect Ukraine.
I recently dismissed the deputy commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. At one time, we were a unit of the US Armed Forces, which supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine from February to December 2022. The armeds of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine were incredibly impressed by us.
In 2000, more than 23 years ago, I participated in one of the first exercises with the program "Partnership for Peace" in the west of Ukraine, near Lviv, he drew for joint strategic planning together with the then commander of the Armed Forces, Colonel Ivan Yakubts. For me, this was a good experience. Comparing the condition of your army then and now, I am amazed at how much the armed forces of Ukraine have strengthened, in particular, thanks to such co -wanders as you.
More than 35 years ago, I graduated from the Academy in the West Point. Among the Academy's immigrants, there is a belief that if the release ceremony rains, the graduates will be war. In our case, the belief has come true. For more than five years, he managed the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also answered for planning the actions of the combined command of special operations of the efficiency of the deployment in these countries. He also performed the duties of the battalion and brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division, the first Ranger battalion and the 10th Mountain Division Commander.
I acknowledge that I did not have such combat experience as the one that is obtained in Ukraine, however, I am deeply convinced that there are inviolability that commanders should possess:* be technically aware. Commanders should be experts in their field;
The world is not in place, as well as the challenges we face. Commanders should be open to new knowledge, master new tactics, technologies of Tastrategy. The training should be continuous.
And most importantly, commanders should be true to their country and always hold their word. The devotion and purpose of military service should not be in doubt.
Your main motivation should be to protect and defend the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. In difficult times, military duty and protection of your country are the main call. You are all doing right if you enjoy the time spent on the service. Be careful to the servicemen and educate the subordinates who will appreciate your command qualities.
The power of the army is in its unity. Successful completion of the task is always a common mate.
Finally, take the time to remember those who served us to be sacrificial immune and invaluable experience of which is now an important lesson for us. Honor them do their best to preserve the principles they fought for. I will consider that you will be guided by these tips during your service. Beat, strong and worthy.
Thank you for the opportunity to greet you. I really admire you!Good health to you!I pray that one day in Ukraine there will be peace.
