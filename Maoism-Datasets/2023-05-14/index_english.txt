 President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine will be ready to start a contradiction after completion of weapons and favorable weather conditions.
He said this in an interview .
“First of all, we do not plan a counter -offensive for months. For us, this is a priority, so we had to prepare with our plans in advance ... Emphasis on a number of directions. The first question is, of course, ammunition. I'm saying this as a priority not because I want to complain, but because it is a resource without which a counter -offensive is impossible. But I want to clearly say that without this resource, the defense of the state is impossible, ”he said.
Zelensky stressed that it is not just a matter of counter -offensive. The question is to hold a counter -offensive and not lose the territories we have.
“Despite being stronger - I think we are more motivated than . However, we must all prepare, be provided with weapons and motivated people, so as not to lose people. Therefore, the most important thing we need is resources for those plans that have already been drawn up. Honestly, the weather is also affected by the weather. This is an absolute fact, because, for example, the land must be suitable for our weapon. We do not have such a wide range of armored vehicles, ”Zelensky said.
According to him, for the military-political command of Ukraine, one of the patterned tasks is to minimize human losses. “Our main tactics of the outset of the war and even before the war - then it was not a tactic, but my way to people - we must control our entire territory, but the scaffolding to save as many people as possible. During the war, our tactic has changed ... We understand that despite the counter -offensive - and we will do it - Mipovin is minimizing losses. And so when we say that it is necessary, we need everything that allows us to protect people - artillery systems and a long -range artillery, ”the President said.
He added that Ukraine will be ready for a counter -offensive after the weapons are completed. “As soon as the supply of weapons, which has been expected with our partners, we will be ready for a counter -offensive, of course, by the degree of change in weather. And the goal is unchanged - the de -occupation of our territory, ”Zelensky said. Read also: NATO He also emphasized the need for modern aviation for the full liberation of the territories of Ukraine. “Now we are lost in the sky. We always say that the force of the Russian Federation outweighs the power of the Russian Federation. I believe that we are also motivated by Russia. On the battlefield, on Earth we showed what they were capable of. But we are absolutely intelligent people. If they have an absolute advantage in the sky, so it is. And that our partnerships do it. We would like to get their support to give us a fighter-toe sample, usually F-16. There are other fighters, eurofighter and more. Error names. We work with everyone to get something in this field, ”said Zemnsky.

 Presidential Divine Zelensky said that Ukraine will be ready to start a counter -offset after completion of weapons supplies and favorable weather conditions.
He said this in an interview .
“First of all, we do not plan a counter -offensive for months. For us, this is a priority, so we had to prepare with our plans in advance ... Emphasis on a number of directions. The first question is, of course, ammunition. I'm saying this as a priority not because I want to complain, but because it is a resource without which a counter -offensive is impossible. But I want to clearly say that without this resource, the defense of the state is impossible, ”he said.
Zelensky stressed that it is not just a matter of counter -offensive. The question is to hold a counter -offensive and not lose the territories we have.
“Despite being stronger - I think we are more motivated than . However, we must all prepare, be provided with weapons and motivated people, so as not to lose people. Therefore, the most important thing we need is resources for those plans that have already been drawn up. Honestly, the weather is also affected by the weather. This is an absolute fact, because, for example, the land must be suitable for our weapon. We do not have such a wide range of armored vehicles, ”Zelensky said.
According to him, for the military-political command of Ukraine, one of the patterned tasks is to minimize human losses. “Our main tactics of the outset of the war and even before the war - then it was not a tactic, but my way to people - we must control our entire territory, but the scaffolding to save as many people as possible. During the war, our tactic has changed ... We understand that despite the counter -offensive - and we will do it - Mipovin is minimizing losses. And so when we say that it is necessary, we need everything that allows us to protect people - artillery systems and a long -range artillery, ”the President said.
He added that Ukraine will be ready for a counter -offensive after the weapons are completed. “As soon as the supply of weapons, which has been expected with our partners, we will be ready for a counter -offensive, of course, by the degree of change in weather. And the goal is unchanged - the de -occupation of our territory, ”Zelensky said. Read also: NATO He also emphasized the need for modern aviation for the full liberation of the territories of Ukraine. “Now we are lost in the sky. We always say that the force of the Russian Federation outweighs the power of the Russian Federation. I believe that we are also motivated by Russia. On the battlefield, on Earth we showed what they were capable of. But we are absolutely intelligent people. If they have an absolute advantage in the sky, so it is. And that our partnerships do it. We would like to get their support to give us a fighter-toe sample, usually F-16. There are other fighters, eurofighter and more. Error names. We work with everyone to get something in this field, ”said Zemnsky.
As reported , at a press conference with Federal Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Solz, President Vladimir Zelensky has argued that he believed in the success of the future counter -offensive of the Ukrainian forces.

 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is convinced that the current leader of the aggressor state Vladimir Putin with his residence as the president with his policy is increasingly isolating the Russian Federation of the Required World. The head of the Ukrainian state said this in interviewing the representatives of the Italian media during an official visit to Italy.
“It is right now from the Russia that had ties with the civilized world. It is isolated today. With his presence in the Kremlin, he isolates people, his economy, his history, his language. Everything that was accumulated in them is Winter. And it erased our relationship, because he came to us with his aggression, unprovoked war, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
The President of Ukraine expressed his belief that the Russian leader is indifferent to people - not only Ukrainians, but also citizens of his country - that is why Russian troops who have come to Ukrainian land have been demanding since the beginning of this Zaporbnitsa.
“He does not have a strong army. He has millions of people he throws up. And he had a lot of Soviet technology, ”the Head of State said.
Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the Kremlin head has less justification for his actions in Ukraine. The current President of Russia is less believed to be a society, business and even environment.
“He promised them a quick victory, and there was no victory. Everything is comprehensive, no one communicates with these people, serious business comes from the Russian Federation, businesses in Europe and the world where there is a partnership of Russia, do not want to have joint contracts. All this affects a large number of people, and they do not want it, because they have difficulty every day ... This is isolation, ” - said state.
At the same time, according to Vladimir Zelensky, Russian society is contagious as it was under the Soviet Union, and it is not ready to live visuals again, so it will press on the President of the Russian Federation.
“Every day the mood there, within the state, is deteriorating. They will press it, ”the President of Ukraine said.
The Head of State stressed that Ukraine is approaching victory, while pushing the enemy from its territory. In particular, he noted that our country is extremely thoroughly preparing for a counter -offensive.
“We are preparing very seriously. And very serious steps will be a must. I know that we are all motivated - not only those who know all this idea, but our people, ”Volodymyr Zelenskyy added.The President emphasized that the Ukrainian people believed in victory, and the first important quotes will be soon.

 Victory for Ukraine is not only the liberation from the Russian invaders of all territories, but also to bring a crime of aggression against our country to just responsibility of all guilty. This was stated by President Vladimirzelensky in an interview with the representatives of the Italian media during the official business card of Italy.
Answering the question, the head of the Ukrainian state noted that one of the only pacification of the Ukrainian territories will be not enough for those citizens, which have lost their children.
"I know the people who said, addressing me," I awarded their children in a way ... They said: "We are very much asking you: not only our native land. Improve. Those who gave orders should answer. We want the court. It was designed by the court - we want real justice. We demand it, we will not sleep. " These are the old people who hid their young children who went over and died for the sake of the state, ”he said.
Therefore, according to Vladimir Zelensky, both for these people and for him as a president of Ukraine, victory is not only a return of territories.
“We are a civilized state and we want peace, but just peace. Is the right, honest sentences to the killers, ”the President emphasized.
He also noted that aggression from the Russian Federation may be different - not only in appearance, but also blackmail, including energy. The Head of State expresses that in the case of losing Ukraine in the war, Russian aggression will continue to be resolved to NATO and the European Union, and then the public states will have to send their children and parents to the war.
“I am ready for a pragmatic conversation. I think your society should be ready to know: it is better to help Ukraine, ”said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

 ** _ On the eve of May 9, the so-called talk shows dedicated to the "great victory of the great Russian people in the Great Patriotic War" took place on the Russian TV. What and how they talked there will not be rewriting, because it is so all -to -do. I will only say that the Kremlin propagandists did not bypass such sensitive as the extermination during the war of the Jewish population. Especially on the territory of Ukraine, where, according to the propagandists, "there were very many Jews."
“For the salvation of Jews shot and babies…” 
During the Holocaust, Ukraine lost 1.5 million Jews - a quarter of the 6 million Jews of Europe. The rescuers of the Jews were not only ethnic Ukrainians, but also representatives of other nationalities in Ukraine: Poles, Russians, Belarusians, Crimean Tatars, Armenians, Greeks, Germans, representatives of various religious denominations. These people showed humanity despite the fact that the death penalties were threatened not only by the imprisoners, but also for their children, members of their families.
However, from the speeches of the participants of these talk shows, it was the Ukrainians who "were distinguished by the animal about this ancient people, not only giving people to the Germans, but Imasov's own shot." Machine? What else!But the scum, journalism, if it exists in Russia, these words are encountered. In short, the Muscovites accuse Ukrainians of all the terrible Grykhi, inventing these "sins" in their sick heads. But any gunman knows that Ukrainians have massively rescued Jews from death. And not only Ukrainian: in other occupied countries, people also helped them to prevent death. But in the occupied territory of Ukraine, the help of Jews was much more dangerous than in the countries of Western Europe, occupied by Nazi Germany, since the Nazis destroyed not only the person who helped but also his whole family.

На медалі, якою нагороджують Праведників народів світу,влучно наголошується: «Той, хто рятує одне життя, рятує весь світ».Переконані, що спільними зусиллями всіх і кожного буде забезпечено порятунокцивілізаційних демократичних цінностей від зазіхань агресивного режиму кремля,— зазначають в МЗС.

 Thank you very much. 
_ for me great honor to be here. _
_ Mrs. Mayor, Mr. Linden! _
_ Dear Olafe, Road Ursulo, Mateushe, Roberto! _
Dear colleagues! 
Thank you very much for your kind words about Ukraine and our heroes, our soldiers of our children. Thank you very much!They are real heroes. Thank you for Europe, which is finally a dream that was the basis of European community!
It is a great honor for me - to represent the Ukrainian people here and daily. Millions of people who fight and work for the sake of our values and freedom and thezarada of our free Europe. All Ukrainians, each of our heroes deserve to stand here and receive this award.
But, since millions of people simply will not fit in this hall, let us now sound our language that represents our people.
In these walls, the Ukrainian language never sounded from the mouth of the awarded. From now on, when Ukraine returns to its native European House, I believe that the Ukrainian language will sound repeatedly here - as a sign of recognition of specialized in European unity.
Ukrainians will always make Europe stronger!
Everyone who is present in this hall is all who, together with us, defend the freedom of Taigrop - all of us are more than leaders and politicians, public figures and diplomats. All we are the founders of peace. It is the founders of peace. This is our main obligation to our countries, before our Europe and our history.
It is peace that we will leave our children and grandchildren as the inheritance of today. We don't have no other alternatives. But in order to inherit peace, we are with you to come to the day when we can say that we are completing this with a joint victory.
_ Dear Europeans! _
The story is built from victories, though he remembers the defeat. There were illusions that have been possible with other bricks for history than victories, but such illusions were disappeared or, in the better, many years of silence in the stories who confessed them. Illusions rotate with deaths.
The world of our parents generation is the peace that they were inherited by those who have a great aggression in Europe. And the world of our generation with you children is the peace that we are now in the battles against the last aggression of the Uevrop.
Fighting lasts more than 2000 kilometers from here, from Aachen - on Earth of Ukraine, in our sky, in our Black Sea ... and in the European fate. This field is the fate of Europe.We have encountered an aggressor that goes to any cruelty and meanness to state that the story is not changing ... Allegedly, as it was once, and again. Allegedly who has power-that will have the territory, any, the Yakagressor wants. Allegedly, anyone is capable of more meanness, more and more of the rights of Naevrop. Allegedly civilization is worth nothing - that's what is manifested by this genocidic aggression.
We have encountered an aggressor for which our common European desire of the domir and rules weighs nothing and who wants Europe to do with what a good free nation will disagree, no conscientious leader, none of those present in this hall.
We are one in the fact that Europe and all other parts of the Earth should not be a place where the ambitions of tyrants break the lives of peoples.
And we must be the winners to look at you with the view of life.
_ Dear Europe! _
Ukraine offers you a victory that will turn peace and save you.
Ukraine offers victory not just in one this war, but over the aggression of Janesions, burning of cities, deportations, over the catastrophe of genocide anywhere. We offer and bring a common victory over the one who has received the whole old evil from the pages of the past to destroy our future, which we all dream of all for our children.
Russia, on its own volition, has embarked on the path of evil. Our will with you is enough to delete this path and the path of any of the same aggressors that may ever be repeated by Russia.
We will accomplish this task. But only together!
_ DONE OLFE! _
I turn to you right now and because of you I turn to all your state - to a powerful Germany.
Ukraine and the whole of Europe - we honor your choice - to be for Europe, to be Zevropo. When you saw ZeitenWende, you started acting as it should act as a European defensefielder.
Europe will always be grateful to you and this government in Germany.
I am grateful for the efficiency in helping Ukraine, for your and your colleagues, the efficiency of your country's overalls and for the power you and all Germany give to Europe.
The brilliant German "Iris", which has already saved thousands of lives of our people of sprouting rocket terror. Powerful German "Marders" help to protect the life of our soldiers when they press on Russian invaders. Strong German "leopards" give us the necessary protection.
And it is very important that Germany helps not only militarically, but also its leadership in the economy, in the humanitarian sphere, in diplomacy.This Russian aggression continues on our land. And it is our people who die daily with the evil that, by beating Ukraine, beating the idea of peaceful Europe, in the very idea of an international order based on the rules.
We see this evil aggression closest, so we see the best way to defeat Caeslo, how to prevent his replication in other parts of the world or at other times. We invite the world to join our just and honest principles.
Anyone who joins our formula actually makes it their own. And it is declared that the Ukrainian formula of peace can become a German formula of peace, the European formula of peace, the formula of peace for the world.
Only one who does not perceive it is the aggressor. And that is why he does not accept that he is an aggressor. But the most important thing is that he is one, and we are not afraid of him. And he does not accept it because he is not interested in peace. That's all.
Hundreds of rounds of negotiations between 2014 and 2022 in various formats with Russia after occupying our Ukrainian Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea and the ignition of a hybridwar against Ukraine in the Donbass - all these negotiations were.
And you, Olafe, Mr. Chancellor, you remember, and our ally, President Emmanuelmakron, and other conscientious world leaders have spent hours in Zuputin's conversations, trying to distract this modern catastrophe.
But Putin chose a catastrophe. He is alone.
Now everyone understands what we understand. Putin is a catastrophe. This is the answer. Putin is aggression, and he does not want for himself and his people. Its formula was a death.
How to talk to her, explain to me how to talk to her? For all its long, humanity has not yet known anyone who could agree with death.
Anyone who has brought death is the one who has embarrassed genocide, the one who wants to destroy the noun, who wants to destroy the Europe we value, has to ask for mercy. And then the Budenha answer is the tribunal.
Our determination with you will lead to what we will see from Russia a wonder in our efforts for the sake of peace. And it will be. When there was no death.
We are able to win!And we are already approaching the victory, and this has repeatedly been evidence of the joy of children and adults, women, men, young people and people of respect, which our warriors released from the Russian occupation. Everywhere where our blue and yellow flag returns, Europe returns. Our Europe is returning with you!The values that you are - as we have protected on our Maidans and recorded in our constitutions are returned.That is why it is important to be firm and decisive in helping the weapons of Ukrainian people.
Very often, in particular here, in Aachen, during the presentation of this respectable award, it was said that Europe should become one of the world Superpowers. Unlike such forces, Europe has this potential only when not something else, the European unity of European unity becomes SuperPower. And we see it now: SuperPower ofeuropean Unity. We see thanks to Ukraine and each and every one of you.
Your solidarity and leadership, expensive colleagues, including your solidarity, Ursulo, which EU responded to our courage, have become a reflection of the basic principles that were sought for Europe by Robert Shuman, Iconrad Adenauer, and Jean Monet. They would be proud of everyone and every one who protects Europe with Ukraine!
Ukrainian courage and your solidarity gave Europe the unity that was over.
It is time to record such a power of our unity by the decision on Ukraine's accession of the Pre -European Union. You know that Europe is not complete without Ukraine with an Evrosius. And I thank you, Olafe, I thank every European leader who supports the European project.
There is no rational reason why our warriors, who are so heroically fighting for our common freedom, our common values, are in one organization with all other Alliance warriors.
If you judge the fruits of our actions, Ukraine is already in the Alliance, but there is no decision that has not been made. It is worth making this decision!And it is worth defining the algorithm - it motivates our warriors. And that's important!
In addition to strengthening the entire Euro -Atlantic with the courage of Ukrainians, our accession to Dalians will definitely give another historical result - NATO flags near Ukraine on our eastern border will become the powerful castle of o m, which will keep Russian imperialism in the past. In the past, which is not turned, because without controlling Ukraine, Russian imperialism dies.
And another prerequisite for our common victory offered by Ukraine.
The longest peace and most reliable security of Europe has ensured the construction of relations with European international relations instead of barriers.
And when we see now instead of strengthening our connections, any fresh bubbles that are so reminiscent of old mistakes-whether barriers in politics, whether tobarriers in economics, in trade-then we see a threat not to one European nation, but all that Europe.
_ Mateushe! _ I thank you very much for the great support of Ukraine by Poland. Thank you very much!And it is very important for us to maintain this unity._ Dear are present! _
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Today, I only spoke about what is needed for our common victory, but, just what is needed for a sustainable peace for all of us.
I dream that Europe will be the winner!I know that Ukrainians can win!I will be won with us with us, with the Ukrainians!
This time has come!Right now, what will be the end of this war and in fact it is the last aggression in Europe.
It all depends on our unity with you, on our speed with you, on our connection for the setting for victory.
So my main appeal to you today: be worthy of Karlavyliko!Win!
Establish the peace that will be the fruit of our common victory and what we will grow to our children with, our grandchildren as our main legacy with you, inheritance!
And if someone still has doubts about whether the Ukrainian people please here, in Aachen, or in any other city of our precious free Europe, go out, please look around the street, feel the main thing we want , what give us all peace and respect in Europe. Feel the freedom that is just here!
And we are fighting for her. And let's win.
Glory to all our soldiers, who is in battle today for the sake of Ukraine, on combat postacht on combat missions!
Glory to all who train Ukrainian soldiers!
Glory to everyone who helps, who works, who is fighting!
Ukraine will win!Europe will win!
The world will win!

 Thank you very much. 
_ for me great honor to be here. _
_ Mrs. Mayor, Mr. Linden! _
_ Dear Olafe, Road Ursulo, Mateushe, Roberto! _
Dear colleagues! 
Thank you very much for your kind words about Ukraine and our heroes, our soldiers of our children. Thank you very much!They are real heroes. Thank you for Europe, which is finally a dream that was the basis of European community!
It is a great honor for me - to represent the Ukrainian people here and daily. Millions of people who fight and work for the sake of our values and freedom and thezarada of our free Europe. All Ukrainians, each of our heroes deserve to stand here and receive this award.
But, since millions of people simply will not fit in this hall, let us now sound our language that represents our people.
In these walls, the Ukrainian language never sounded from the mouth of the awarded. From now on, when Ukraine returns to its native European House, I believe that the Ukrainian language will sound repeatedly here - as a sign of recognition of specialized in European unity.
Ukrainians will always make Europe stronger!
Everyone who is present in this hall is all who, together with us, defend the freedom of Taigrop - all of us are more than leaders and politicians, public figures and diplomats. All we are the founders of peace. It is the founders of peace. This is our main obligation to our countries, before our Europe and our history.
It is peace that we will leave our children and grandchildren as the inheritance of today. We don't have no other alternatives. But in order to inherit peace, we are with you to come to the day when we can say that we are completing this with a joint victory.
_ Dear Europeans! _
The story is built from victories, though he remembers the defeat. There were illusions that have been possible with other bricks for history than victories, but such illusions were disappeared or, in the better, many years of silence in the stories who confessed them. Illusions rotate with deaths.
The world of our parents generation is the peace that they were inherited by those who have a great aggression in Europe. And the world of our generation with you children is the peace that we are now in the battles against the last aggression of the Uevrop.
Fighting lasts more than 2000 kilometers from here, from Aachen - on Earth of Ukraine, in our sky, in our Black Sea ... and in the European fate. This field is the fate of Europe.We have encountered an aggressor that goes to any cruelty and meanness to state that the story is not changing ... Allegedly, as it was once, and again. Allegedly who has power-that will have the territory, any, the Yakagressor wants. Allegedly, anyone is capable of more meanness, more and more of the rights of Naevrop. Allegedly civilization is worth nothing - that's what is manifested by this genocidic aggression.
We have encountered an aggressor for which our common European desire of the domir and rules weighs nothing and who wants Europe to do with what a good free nation will disagree, no conscientious leader, none of those present in this hall.
We are one in the fact that Europe and all other parts of the Earth should not be a place where the ambitions of tyrants break the lives of peoples.
And we must be the winners to look at you with the view of life.
_ Dear Europe! _
Ukraine offers you a victory that will turn peace and save you.
Ukraine offers victory not just in one this war, but over the aggression of Janesions, burning of cities, deportations, over the catastrophe of genocide anywhere. We offer and bring a common victory over the one who has received the whole old evil from the pages of the past to destroy our future, which we all dream of all for our children.
Russia, on its own volition, has embarked on the path of evil. Our will with you is enough to delete this path and the path of any of the same aggressors that may ever be repeated by Russia.
We will accomplish this task. But only together!
_ DONE OLFE! _
I turn to you right now and because of you I turn to all your state - to a powerful Germany.
Ukraine and the whole of Europe - we honor your choice - to be for Europe, to be Zevropo. When you saw ZeitenWende, you started acting as it should act as a European defensefielder.
Europe will always be grateful to you and this government in Germany.
I am grateful for the efficiency in helping Ukraine, for your and your colleagues, the efficiency of your country's overalls and for the power you and all Germany give to Europe.
The brilliant German "Iris", which has already saved thousands of lives of our people of sprouting rocket terror. Powerful German "Marders" help to protect the life of our soldiers when they press on Russian invaders. Strong German "leopards" give us the necessary protection.
And it is very important that Germany helps not only militarically, but also its leadership in the economy, in the humanitarian sphere, in diplomacy.This Russian aggression continues on our land. And it is our people who die daily with the evil that, by beating Ukraine, beating the idea of peaceful Europe, in the very idea of an international order based on the rules.
We see this evil aggression closest, so we see the best way to defeat Caeslo, how to prevent his replication in other parts of the world or at other times. We invite the world to join our just and honest principles.
Anyone who joins our formula actually makes it their own. And it is declared that the Ukrainian formula of peace can become a German formula of peace, the European formula of peace, the formula of peace for the world.
Only one who does not perceive it is the aggressor. And that is why he does not accept that he is an aggressor. But the most important thing is that he is one, and we are not afraid of him. And he does not accept it because he is not interested in peace. That's all.
Hundreds of rounds of negotiations between 2014 and 2022 in various formats with Russia after occupying our Ukrainian Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea and the ignition of a hybridwar against Ukraine in the Donbass - all these negotiations were.
And you, Olafe, Mr. Chancellor, you remember, and our ally, President Emmanuelmakron, and other conscientious world leaders have spent hours in Zuputin's conversations, trying to distract this modern catastrophe.
But Putin chose a catastrophe. He is alone.
Now everyone understands what we understand. Putin is a catastrophe. This is the answer. Putin is aggression, and he does not want for himself and his people. Its formula was a death.
How to talk to her, explain to me how to talk to her? For all its long, humanity has not yet known anyone who could agree with death.
Anyone who has brought death is the one who has embarrassed genocide, the one who wants to destroy the noun, who wants to destroy the Europe we value, has to ask for mercy. And then the Budenha answer is the tribunal.
Our determination with you will lead to what we will see from Russia a wonder in our efforts for the sake of peace. And it will be. When there was no death.
We are able to win!And we are already approaching the victory, and this has repeatedly been evidence of the joy of children and adults, women, men, young people and people of respect, which our warriors released from the Russian occupation. Everywhere where our blue and yellow flag returns, Europe returns.
