The Ministry of Health is advised to make sure that there is potassium iodide in the first aid kit that is useful to reduce the negative impact of radioactive iodine into the thyroid in the event of a nuclear object.
** It is necessary to take the required dose of potassium iodide only after official airborne!
“It is optimal to take the drug after alerting for 6 or less hours of overcoming a radioactive cloud, but potassium iodide remains effective with the receipt of the cloud and 6 hours after it. Not recommended administration of the drug 24 hours after the cloud is received, ”the message goes.

“The first thing we need to understand in conclusions(Venice Commission - Ed.)Recommendations are provided. Ukraine does not feel obliged to respond to an abbey manner in connection with these recommendations, ”the government said.
Commenting on the recommendation of the Venice Commission on the need to renew "privileged status" for the Russian language after the completion of "extraordinary situation", ie war with the Russian Federation, Stefanyshyn She noted that in the opinion of the Ukrainian side, "it is a large -scale loss for the body itself."
“We do not consider it possible to do this discussion in the plane of some legal nuances at all. In Ukraine, the rights of all national minorities are fully ensured. Deep, obviously, you do not have to immerse yourself here in a question concerning the Russian national minority. I want to pay attention to - in Ukraine a non -organized Russian national minority, ”Viceremierka emphasized.
She recalled that the Russian Federation had never defended the rights of the Russian minority, they always spoke of "Russian -nakedness", which should be "protected".
“And in fact, the Venice Commission came out of this Russian narrative. The deepening of us is such an unpleasant story. There is a certain constitutional nuance here, every constitution provides that the free development of Russian and other spots is ensured. The Constitution was approved in the 96th year, with this wording, when memorandums, contracts and CIS, 6 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Derosian language was state. This reality, obviously, in war, we can not change the constitution and so on. All this was explained. It is obvious that this context was to be taken into account, ”Stephanishina said.

 Presidentrf Volodymyr Putin was not true that in the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations, he was allegedly signed a peace agreement in Istanbul in 2022, but Ukrainian abandoned it.
This was stated by the leader of the Crimean Tatar people Mustafa Dzhemilev during the ceremony of raising the Crimean Tatar flag near the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, reported by Ukrinform.
“A few days ago, the Kremlin dictator Putin, in front of the heads of the College of African countries, said that in March 2022, a peace agreement was signed in Istanbul in March 2022, and it has terminated and continued its hostilities. Of course, Putin in the usual manner was brazenly lied. I say this responsibly because it was administered at the final part of the talks in Turkey. In fact, we passed on to the Russian side as a condition for the termination of hostilities with the position of the border departed as of February 24. And on the issues of Crimea and the Donbass, the process begins, pledging not to use the force to release these territories. But the next day after the negotiations, Putin stated that there could be no negotiations about Crimea, because it is a territory of Russia, ”Dzhemilev said.

“I see that her post disposes of actions, with what she told me. She is not respected by my position because she asked about money . As for her behavior, the fact that I was handed by my hand, I will say that no person should treat the other person so much, ”Kharkiv said.
Darina thanked the people who expressed her support during a single pile.
“Yes, Loboda's supporters were much more, but there were those who supported me. And I am grateful to these people, ”the girl said.

“Case Loboda, it's first and foremost about two things - money and reputation. In the world and the headwar, everything is spinning around money, more precisely the grandmothers. There is nothing else in her head. Values and freedom - for her fictional things for "suckers". It would be so -mobility, but rather the need for PR on Russian television, she would simply ask the Maidani "Who gave you money?" And in that head nothing has changed. And second. Yes, there is no reputation institute in Ukraine. But also to create it finally. You liked to make money in Russia, well, then and work there. Do you "idle in what country lives"? Well, then Ukraine is kicked. And the last. Do not pull this quinoa either in Kharkiv or in the Dnieper, any city in Ukraine.

 Organization “Media Initiative for Human Rights”(Mplex)The murder of two teenagers in Berdyansk is still unknown, but according to her information they were killed by sniper shots.
About it in Facebook MIPP reported, Ukrinform reports.
“For a few days we have been analyzing the situation and thinking that we, the legal organization, the state of Ukraine and the international community could do to prevent this tragedy. So far, we do not have a response to a cure. Moreover, we are still unknown all the circumstances that led to the death of the honors, ”the message reads.
The organization does not exclude that the occupation investigation could intimidate the boys to provoke them to escape and armed detention. Currently, Mipps thinks that the guys could be killed intentionally.
“The occupying bodies could have made efforts to preserve the lives of teenagers, but did not happen. For example, during the "investigative actions" the investigative committee of the statement of Oghannysyan and Khanganova attracted dozens of security forces. Instead, according to our information, Tigran and Nikita were killed by sniper shots, ”the organizations said.
It is noted that occupation power Berdyansk He claims that their murder allegedly occurred as a result of an attack on the "police", which was made by Tigran and Nikita. Information from open sources own sources of MIPP confirms that a shootout in Berdyansk in the evening was really. However, there have not been any confirmations about the victims of the average, which the invaders emphasized. This incident is further investigating and clarifying all the circumstances.
At the same time, the organization emphasizes the importance of context and events, which was overwhelmed by the killing of teenagers.
Since September 2022, Tigran and Nikita, as well as their families have been persecuted by the Russian occupation authorities. The Tigran was stolen from home, for five days they were bouncing and mocking it. He was released only after the announcement of the child to whom the parents succeeded. The family also tried to take out the occupation, but the occupiers arrested the boy and parents and returned to the occupied Berdyansk.In the last few weeks, the pressure has increased. Investigators announced the teenage to prepare a sabotage and planned to transfer the case to court. The investigator arrived in Tigran, but Tigran, together with Nikita fled from home and hid, came to the murder of Tigran. At that time, Tigran called a mother who was in Germany with younger children, asked to help. The boys needed help, but could not find it in a drowsy city.
In the morning on the day of the tragedy of Nikita and Tigran returned home. Immediately the investigator came to them. In the evening, the boys two went out for a walk in the city.

According to her, he was calm and said that 21:00 plans to be at home. In general, it was clear from the conversation that he was expecting to meet with his family, had plans for the future and, apparently, on his own initiative would take a risky action.
“Further events unfolded, we do not know exactly. However, we can assume that Tigran and Nikita were brought to the pressure of the pelvication of the occupying power and, as it seemed, the hopeless situation in which the people found themselves, ”the IPP said
The Media Initiative for Human Rights considers Berdyansk, specifically the senior investigative department of the investigative department of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Khusinev IR, as well as the leadership of the Investigative Committee, which, in the opinion and above the military-political leadership of the Russian Federation.
MIPP also does not remove responsibility from international organizations, the Red Cross and the UN International Committee, to which the European Parliament appeared in its resolution the day before, calling to intervene in the situation around the teenage and facilitate their departure into the territory controlled by government. No reaction to this call happened.
Currently, MIPP is expected to increase the pressure and persecution of Tigran Tamykita's loved ones by the occupying power. Therefore, the intervention of the international community, in particular, is relevant.As it was reported, in the occupied Berdyansk invaders declared ["liquidation of two pro -Ukrainian terrorists"]](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3727376-zagarbniki-kazut-so-vbili-u-berdansku-dvoh-proukrainskih-teroristiv.html). One of them is 16-year-old Tigran Ogannisyan. Miple notes that the other is killed - Nikita Khanganov.
The network publishes the last video recorded by Tigran. On it the guy says, "All, it's death, a guy. Farewell. Glory to Ukraine". Then the recording breaks.
Tigran Ogannisian invaders They were stolen in September 2022. He was accused of terrorism with another teenager, Nikita Khanganov. They were threatened with 20 years.
The European Parliament in June this year demanded from the Russian authorities To stop the process against children and allow them to go to a controlled Ukrainian territory.

 Greetings to the graduates of the Taras Shevchenko Military Institute, Braian Menness, a maider-Major of Liberty Fort, the United States Armed Forces.
I want to express my gratitude to the brigade General Anatoliishevchenko for the opportunity to share with you a few tips, as Vasaclas prepares graduates who, while risking their own lives, take on a sensotement to perform tasks that will undoubtedly help protect Ukraine.
I recently dismissed the deputy commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. At one time, we were a unit of the US Armed Forces, which supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine from February to December 2022. The armeds of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine were incredibly impressed by us.
In 2000, more than 23 years ago, I participated in one of the first exercises with the program "Partnership for Peace" in the west of Ukraine, near Lviv, he drew for joint strategic planning together with the then commander of the Armed Forces, Colonel Ivan Yakubts. For me, this was a good experience. Comparing the condition of your army then and now, I am amazed at how much the armed forces of Ukraine have strengthened, in particular, thanks to such co -wanders as you.
More than 35 years ago, I graduated from the Academy in the West Point. Among the Academy's immigrants, there is a belief that if the release ceremony rains, the graduates will be war. In our case, the belief has come true. For more than five years, he managed the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also answered for planning the actions of the combined command of special operations of the efficiency of the deployment in these countries. He also performed the duties of the battalion and brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division, the first Ranger battalion and the 10th Mountain Division Commander.
I acknowledge that I did not have such combat experience as the one that is obtained in Ukraine, however, I am deeply convinced that there are inviolability that commanders should possess:* be technically aware. Commanders should be experts in their field;
The world is not in place, as well as the challenges we face. Commanders should be open to new knowledge, master new tactics, technologies of Tastrategy. The training should be continuous.
And most importantly, commanders should be true to their country and always hold their word. The devotion and purpose of military service should not be in doubt.
Your main motivation should be to protect and defend the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. In difficult times, military duty and protection of your country are the main call. You are all doing right if you enjoy the time spent on the service. Be careful to the servicemen and educate the subordinates who will appreciate your command qualities.
The power of the army is in its unity. Successful completion of the task is always a common mate.
Finally, take the time to remember those who served us to be sacrificial immune and invaluable experience of which is now an important lesson for us. Honor them do their best to preserve the principles they fought for. I will consider that you will be guided by these tips during your service. Beat, strong and worthy.
Thank you for the opportunity to greet you. I really admire you!Good health to you!I pray that one day in Ukraine there will be peace.

 About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote In his telegram.
“The task of the Russian Federation is now to stop our offensive at any cost. Blasting of dams, replacement of fields, continuous shelling, diversions, information and even "nuclear" rhetoric. This is a maximum task. The minimum is to stop, then to significantly complicate and slow down our promotion and in the meantime to prepare our own counter -offensive. The motivation to "not lose" the occupied lands will be carried out much more than the motivation to "capture" our lands. Because it is their permanent trauma, ”the message reads.
Anna Malyar noted that the occupiers are psychologically easier to tolerate an unsuccessful effect than the loss of the conquered lands. It demoralizes and demorates them.
“They will then not collect their army themselves, because the fighters, like in Kharkiv region, began to refuse to comply with orders. So we have to understand that. It is really difficult for our war. Very. But they move forward. Confidently. Ajami we wage a just war. And this is our power, ”the deputy minister emphasized.

According to the results of the ratings, three winners were selected who presented the most effective and most effective projects. Each will receive $ 1 million for realization and scaling of technological developments that will help fight Shahmed.
About it reports Government portal.
“In the war, it is important to understand what is happening on the battlefield and to propose technological solutions. We see how the situation on the front changes in direction. How important are UAVs, satellite communications, situational identity systems. The picture of the battle changes. Fast decisions need to be made to realize effective ideas. It is now critically important to create alternative counteraction to Iranian Shahaned. We have cool cases with the army of drones, when not only foreign drones, but also UAVs of domestic production were supplied to the front. Similar to the development of systems of protection of the Ukrainian sky, ”said the Vice Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology-Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.
The winners of the drone hackathon "Anti-Shahed" will conclude contracts for 1 million donors. The funds will go to the development of development as soon as possible, which destroy the wicked drones in the Ukrainian sky. New technologies will help fight stars Shahas so that you do not spend powerful resources for the Air Force.
“In fact, the Ukrainian infrastructure is being attacked by Iranian drones. Only at least 400 Shahaneda has been launched in May. In total, at least 1,200 percussion was launched in Ukraine last year. Ukrainian experts are able to amaze the world and efficiently counteract. Our task is to support the developers, to create speeches for mass production of alternative systems of counteraction to Iranian shivedam, ”-said Oleksandr Kubrakov, Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Ukraine-Minister of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure.That is why it is critical to us to create alternatives to counteracting Iranian shivedam.
“It is important to use not only available weapons, but also new samples of equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our enemy does not sleep and develops a tav perfect its technologies. This also applies to the shamed attack on Ukraine. Each is individual. Therefore, in order to constantly counteract new attacks of UAVs, we need to introduce new systems to identify, identify and destroy goals. I am sure that every idea proposed by Nahaktone has every chance of working for victory, ”Vladimir Koval, General General of Ukraine, said.
The Drone Hackathon "Anti-Shahod" brought together developers, engineers, cyber-specialists and enthusiasts who create advanced systems and technologies to identify, track and destroy enemy drones. Project specialists of different genera and types of troops, military structures and digital technologies were evaluated.
“When a new modern idea is being put into practice, it is an effective surprise for our enemy. According to available information on the territory of Russian, UAV production plants are actively built, and therefore the percentage of new Dronovpovp attacks will increase. With each attack, the enemy analyzes his or her bug works constantly on changing tactics. Therefore, the first thing that can be implemented as quickly as possible is the system of detection of enemy drones and, of course, their prompt destruction, ”said Anatoliy Krivonozhko, Lieutenant General, Commander-General, Commander-in-Chief of the Center.
“Every great war sets new trends in the development of military technologies. First -Ass to create a war of tanks. The second is aviation. This war has shown that the wars of unmanned aerial vehicles will take place at the next decades. That is why we need to create these modern technologies to overcome the enemy on the front today and to protect our territories in the closest, ”said Yuri Shchigol, Head of the State Secretariat of Communications.
We will remind, earlier within the army of drones we have already held the first Drone Hackathon.The 30 formed teams, which presented technological solutions in the development of the BLPL, 6 became winners. In half a year, they embodied their ideas into a product that was repaired at the landfill.
The Drone Hackathon "Anti-Shahed" is implemented on the initiative of the General Staffing Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Infrastructure within the project of the Army project and is aimed at finding innovative and effective solutions in the fight against non-floodstretics.
