<p>However, when returning to the housing that was in a flooded state, you need to follow the following tips:</p>
<p>1 . Before you go to the apartment, evaluate its external integrity. Especially supporting structures and walls. Make sure they are not deformed and safe. When moving the apartment, consider the holes in the floor, broken glass and more.</p>
<p>2 . Be as careful as possible. Do not touch the electrical panels, switches, sockets, if they were not well dried, cleaned and trusted by specialists. In case of switching on, they can be struck by electric current or causing a fire. The same applies to the electrical appliances that remain in the flooded home.</p>
<p><strong> Do not endanger your loved ones: </strong> You can only get back with your children, well -dried and safe housing.</p>
<p><strong> Remember: </strong> to return to the homes that were in the flood area can be more than with the permission of local authorities and emergency response services.</p>

<p>The correspondent of Ukrinform was told by director Akhtem Seitablaev.</p>
<p>"As for Mirny-21, I recently returned from such a pretty international tour. It was Berlin, Warsaw, Brussels, Istrasburg, where the show took place at the Council of Europe Palace. And now we have an invitation from 15 countries. including with commercial shows. And in each country is several cities.

<p>In addition, the result of the cash collection of the movie "Mirny-21" also affected the number of cinemas from the beginning of a full-scale Russian invasion.</p>
<p>"Regarding the cash collection, let's remember the" Mavka " - 150 million hryvnias. This is given that the real cinemas are now, after the large -scale invasion now, 195 is left. By February 24, there were about 600 of them and it was three times less than required for the number of Ukrainian population. And I imagine the person-195 cinemas in the country collect 150 million hryvnias. We can say a decline of Ukrainian boxing office? Of course, not. That is not.

<p>In the appeal to the Russians, Putin put guilty for his rebellion on his organizers, however, without naming their names. These organizers, for the owner of the Kremlin, betrayed Ukraine, the people and "those who were involved in the crime." At the same time, he thanked those "soldiers and commanders" of the Wagner PEC, who stopped at the last border and were not baked on the "brotherly bloodshed".</p>
<p>Putin also thanked the Russian military, law enforcement officers and special services. But the fact that the "Wagnerivtsi" passed more of the path to Moscow, stopping about 200 km from the Russian page.</p>

<p>This was stated by Viceremier-Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Olga Stephanyshyn in an interview <a href="https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/olga-stefanishina-vilnyusi-ukrayini-potribna-1687716936.html">RBC-Ukraine</a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“The first thing we need to understand in conclusions(Venice Commission - Ed.)Recommendations are provided. Ukraine does not feel obliged to respond to an abbey manner in connection with these recommendations, ”the government said.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recommendation of the Venice Commission on the need to renew "privileged status" for the Russian language after the completion of "extraordinary situation", ie war with the Russian Federation, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-stefanisina">Stefanyshyn</a>She noted that in the opinion of the Ukrainian side, "it is a large -scale loss for the body itself."</p>
<p>“We do not consider it possible to do this discussion in the plane of some legal nuances at all. In Ukraine, the rights of all national minorities are fully ensured. Deep, obviously, you do not have to immerse yourself here in a question concerning the Russian national minority. I want to pay attention to - in Ukraine a non -organized Russian national minority, ”Viceremierka emphasized.</p>
<p>She recalled that the Russian Federation had never defended the rights of the Russian minority, they always spoke of "Russian -nakedness", which should be "protected".</p>
<p>“And in fact, the Venice Commission came out of this Russian narrative. The deepening of us is such an unpleasant story. There is a certain constitutional nuance here, every constitution provides that the free development of Russian and other spots is ensured. The Constitution was approved in the 96th year, with this wording, when memorandums, contracts and CIS, 6 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Derosian language was state. This reality, obviously, in war, we can not change the constitution and so on. All this was explained. It is obvious that this context was to be taken into account, ”Stephanishina said.</p>
<p>According to her, each recommendation of the Venice Commission will be discussed.</p>

<p>This was stated by the leader of the Crimean Tatar people Mustafa Dzhemilev during the ceremony of raising the Crimean Tatar flag near the building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, reported by Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“A few days ago, the Kremlin dictator Putin, in front of the heads of the College of African countries, said that in March 2022, a peace agreement was signed in Istanbul in March 2022, and it has terminated and continued its hostilities. Of course, Putin in the usual manner was brazenly lied. I say this responsibly because it was administered at the final part of the talks in Turkey. In fact, we passed on to the Russian side as a condition for the termination of hostilities with the position of the border departed as of February 24. And on the issues of Crimea and the Donbass, the process begins, pledging not to use the force to release these territories. But the next day after the negotiations, Putin stated that there could be no negotiations about Crimea, because it is a territory of Russia, ”Dzhemilev said.</p>

<p>“My compatriots, do not be afraid under pressure, at least in your thoughts, go beyond the imposed framework. And be prepared not only to think, but to stay in favor of our people, ”the address reads.</p>
<p>He expressed confidence that even a superficial analysis of the situation allows the conclusion that the political system in the Crimea enables Crimean Tatars to exist no more than ethnic community with their traditions of Tabasic needs. And not without obstacles and efforts to overcome them, often in vain.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-krimski-tatari">Crimean Tatars</a>They mummify, creating another exhibit of the Museum of the Post -Soviet present, which is Russia today.

<p>“And for me, this choice is simple and understandable. The colors of the Crimean Tatar labor give a clear answer. A long, difficult story of the relations of Ukrainians of Tatars. Joint efforts in the formation of the modern Ukrainian state. And the decisions of the Ukrainian authorities in recent years, as they have been informed, even as intentions, make this choice even more smarter and more correct, ”Jalyalov emphasized.Crimean Tatar flag is a blue -colored cloth with a yellow coat of arms(there)in the upper left corner. Blue is a traditional color of the Turkic peoples, it was used on the Crimean Khanate's flags. The coat of arms-Tarak-tamga(Coat of arms)It is a generic sign of Girey, the leadership of the Crimean Khanate.</p>

<p>The Minister of Veterans of Ukraine Yulia Laputina said about it in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3727870-ulia-laputina-ministerka-u-spravah-veteraniv.html">interview</a><a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3727870-ulia-laputina-ministerka-u-spravah-veteraniv.html">Ukrinform. </a>“When I came to the ministry, there were more than 3,000 families for housing for veterans. And this applies to internal migrants, who became the name of the country at the same time, participants of the ATO, and persons with disabilities as a result of war, and as well as members of the families of the dead. It was a big challenge for me. During the year, 100 apartments were issued, 50 apartments. We had a meeting with both the President of Ukraine and the Department of Minister. The decision was initiated and made to completely close this. Last year, unfortunately, because of a full -scale invasion, this money returned to the defense <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oborona">Defense</a>, but this year we have this money. Of course, I understand that the price of a square meter has changed, but more than 2000 families from these categories, which we have been guilty for many years, will provide housing, ”Laputina assured.</p>
<p>Also, she said, it was possible to buy housing for veterans in the territory of Ukraine, not just at the place of registration.</p>

There is nothing else in her head. Values and freedom - for her fictional things for "suckers". It would be so -mobility, but rather the need for PR on Russian television, she would simply ask the Maidani "Who gave you money?" And in that head nothing has changed. And second. Yes, there is no reputation institute in Ukraine. But also to create it finally. You liked to make money in Russia, well, then and work there. Do you "idle in what country lives"? Well, then Ukraine is kicked. And the last. Do not pull this quinoa either in Kharkiv or in the Dnieper, any city in Ukraine.

<p>Minister of Finance Ukraine Sergey Marchenko told this in an interview for French media Lesechos, Ukrinform reports, citing <a href="https://www.mof.gov.ua/uk/news/vidnovlennia_maie_pochatisia_zaraz_prioritetami_ie_zakhist_energosistemi_ta_povernennia_ukraintsiv_do_domu__sergii_marchenko_v_interviu_dlia_lesechos-4078">press service.</a>"One of our priorities is <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-vidbudova">recovery</a>the energy infrastructure that became the target of Russian attacks, especially at the beginning of the heating season last year. It is estimated that $ 3.3 billion will be consulted to protect energy facilities from missile attacks and drones. This need is extremely urgent, as the energy can be the target of the Russian Federation again, as soon as winter comes, " - said Marchenko.</p>
<p>The second priority of the state, according to him, is housing.</p>
<p>"More than 100,000 dwellings have been destroyed and needed to rebuild $ 1.9 billion. This is important, in particular, for Ukrainian refugees to return home as soon as possible," the Minister said.</p>
<p>The repair of hospitals, schools and other educational institutions is estimated at $ 2.3 billion. Needed for transport and logistics.</p>
<p>"It is important to repair roads and bridges now, to develop communications with the Zevrian Union, because it is the only border that we have left," - said.</p>
<p>He recalled that last week at the London Conference of the Donoriva Country was exposed to allocate 60 billion euros for the restoration of Ukraine, but it was necessary to take into account that at this stage it was only an obligation.</p>

It can take some time, and in some cases even a few years. The problem is that the nashanagal needs are huge, according to the World Bank, they make more than $ 14 billion," Marchenko emphasized.</p>

<p>“For a few days we have been analyzing the situation and thinking that we, the legal organization, the state of Ukraine and the international community could do to prevent this tragedy. So far, we do not have a response to a cure. Moreover, we are still unknown all the circumstances that led to the death of the honors, ”the message reads.</p>
<p>The organization does not exclude that the occupation investigation could intimidate the boys to provoke them to escape and armed detention. Currently, Mipps thinks that the guys could be killed intentionally.</p>
<p>“The occupying bodies could have made efforts to preserve the lives of teenagers, but did not happen. For example, during the "investigative actions" the investigative committee of the statement of Oghannysyan and Khanganova attracted dozens of security forces. Instead, according to our information, Tigran and Nikita were killed by sniper shots, ”the organizations said.</p>
<p>It is noted that occupation power <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-berdansk">Berdyansk</a>He claims that their murder allegedly occurred as a result of an attack on the "police", which was made by Tigran and Nikita. Information from open sources own sources of MIPP confirms that a shootout in Berdyansk in the evening was really. However, there have not been any confirmations about the victims of the average, which the invaders emphasized. This incident is further investigating and clarifying all the circumstances.</p>
<p>At the same time, the organization emphasizes the importance of context and events, which was overwhelmed by the killing of teenagers.</p>
<p>Since September 2022, Tigran and Nikita, as well as their families have been persecuted by the Russian occupation authorities. The Tigran was stolen from home, for five days they were bouncing and mocking it. He was released only after the announcement of the child to whom the parents succeeded. The family also tried to take out the occupation, but the occupiers arrested the boy and parents and returned to the occupied Berdyansk.In the last few weeks, the pressure has increased. Investigators announced the teenage to prepare a sabotage and planned to transfer the case to court. The investigator arrived in Tigran, but Tigran, together with Nikita fled from home and hid, came to the murder of Tigran. At that time, Tigran called a mother who was in Germany with younger children, asked to help. The boys needed help, but could not find it in a drowsy city.</p>
<p>In the morning on the day of the tragedy of Nikita and Tigran returned home. Immediately the investigator came to them. In the evening, the boys two went out for a walk in the city.</p>

<p>Effective destruction of hostile goals - work team and depends on the coordinated work of both calculation and command, aero -intelligence, etc. And, of course, the existing weapons and ammunition, which the guns are now, plays a big role.</p>

<li>We use different types of ammunition, they are all effective. But my profile is the programming of high -precision managed shells M982 Excalibur. And this is a real efficient thing, because it works in the mode "If you flew, then it has hit." I will say that one such shot saves many resources for the Armed Forces: people, shells of other typicals, logistics, and most importantly - time, because the advantage of time in modern war is extremely important, - says "Kozachok".</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-26T55-00-00-04-00/mennes.jpg" />Greetings to the graduates of the Taras Shevchenko Military Institute, Braian Menness, a maider-Major of Liberty Fort, the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>My greetings from Liberty Fort, previously known as Fort Bragg, North, the largest in the world's military base, as well as places in its history and devotion to the values of freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to express my gratitude to the brigade General Anatoliishevchenko for the opportunity to share with you a few tips, as Vasaclas prepares graduates who, while risking their own lives, take on a sensotement to perform tasks that will undoubtedly help protect Ukraine.</p>
<p>I recently dismissed the deputy commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. At one time, we were a unit of the US Armed Forces, which supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine from February to December 2022. The armeds of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine were incredibly impressed by us.</p>
<p>In 2000, more than 23 years ago, I participated in one of the first exercises with the program "Partnership for Peace" in the west of Ukraine, near Lviv, he drew for joint strategic planning together with the then commander of the Armed Forces, Colonel Ivan Yakubts. For me, this was a good experience. Comparing the condition of your army then and now, I am amazed at how much the armed forces of Ukraine have strengthened, in particular, thanks to such co -wanders as you.</p>
<p>More than 35 years ago, I graduated from the Academy in the West Point. Among the Academy's immigrants, there is a belief that if the release ceremony rains, the graduates will be war. In our case, the belief has come true. For more than five years, he managed the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also answered for planning the actions of the combined command of special operations of the efficiency of the deployment in these countries. He also performed the duties of the battalion and brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division, the first Ranger battalion and the 10th Mountain Division Commander.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I did not have such combat experience as the one that is obtained in Ukraine, however, I am deeply convinced that there are inviolability that commanders should possess:* be technically aware. Commanders should be experts in their field;</p>
<ul>
<li>be a real mentor. Commanders must prepare the unit in general, and every serviceman in particular, to ensure the coherence of actions; * be attentive to your subordinates. Commanders should take care of their subordinates more than themselves and treat them as family members; * be honest. In military affairs, honesty is important. Commanders should always be honest, impartial and reliable. Your service comrades will respect you for it; * adhere to the order of subordination. In military business, there is a certain order of subordination and it is important to comply with it. You should take into account the wisdom and experience of senior commanders, as well as always respect the younger ones; * Study continuously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world is not in place, as well as the challenges we face. Commanders should be open to new knowledge, master new tactics, technologies of Tastrategy. The training should be continuous.</p>
<p>And most importantly, commanders should be true to their country and always hold their word. The devotion and purpose of military service should not be in doubt.</p>
<p>Your main motivation should be to protect and defend the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. In difficult times, military duty and protection of your country are the main call. You are all doing right if you enjoy the time spent on the service. Be careful to the servicemen and educate the subordinates who will appreciate your command qualities.</p>
<p>The power of the army is in its unity. Successful completion of the task is always a common mate.</p>
<p>Finally, take the time to remember those who served us to be sacrificial immune and invaluable experience of which is now an important lesson for us. Honor them do their best to preserve the principles they fought for. I will consider that you will be guided by these tips during your service. Beat, strong and worthy.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to greet you. I really admire you!Good health to you!I pray that one day in Ukraine there will be peace.</p>

In general, what is happening there is the censorships of the Russian criminal large -scale invasion of Ukraine.

<p>This was announced on the national telephone by the representative of the main management of intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov.</p>
<ul>
<li>The situation that the situation was destabilized with the events in one day, so many losses in the army of the Russian Federation, demonstrates that all the actually effective forces of them are in the occupied territories of Ukraine. And within Muscovy, the regime controls the situation - the monopoly on violence, destroyed the principle of punishment and many other aspects, - said Gurmou representative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andriy Yusov emphasized that it is important to understand today that this process is still incomplete. The voiced and real goals of Prigogine's campaign to Moscow could differentiate, as well as the voiced and real conditions of arrangements. It is necessary to observe further events, including personnel changes in the territory of the Moscow region, the fate of participants in these processes, then it will become clear who really won it.</p>

<p>“The task of the Russian Federation is now to stop our offensive at any cost. Blasting of dams, replacement of fields, continuous shelling, diversions, information and even "nuclear" rhetoric. This is a maximum task. The minimum is to stop, then to significantly complicate and slow down our promotion and in the meantime to prepare our own counter -offensive. The motivation to "not lose" the occupied lands will be carried out much more than the motivation to "capture" our lands. Because it is their permanent trauma, ”the message reads.</p>
<p>Anna Malyar noted that the occupiers are psychologically easier to tolerate an unsuccessful effect than the loss of the conquered lands. It demoralizes and demorates them.</p>
<p>“They will then not collect their army themselves, because the fighters, like in Kharkiv region, began to refuse to comply with orders. So we have to understand that. It is really difficult for our war. Very. But they move forward. Confidently. Ajami we wage a just war. And this is our power, ”the deputy minister emphasized.</p>

According to the results of the ratings, three winners were selected who presented the most effective and most effective projects. Each will receive $ 1 million for realization and scaling of technological developments that will help fight Shahmed.</p>

<p>“In the war, it is important to understand what is happening on the battlefield and to propose technological solutions. We see how the situation on the front changes in direction. How important are UAVs, satellite communications, situational identity systems. The picture of the battle changes. Fast decisions need to be made to realize effective ideas. It is now critically important to create alternative counteraction to Iranian Shahaned. We have cool cases with the army of drones, when not only foreign drones, but also UAVs of domestic production were supplied to the front. Similar to the development of systems of protection of the Ukrainian sky, ”said the Vice Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology-Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.</p>
<p>The winners of the drone hackathon "Anti-Shahed" will conclude contracts for 1 million donors. The funds will go to the development of development as soon as possible, which destroy the wicked drones in the Ukrainian sky. New technologies will help fight stars Shahas so that you do not spend powerful resources for the Air Force.</p>
<p>“In fact, the Ukrainian infrastructure is being attacked by Iranian drones. Only at least 400 Shahaneda has been launched in May. In total, at least 1,200 percussion was launched in Ukraine last year. Ukrainian experts are able to amaze the world and efficiently counteract. Our task is to support the developers, to create speeches for mass production of alternative systems of counteraction to Iranian shivedam, ”-said Oleksandr Kubrakov, Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Ukraine-Minister of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure.That is why it is critical to us to create alternatives to counteracting Iranian shivedam.</p>
<p>“It is important to use not only available weapons, but also new samples of equipment for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our enemy does not sleep and develops a tav perfect its technologies. This also applies to the shamed attack on Ukraine. Each is individual. Therefore, in order to constantly counteract new attacks of UAVs, we need to introduce new systems to identify, identify and destroy goals. I am sure that every idea proposed by Nahaktone has every chance of working for victory, ”Vladimir Koval, General General of Ukraine, said.</p>
<p>The Drone Hackathon "Anti-Shahod" brought together developers, engineers, cyber-specialists and enthusiasts who create advanced systems and technologies to identify, track and destroy enemy drones. Project specialists of different genera and types of troops, military structures and digital technologies were evaluated.</p>
<p>“When a new modern idea is being put into practice, it is an effective surprise for our enemy. According to available information on the territory of Russian, UAV production plants are actively built, and therefore the percentage of new Dronovpovp attacks will increase. With each attack, the enemy analyzes his or her bug works constantly on changing tactics. Therefore, the first thing that can be implemented as quickly as possible is the system of detection of enemy drones and, of course, their prompt destruction, ”said Anatoliy Krivonozhko, Lieutenant General, Commander-General, Commander-in-Chief of the Center.</p>
<p>“Every great war sets new trends in the development of military technologies. First -Ass to create a war of tanks. The second is aviation. This war has shown that the wars of unmanned aerial vehicles will take place at the next decades. That is why we need to create these modern technologies to overcome the enemy on the front today and to protect our territories in the closest, ”said Yuri Shchigol, Head of the State Secretariat of Communications.</p>
<p>We will remind, earlier within the army of drones we have already held the first Drone Hackathon.The 30 formed teams, which presented technological solutions in the development of the BLPL, 6 became winners. In half a year, they embodied their ideas into a product that was repaired at the landfill.</p>
<p>The Drone Hackathon "Anti-Shahed" is implemented on the initiative of the General Staffing Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Infrastructure within the project of the Army project and is aimed at finding innovative and effective solutions in the fight against non-floodstretics.</p>
