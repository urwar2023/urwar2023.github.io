<p>The White Angel Evacuation Group exports residents on armored cops. To help everyone quickly respond to shelling, police formed additional products.</p>
<p>Evacuation occurs under the coordination of Donetsk ova, also involved in the SES rescuers. About 1900 residents remain in Avdiivka. Most of them live in the private sector in the old part of the city. In addition to the White Angels, the Red Zone is directed by police detachments. The task of law enforcement officers is instant assistance to the population during air strikes and artillery attacks, the number of which has increased significantly.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T58-00-00-04-00/642805cb051c4568278921.jpg" />Avdiivka streets are extinct. People come out of shelters only for food, water. But every way out is a deadly risk. “Recently, the woman died when she went to the well to collect water. The man was injured, ”says Gennady Yudin, a member of the White Angel crew.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T58-00-00-04-00/642805d49bcca427716354.jpg" />To travel to the right address, the police officer is forced to first clear the road from pieces of concrete and plastic - what was previously a house. Gennady's shells and fragments carefully go around. In an armored car - coal wheels, medical tools, children's bulletproof vests. Everything that may be needed for salvation.</p>
<p>This time, the police evacuated the elderly, who were asked to take away their natives who left earlier. One of the inhabitants first planted the cat on the cat by the Taadvorov Dog Aleska, for which he looked after and took with him to a safe place. It was very scary, ” - says another passenger.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-02T58-00-00-04-00/642805d49ac38245462836.jpg" />Both "white angels" - locals and understand the residents, because their families also experience the same. "My grandmother lived here on the fifth floor," shows Dmitry Solovaya, the Believed House "White Angel".</p>
<p>Police traveled locations where people can be extinguished. In addition, the route checked the property in broken stores where masters can operate. After the missile strike, the angels were found on the ground a shabby, Alevtsy Flag and returned it to the place of fluttering as a symbol of unbroken Avdiivka.While this material was being prepared, a tragedy occurred in Avdiivka-a 5-month-old baby and his grandmother were fired. Parents are hospitalized with injuries. The back before the arrival, the police persuaded their mother to leave and save the baby. Tsebula is not the first attempt to convince the woman, but in vain. The enemy is chaotic of life -long houses, so the only way to survive is to evacuate until it is too late.</p>

<p>“The enemy TG channels spread a fake, the basis of which became several photos of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces with a tag" not for sale "in one of the Turkish classical clothing stores.</p>
<p>These pictures allegedly confirm the implementation of the form. The main argumentist media is that the Ukrainian unicorn is not intended for commercial implementation, which is regulated by the regulatory acts of the Armed Forces. However, as reported by official representatives of the Turkish shop "Carlo Potti", they do not implement the Ukrainian military uniform. The exhibited sample is only a variant of possible sewing.</p>
<p>The form, along with the tag, left an unknown in the store. Ignorance of the language by sellers has contributed to its exhibition in the hall and there is no doubt that the inscription "with a hostile".</p>
<p>We warn!</p>
<p>Do not trust the materials that appeal to emotions, because excessive emotionality precipitates critical thinking and helps the perception of hostile fakes. "</p>

<ul>
<li>We very much hope that in the near future, Ukraine will be able to overlide its territories. However, I do not see that this war will end very fast. Because Russia is still a huge country. They also have enough weapons and equipment, so perhaps not the most modern, but there are also quite many. Therefore, it is a difficult process <strong> The liberation of its territories. But this is </strong><strong> the only way to stop Russia and end the war. And the mise of our part must do everything on us, everything is possible to help Ukraine more and better in this </strong>. Estonia is constantly coming to convey this position to larger allies who take up significant ones, because Estonia is a small country enough to do so with their little neighbors on their own.</li>

<ul>
<li>Our role is to explain that a compromise with the current leadership of Russia is unfortunate. Because compromise Russians consider an indicator of the weakness of another country and the opportunity to go on. That is why we have to support Ukraine as much as it takes, and as long as it will be needed, ”said Indrek Kannik.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also noted that it is not necessary to be too much afraid of Russia, because in many times it only blackmails other countries.</p>
<p>-I see that in many capitals of Europe, and in the United States of America, there are significant fears, in particular, in the nuclear issue. They see the great risk of this and, of course, this is an important question. On the other hand, we also mibbon that Russia uses it as a blackmail, as a intimidation of other countries. It is very important to keep the balance in this matter. After all, if we listen to what Russia says, then we can not, after all, do nothing. Because they will first say: "If you do not give Kiev, then we are a nuclear weapon," and then they will say the same thing about Warsaw, then by Berlin, Paris or any other capital of Europe. Therefore, they cannot be taken seriously in this matter, - said Indrek Kannik.</p>
<p>He said that Estonia is trying to explain to the countries of Europe and the United States regarding the policies of the Russians and in view of this, the importance of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance.</p>

One of the important is the thesis that Ukraine needs to help as much as it needs it.We would not be advised to think that relations with Russia will be normalized after the war after the war. After all, even if Russia is a short period of time, the tactical period is meant, it will be only when it was renewed after the war. Because in Russian society, we see the strong tendencies of imperialist thinking and, sooner or later, it will suppress this situation that is now. After all, the vast majority of people support Putin's political. This is not just about the mode. ** 70-80 percent Russian support or quietly support such aggressive policies</p>
<p><strong> In the </strong> economic sense, this society has remained behind other countries for a long time <strong>. The latest successful achievements they had were the flight of Yuriagarin - a Ukrainian, by the way. And after that there is nothing. It remains that you can terrorize the weapons and blackmails of smaller and possibly weaker neighbor in this sense. It has become just national pride, honor, because, as for me, nothing left for me. </strong></p>
<p>How to change it? Unfortunately, I don't have answers. Russia has to cut it itself. We cannot do this, we can only protect ourselves from them, "said Indrek Kannik.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, this is reported <a href="https://mkip.gov.ua/news/8912.html"></a>.</p>
<p>It is noted that on April 3, the Kolomyia City District Court of Ivano-Frankivsk Region reinstated the former Director General of the National Museum of the Holodomor-Genocide Olesya Stasyuk.</p>
<p>“Given the case file and the evidence presented, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy will get acquainted with the court's argumentation of Taneodinnosti will file an appeal. We emphasize that the release of Stasyuk OO From the post of the General Director of the Museum of the Holodomor -Genocide, the legitimate substitutions provided for by the contract and the current legislation were held, ”UMKIP emphasize.</p>
<p>The ministry reminds that Stasyuk was informed by a letter that for the last months there has been a significantly exacerbated speech around the number of victims <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-golodomor"></a>1932 - 1933, "connected by the innovation and aggressive promotion in the public space, there are currently insufficiently substantiated number of victims of 10.5 million Ukrainians."</p>

The MKIP position is unambiguous: an incorrect discussion in this regard in the public plane is unacceptable.</p>
<p>In view of this, the MKIP asked Stasiuk to explain the situation.</p>
<p>“At the same time, as of today Stasyuk never answered the question of the question, although he was obliged to do so in accordance with the contract. In accordance with the same contract, the contract of information concluded between the MKIP and Stasyuk information at the request of the Ministry is improper execution of the contractual condition, which became the basis for its dismissal, ”the ministry summarized.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult emotional trips.</p>
<p>They visited the berry - the usual small village of our Chernihiv region, which was transformed by Russian -circle into one of the world's largest examples of people.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers were made at school in a berry commanding point, and all residents of the village used to the basement of the school. Just like a living shield.</p>
<p>From the third to March 30 last year, more than three hundred people were held in the basement of this school.</p>
<p>Older people and quite young children, women and men ... The oldest woman was 93 years old, the youngest child is less than half a year.</p>
<p>Here is this basement, this concentration camp in berry, like all other crimes against people and humanity, will never forgive the state. And not just us.</p>
<p>The Kremlin will not be covered with a chair in the UN Council, gas pipes or anything else. A legitimate and fair responsibility for every Scientific Land, a Russian crime will certainly be. In the tribunal, in the International Criminal Court, in the Ukrainian courts.</p>

<p>He awarded our warriors who were marked in the defense of the state.</p>
<p>And very important - thanked everyone who provides the rebuilding of our Chernihiv region. All that the enemy destroyed, we will restore.</p>
<p>Ukraine will never be a country of ruins, no matter how they dreamed of it in the Kremlin. Their ones do not come true.</p>
<p>Already here, in Kiev, after returning he met with a delegation of American congration.</p>
<p>He thanked for the unchanged powerful assistance of America - all, from President Bidenai White House teams to both houses of Congress and the entire American force system.</p>

<p>Thank you all who help us protect freedom!I thank today, especially Denya Norway, for the initiative of governments to transfer to our soldiers additional parties of the artillery shells. It is very on time and useful.</p>

<p>Nezenza said this at a pressing at the UN Headquarters on the occasion of the Presidency of the CRF in the Radbeza, answering the question of Ukrinform.</p>
<p>The question was formulated as follows: “You know well that Russia is a UN Security Council, as in the UN in general, illegally. Is your country not wanted to start the process of legalization of its membership in the UN, as all other other countries have done after the former Yugoslavia, the Czechoslovakia Taradian Union ceased to exist? ”</p>
<p>"Russia is legally legally," Nemenza said, citing the fact that it is a continuer of the USSR. However, he did not explain how the disappearance of this state from the political map of the world is different from the cessation of two other socialist countries.</p>
<p>Neenza informed that during the presidency, Russia would initiate April 5 in the format of Arria with the participation of members of the Radbeza to discuss deportations from the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p>

<p>“I was curious to think about this topic. And I can say with full responsibility that I see in this role Vitaliy Stepanovsky. It is a coach who worked with many players, with many of them worked at the club. He is a patriot of Ukraine, a trainer who knows basketball well and already has extensive experience. If a coach can work abroad and give a steady result, it shows that Winfahivtsi knows his business, it is difficult to surprise such a trainer. The national team is a club where you can prepare the team for the season for more than a month. And Stepanovsky conveys how to prepare a team in express mode. Vitaliy is able to do it, he has already shown it. So for me - this is the candidate number one for the position of chief trainery of Ukraine, ”the rich said.</p>

<p>As Ukrinform reports, it reports <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/04/a152cd28ed5b-chinas-xi-did-not-support-japans-claim-over-russian-held-isles.html"></a>.</p>
<p>The news agency, with reference to the words of its own source, notes that the head of Japan did not support Japan's claim on the captured by the occupied Russia near Hokkaido during negotiations with the President of the Russian Federation Vladimirputin last month, abandoning the ancient position of their recognition.</p>
<p>During the meetings in Moscow, Putin said that China "did not support any scene" in this territorial dispute, moving to the policy of the neutrality of China's position, formed by the then Chinese leader of Mao Zedong in 1964, considering four disputed islands as the territory of Japan.</p>

<p>Change of position <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-kitaj"></a>It can complicate the dispute that lasts for decades, since Moscow is unlikely to have been in this matter now, with Beijing's support, viewers believe.</p>
<p>In July 1964, Mao Zedong told a delegation of the Socialist Party of Japan, who arrived on a visit to China, which was captured by Russia, "Need to return", that is, announced the support of Tokyo territorial claims by Beijing.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has taken this position, although in recent years it has been publicly not aware of it. On the maps made in China, the controversial islands are marked as "occupied by Russia."</p>

<p>Nezenza said this at a pressing at the UN Headquarters on the occasion of the Presidency of the CRF in the Radbeza, answering the question of Ukrinform.</p>
<p>The question was formulated as follows: “You know well that Russia is a UN Security Council, as in the UN in general, illegally. Is your country not wanted to start the process of legalization of its membership in the UN, as all other other countries have done after the former Yugoslavia, the Czechoslovakia Taradian Union ceased to exist? ”</p>
<p>"Russia is legally legally," Nemenza said, citing the fact that it is a continuer of the USSR. However, he did not explain how the disappearance of this state from the political map of the world is different from the cessation of two other socialist countries.</p>
<p>Neenza informed that during the presidency, Russia would initiate April 5 in the format of Arria with the participation of members of the Radbeza to discuss deportations from the occupied territories of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukrinform correspondent asked him another question after a briefing: "If President Putin summoned you, said that he had collapsed in Ukraine, lost 200,000 soldiers and asked for advice - what would you advise him as a diploma and just a Russian?"</p>
<p>“It is impossible to imagine - that he would ask me, he will not ask me. He has a head on his shoulders, ”the post of Russia replied at the UN.</p>

<p>In the Chernihiv region, there were many different events and negotiations to this morning.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult emotional trips.</p>
<p>They visited the berry - the usual small village of our Chernihiv region, which was transformed by Russian -circle into one of the world's largest examples of people.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers were made at school in a berry commanding point, and all residents of the village used to the basement of the school. Just like a living shield.</p>
<p>From the third to March 30 last year, more than three hundred people were held in the basement of this school.</p>
<p>Older people and quite young children, women and men ... The oldest woman was 93 years old, the youngest child is less than half a year.</p>
<p>Here is this basement, this concentration camp in berry, like all other crimes against people and humanity, will never forgive the state. And not just us.</p>
<p>The Kremlin will not be covered with a chair in the UN Council, gas pipes or anything else. A legitimate and fair responsibility for every Scientific Land, a Russian crime will certainly be. In the tribunal, in the International Criminal Court, in the Ukrainian courts.</p>
<p>I thank the guests of Ukraine who visited me Chernihiv, who saw this concentration of Russian evil in our berry. I thank Vicecanzler Germany Gabec and Council of Europe Secretary General Maria Peychinovich-Burich. Thank you and devices - meaningful, correct.As always, it was a special honor to visit our warriors at the hospital, which is after fighting. To thank everything they do for Ukraine, to thank them for their faith in Ukraine, which our people protect, are more valuable - their lives.</p>
<p>He handed Chernihiv distinction of the hero city, the city of Heroes. Chernihiv saw different evil, different evil ... to protect himself from this Russian evil - or more unharmed in our history.</p>
<p>He awarded our warriors who were marked in the defense of the state.</p>
<p>And very important - thanked everyone who provides the rebuilding of our Chernihiv region. All that the enemy destroyed, we will restore.</p>
<p>Ukraine will never be a country of ruins, no matter how they dreamed of it in the Kremlin. Their ones do not come true.</p>
<p>Already here, in Kiev, after returning he met with a delegation of American congration.</p>
<p>He thanked for the unchanged powerful assistance of America - all, from President Bidenai White House teams to both houses of Congress and the entire American force system.</p>
<p>Of course, they talked about Ukraine's active actions. Of course, about our joint winner.</p>
<p>He also met with Mike Pompeo, US State Department.</p>
<p>Thank you all who help us protect freedom!I thank today, especially Denya Norway, for the initiative of governments to transfer to our soldiers additional parties of the artillery shells. It is very on time and useful.</p>
<p>We become stronger daily. We approach the day when the terrorist state will answer.</p>
<p><strong> Glory to all who are in battle for Ukraine now!Eternal and light memory to all who have given their lives for Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>“At the same time, as of today Stasyuk never answered the question of the question, although he was obliged to do so in accordance with the contract. In accordance with the same contract, the contract of information concluded between the MKIP and Stasyuk information at the request of the Ministry is improper execution of the contractual condition, which became the basis for its dismissal, ”the ministry summarized.</p>

<p>About this during the presentation of the analytical report "Inter -Sectoral Cooperation: a lesson of the way to a sustainable society", which took place recently in Kiev, a director of the International Center for Defense and Security(ICDS)in Tallinn, Ministry of Estonia Ministry(1994)Indrek Kannik.</p>
<p>During the joint work of Estonia and Ukraine under the Stable Ukraine program, the International Defense and Security Center was investigated how Ukrainian -stateanation showed its sustainability under the conditions of a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, as important for our country, as well as for the whole of Europe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Among the Estonians, Ukraine's support probably exceeds 95 percent or even98. The question is about the Russian -speaking population of Estonia. There are approximately 40-50 percents definitely against this war and for Ukraine. 35-40% are those that are difficult to determine. They probably understand that Russia still does the wrong thing of Ukraine, but do not want to interfere and openly speak against aggression, because they have roots there. Those who do not support Ukraine and, unfortunately, are the open Putinists - about 15-20% of the Russian -speaking population. The reasons are different - from the propaganda of the Russian Federation to the Menalgia under the Soviet Union. I want to say that in Estonia a fairly large gap between generations. And if there are those who support the policies of the Russian Federation and Putin among the older Russian -speaking.</li>

<p>Summary of this busy day.</p>
<p>Rate. A new field meeting is the first in the Dnieper, now - in the first.</p>
<p>Key security issues on the front line, in the northern regions and the border.</p>
<p>Commanders of directions reported. This time, the generals of Syrsky and Tarnavsky reported on a protected connection, not personally, from the hottest pursuit.</p>
<p>The situation in Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Marinka and all over Donetsk. Bigorivka was given to Lugansk.</p>
<p>Head and Head of GUR MO, Head of the State Border Service, Defense Ministry.</p>
<p>A full meeting. Full coordination. Full preparation of our active actions for the sake of liberation of Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>In the Chernihiv region, there were many different events and negotiations to this morning.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult emotional trips.</p>
<p>They visited the berry - the usual small village of our Chernihiv region, which was transformed by Russian -circle into one of the world's largest examples of people.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers were made at school in a berry commanding point, and all residents of the village used to the basement of the school. Just like a living shield.</p>
<p>From the third to March 30 last year, more than three hundred people were held in the basement of this school… a regular rural school, and a basement - less than a meter.</p>
<p>Older people and quite young children, women and men ... The oldest woman was 93, the youngest child is less than six months.</p>
<p>Here is this basement, this concentration camp in berry, like all other crimes against people and humanity, will never forgive the state. And not just us.</p>
<p>The Kremlin will not be covered with a chair in the UN Council, gas pipes or anything else. A legitimate and fair responsibility for every Scientific Land, a Russian crime will certainly be. In the tribunal, in the International Criminal Court, in the Ukrainian courts.</p>
<p>I thank the guests of Ukraine who visited me Chernihiv, who saw this concentration of Russian evil in our berry. I thank the Vice Chancellor of Germany Gabec and Council of Europe Secretary General Maria Peychinovich-Burich. Thank you and devices - meaningful, correct.</p>
<p>I thank the UNESCO CEO Azuli Azul for her attention to Ukraine, for today's way in Ukraine. We prepare for the historical center of Chernihiv the status of UNESCO World Warness. The same status that has recently been obtained for the historical center of our Odessa.He handed Chernihiv distinction of the hero city, the city of Heroes. Chernihiv saw different evil, different evil ... to protect himself from this Russian evil - or more unnecessary in our history.</p>
<p>He awarded our warriors who were marked in the defense of the state.</p>
<p>And very important - thanked everyone who provides the rebuilding of our Chernihiv region. All that the enemy destroyed, we will restore.</p>
<p>Ukraine will never be a country of ruins, no matter how they dreamed of it in the Kremlin. Their ones do not come true.</p>
<p>Already here, in Kiev, after returning he met with a delegation of American congration.</p>
<p>He thanked for the unchanged powerful assistance of America - all, from President Bidenai White House teams to both houses of Congress and the entire American force system.</p>
<p>Of course, they talked about Ukraine's active actions. Of course, about our joint winner.</p>
<p>He also met with Mike Pompeo, ex-head of the US Department of State.</p>
<p>Thank you all who help us protect freedom!I thank today, especially Denya Norway, for the initiative of governments to transfer to our soldiers additional parties of the artillery shells. It is very on time and useful.</p>
<p>We become stronger daily. We approach the day when the terrorist state will answer.</p>
