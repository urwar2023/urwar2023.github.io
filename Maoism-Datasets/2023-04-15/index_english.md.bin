“The works of Ivan Franko will be presented for the first time in the choir genre. In the play by the works of Ivan Franko's works "Lis Nikita" and "Painted Fox", the animals who live a peaceful socio-political life, occupy positions, are in family relations, have their own state structure, sue, quarrel, rejoice and cry.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He spoke with French President Macron today. There was a long conversation, almost half hours. They managed to walk on all key security issues, which is the day of the day - ours, in Ukraine, is very important, and in general in Europe.

It is a front, our ability to move, to act, to return freedom and justice in those territories that, unfortunately, are occupied by Russia.

International contacts were discussed - both ours and France. Emmanuel informed about the details and results of the visit to China. And I thank you for the clear support of those print things that combine our whole anti -war coalition.

Russia should be taken from the territory of Ukraine. All Ukraine and all occupiers. The iconic point of the UN Charter must work again - none of the Russian orders of international law can be ignored. It is on these principles that safety and tranquility will come to international relations. For this purpose, the E -Ukrainian formula of peace, absolutely realistic and quite specific, was also discussed in detail with the macron, as well as the international events that we blink this year, including the NATO Vilnius Summit.

Our common position at the Lithuanian Summit-all the participating states-can be the ambitious samette, which European security needs. I am sure of this. Safety of security for Ukraine, that is, in fact, for an international order based on the rules, it is necessary before our entry into the Alliance.

By the way, in Vilnius a meeting of the Member States of the Joint Investigative Group of Investigation of the Crimes of the invaders in Ukraine took place. One of the results of the meeting of Jugoda - it was signed yesterday. The Agreement on Joint Investigation of not only Russian military crimes, but also a crime of genocide.

We will provide at all levels, including legal, full responsibility for the Russian and Ukrainians. And I thank all the partners who assault the sentences for the occupiers - for Russian murderers and terrorists.Only one of this strike of terrorists has damaged and destroyed more than 50 residential buildings, of which more than 30 are multi -apartment ones. The wounded -more than 20 people, as of this time -the dead already 11. Among them is a very young child -the 21st year of the 21st year of birth. My condolences to my relatives, to all who have lost their close ...

None of those who are guilty of this aggression can forgive and forget anything.

Today, two other sanctions against persons and companies have been published or helping the blame for this terror. In particular, these are the sanctions of persons who promote the terrorist state are covered by sports. Again, who is associated with its officials. A separate list is IT companies, quality terror, or give digital opportunities to continue aggression.

All Ukrainian sanctions synchronize with global sanctions, this is an inevitable process. I thank all in international institutions and partner states, who work with us, with government officials, with NSDCs, specialists, with our office.

The sanction pressure on anyone who is guilty of this aggression, blocking their assets at the level of the world is the self-defense of the world and now from any other opportunities for aggression.

The return of peace and its stability have no alternatives.

Thank you all who help us, Ukraine!Glory to all our soldiers who are in the battle of terrorists!

Let us return justice as a decent memory of all whose life was taken by Russia Terror ...

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

This is reported by Ukrinform with reference to the EWL migration platform.

Two -thirds of workers were women(66%), mainly at the age of 35-44. The field of workers from Ukraine was employed for simple physical work. Among them, 37% found work in the field of services, 34%-at industrial enterprises. Much fewer citizens of Ukraine were employed in a transport industry and logistics(15%)and trade or construction(7%).

Серед працівників сфери послуг переважали зайняті у готельному бізнесі,гастрономії, адміністративних послугах і допоміжної діяльності, наприклад, уклінінгових компаніях, агентствах тимчасової праці.

And mostly did not possess Polish. Therefore, they were most often taken for simple physical work, as often such acans do not require knowledge of Polish and experience. According to our research, the work in the field of services was most often selected by those refugees who worked in this field and in Ukraine, but also highly qualified specialists, ” - said Director of the Department of International Recruitment of Migration Platform, Martin Kolodzeychyk.

The study of the monthly conjuncture index in Poland has shown that the proportion of companies that stated plans for increased labor increased under the end.

“Today the government has adopted a resolution prohibiting the import into Poland [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zerno), as well as dozens of other types of products, I am unable to list them all. They are envisaged in the annex of the extent - from declared grain to honey products, very multi -produce, ”Kaczynski said.

The politician emphasized that, given the asymmetry between the Polish and Ukrainian agriculture, if the Ukrainian agricultural products were over the Polish market without restrictions, it would lead to the "very far -reaching Crisis of Polish Agriculture." Therefore, the RP government cannot allow it to happen.

"We have informed our Ukrainian friends about the decisions and are ready to be any will, perhaps in the coming days, to start negotiations to regulate the customization in the form of an interstate agreement," Kaczynski stressed.

He assured that Poland wants to have as close relations with Ukraine as possible, "Alepol agriculture must be protected."

In his turn, the Minister of Agriculture Robert Telus said that the Zabron importation of all agricultural products from Ukraine is “a very decisive -departmental, but it is a declaration for negotiation with Ukraine.”“The cost of this assistance(Ukraine - ed.)The whole of Europe should be carried, not only by Polish farmers, ”Telus stated.

They emphasized that the significant part of the Ukrainian grain is not transported in transit further, but settles the Polls, thereby reducing the purchase prices in the RP for the grain of Polish agrarians.

However, the European Commission did not fulfill the demand of the Polish farmers for the introduction of duties on Ukrainian companions and continued for another year, until June 5, 2024, an agreement on duty -free importation of goods from Ukraine.

According to Ukrinform, Reznikov reported in [](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=664662155670139&set=a.325425039593854).

“Під час насиченого візиту до Бухареста взяв участь у роботі Чорноморськоїбезпекової конференції Міжнародної Кримської платформи. Цей майданчик ставважливим елементом консолідації зусиль на підтримку України. Скориставсянагодою особисто подякувати румунським партнерам, які з перших днівповномасштабного вторгнення надають Україні всебічну підтримку як добрі сусідиі справжні друзі”, – написав він.

Резніков у своєму виступі на конференції зробив акцент на п’яти рамковихтезах, які, на його погляд, мають бути в основі комплексу рішень щодозабезпечення миру, безпеки, добробуту та розвитку у Чорноморському регіоні.

За його словами, вільний світ має змінити парадигму своїх дій у контекстівідсічі агресіям. Повільні дії постфактум не працюють. “Не провокувати” – непрацює, зазначив міністр.

Він наголосив, що росіянам не потрібні провокації, щоб розв’язати війну, цевже неодноразово доведено.

This is an important change in consciousness, not all psychologically ready. Without this readiness, political will will not appear. But it is this approach that will be the best sober factor for any aggressor, ”Reznikov said.

In his opinion, a system of guarantees-warriors, which will bring the dominum desire to solve something by force.

“In the context of the Black Sea region, everything is obvious - there is no alternative [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato). There is no alternative to Ukraine in NATO. We have proved their ability to strengthen the Alliance and have taken formal steps - giving an entry. The absence of movement will only continue uncertainty and risks, ”the head of the Ministry of Defense emphasized.He emphasized that the question of the transformation of Russia should arise on the agenda, and the thesis of some partners that Moscow should be involved in all important officials of the region is broken by reality. "After all, with the current terrorist regime, which feeds on imperial phantom pain, some arrangements are impossible in Principles," the Minister of Defense is convinced.

"There must be a joint resistance, including - fixed through a system of powerful sanctions that, non -transformation into a true democratic federation, Russia will not be able to restore the pensions with the civilized world," Reznikov said.

“And finally. Time. The right medicines used late, with late, may not work. Delaying or "freezing" of war is contrary to the interests of the region. The region will lose dynamics as others develop. Therefore, the joint interest is to achieve a break in the battlefield in 2023. For this purpose, Ukraine is sufficiently sufficient for Ukraine, ”Reznikov said.

He added that there are a number of very specific steps to develop these positions that Ukraine now discusses with partners and prepares for implementation or already embodied.

According to Reznikov, the Black and Azov seas will be a spacious peace, and Crimean will turn home.

This emphasized in his evening [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR9R_IpRKto)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.

_Viso: [](https://t.me/OP_UA/9240)_

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

He spoke with French President Macron today. There was a long conversation, almost half hours. They managed to walk on all key security issues, which is the day of the day - ours, in Ukraine, is very important, and in general in Europe.

It is a front, our ability to move, to act, to return freedom and justice in those territories that, unfortunately, are occupied by Russia.

International contacts were discussed - both ours and France. Emmanuel informed about the details and results of the visit to China. And I thank you for the clear support of those print things that combine our whole anti -war coalition.

Russia should be taken from the territory of Ukraine. All Ukraine and all occupiers. The iconic point of the UN Charter must work again - none of the Russian orders of international law can be ignored. It is on these principles that safety and tranquility will come to international relations. For this purpose, the E -Ukrainian formula of peace, absolutely realistic and quite specific, was also discussed in detail with the macron, as well as the international events that we blink this year, including the NATO Vilnius Summit.

Our common position at the Lithuanian Summit-all the participating states-can be the ambitious samette, which European security needs. I am sure of this. Safety of security for Ukraine, that is, in fact, for an international order based on the rules, it is necessary before our entry into the Alliance.

By the way, in Vilnius a meeting of the Member States of the Joint Investigative Group of Investigation of the Crimes of the invaders in Ukraine took place. One of the results of the meeting of Jugoda - it was signed yesterday. The Agreement on Joint Investigation of not only Russian military crimes, but also a crime of genocide.

We will provide at all levels, including legal, full responsibility for the Russian and Ukrainians. And I thank all the partners who assault the sentences for the occupiers - for Russian murderers and terrorists.Only one of this strike of terrorists has damaged and destroyed more than 50 residential buildings, of which more than 30 are multi -apartment ones. The wounded -more than 20 people, as of this time -the dead already 11. Among them is a very young child -the 21st year of the 21st year of birth. My condolences to my relatives, to all who have lost their close ...

None of those who are guilty of this aggression can forgive and forget anything.

Today, two other sanctions against persons and companies have been published or helping the blame for this terror. In particular, these are the sanctions of persons who promote the terrorist state are covered by sports. Again, who is associated with its officials. A separate list is IT companies, quality terror, or give digital opportunities to continue aggression.

All Ukrainian sanctions synchronize with global sanctions, this is an inevitable process. I thank all in international institutions and partner states, who work with us, with government officials, with NSDCs, specialists, with our office.

The sanction pressure on anyone who is guilty of this aggression, blocking their assets at the level of the world is the self-defense of the world and now from any other opportunities for aggression.

The return of peace and its stability have no alternatives.

Thank you all who help us, Ukraine!Glory to all our soldiers who are in the battle of terrorists!

Let us return justice as a decent memory of all whose life was taken by Russia Terror ...

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-15T22-13-56-03-00/630_360_1681585662-299.jpg)The Kyiv Academic Theater of the Young Viewer has prepared the premiere of the performance-choro according to the works of Frank.

Ukrinform was reported in the theater.

“The works of Ivan Franko will be presented for the first time in the choir genre. In the play by the works of Ivan Franko's works "Lis Nikita" and "Painted Fox", the animals who live a peaceful socio-political life, occupy positions, are in family relations, have their own state structure, sue, quarrel, rejoice and cry. In their everyday life, animals are very similar to humans. The life is an eternal struggle for survival, and in this struggle everyone does, ” - said in the theater a new performance.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-04-15T22-13-56-03-00/1681585826-399.jpg)"Most of their lives are hiding behind the masks of those whom they would like to seem. Finally, it distorts their consciousness and deforms the morality that the huts are torn down," there is only a quiet horror. So, the choir genre is approaching this idea. There are also elements of grotesque, tragicomedy and drama, ”said the director of Katerypura in a comment to Ukrinform.

“Lis Nikita is the best image that I could convey my beliefs to such a complex audience. He is bold, ambitious, he is lying, fools, laughs ... And this is a world in which modern teenagers live. For me, it is important to expose human vices and benefits to make the answer be obvious. Ivan [ ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-franko)So skillfully wrote out every character of this story, so boldly entangles the fox from every trap that the viewer involuntarily admires the fox, although the positiveness of this character is quite doubtful. However, this is the great conception of which I became fascinated: the world is not black and white, it is mostly black with white -white and to survive a little to the mud, ” - said the surveyor.

The horizon "Lis Nikita" is designed exclusively for young viewers 14+ and their father.

The poster was created by the artificial intelligence of the art director Lesya Kovpak.

At the moment, the chief task is to prevent Russian aviation into the airspace of our state, which we control. Controlled bombs are a new challenge and a new threat that you need to respond and accelerate the decision of our partner to grant such powerful systems as Patriot and SAMP/T of the Four Plus F-16-16-Plus generation, which will be able to counteract Russian aviation.

Then there was a certain period, the occupation weapons were used by military positions. Today, Russians are increasingly used in civilians. Probably this is the result of the defeat they suffered on the front. In this way, they take revenge.

Alexei Dmitryashkivsky noted that in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya directions the number of aviation strikes ranges from five to ten a day.

The speaker also urged the civilian population not to ignore the airline signals, since it is the aircraft blows that carry much more destruction of victims.

He spoke with French President Macron today. There was a long conversation, almost half hours. They managed to walk on all key security issues, which is the day of the day - ours, in Ukraine, very important, and in general in Europe.

It is a front, our ability to move, to act, to return freedom and justice in those territories that, unfortunately, are occupied by Russia.

International contacts were discussed - both ours and France. Emmanuel informed about the details and results of the visit to China. And I thank you for the clear support of those print things that combine our whole anti -war coalition.

Russia should be taken from the territory of Ukraine. All Ukraine and all occupiers. The iconic point of the UN Charter must work again - none of the Russian orders of international law can be ignored. It is on these principles that safety and tranquility will come to international relations. For this purpose, the E -Ukrainian formula of peace, absolutely realistic and quite specific, was also discussed in detail with the macron, as well as the international events that we blink this year, including the NATO Vilnius Summit.

Our common position at the Lithuanian Summit-all the participating states-can be the ambitious samette, which is needed by European security. I am sure of this. Safety of security for Ukraine, that is, in fact, for an international order based on the rules, it is necessary before our entry into the Alliance.

By the way, in Vilnius a meeting of the Member States of the Joint Investigative Group of Investigation of the Crimes of the invaders in Ukraine took place. One of the results of the meeting of Jugoda - it was signed yesterday. The Agreement on Joint Investigation of not only Russian military crimes, but also a crime of genocide.

We will provide at all levels, including legal, full responsibility for the Russian and Ukrainians. And I thank all the partners who helps to approach the sentences for the occupiers - for Russian murderers and terrorists.

In Slovian in Donbass, a search operation is still underway after a Russian -roller strike that happened yesterday. There is information that under the rubble of the houses - the cheat of the dead, unfortunately ...

Only one of this strike of terrorists has damaged and destroyed more than 50 residential buildings, of which more than 30 are multi -apartment ones. The wounded-more than 20 people, as of this time-the dead already 11. Among them is a very young child-the 21st age of the 21st year of birth. My condolences to my relatives, to all who have lost their close ...Today, two other sanctions against persons and companies have been published or helping the blame for this terror. In particular, these are the sanctions of persons who promote the terrorist state are covered by sports. Again, who is associated with its officials. A separate list is IT companies, qualifying terror or giving digital opportunities to continue aggression.

All Ukrainian sanctions synchronize with global sanctions, this is an inevitable process. I thank all in international institutions and partner states, who work with us, with government officials, with NSDCs, specialists, with our office.

The sanction pressure on anyone who is guilty of this aggression, blocking their assets at the level of the world is the self-defense of the world and now from any other opportunities for aggression.

The return of peace and its stability have no alternatives.

Thank you all who help us, Ukraine!Glory to all our soldiers who are in the battle of terrorists!

Let us return justice as a decent memory of all whose life was taken by Russia Terror ...

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

In 2019, the European Green Course adopted the European. Ambitious goal - by 2050 Europe will become the first climatic neutral continent. Ukraine said about 2060. In [interview](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/15/shkoda-dovkillyu-vid-vijny-vzhe-perevyshhuye-19-tryljona-gryven-ruslan-strilecz/)Correspondent Armyinform Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Ruslan Striple told how the process of Green Recovery of Ukraine is ongoing:

“For Ukraine, green recovery is not a reconstruction by old projects. For example, when reconstruction of destroyed homes, even the location of the house will be important. After all, where the windows are directed will depend on the cost of heating in winter and for cooling in the summer. It is also important to use energy -saving materials.

Green recovery is also the restoration of industry on European standards. There is an understanding that our industry will be re -done in a mental, taking into account modern "green" technologies.

Therefore, even despite the war, the Mindovil did not stop working on the introduction of a reform of reduction and control of industrial pollution, but the actual co -modernization of industry. We have attached international experts, Czech Republic, Latvia to work. They worked together with the deputies of the profile committee of Ukraine, experts of the reform support team at Mindovquil, the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Germany and the GIZ project. As the result today we have a substantially revised draft law 6004-D.

The adoption of the bill will allow to implement the provisions of the Directive 2010/75/EC, to introduce the best available technologies and management methods, to launch industry eco -modernization and to fulfill one of the conditions for Ukraine's full membership in the European Union. When we introduce the position of this directive, built in the Soviet times and the units of the contamination of Russia will no longer be able to be restored according to old projects, but will not continue to poison the environment. Now it is a unique window to switch to modern environmental standards.

In general, since the beginning of a large -scale war, Ukraine has already adopted 9 Euro integration laws in the field of environmental. This is greater progress than a core of 5 years. In particular, we have launched reform of the waste management system, reform of the national chemical safety system, etc.Green recovery is accurately greening transport, eco-freelyarchitectural and engineering solutions. For example, even before a pandemic in Beijing, people were in masks because of smoke, because there skyscrapers there did not allow the exhaust gases from vehicles. And in European countries, external installations are installed to clean up urban air.

The world moves further, and we must catch up very quickly. This is the ideal signarter of the world and Ukraine that I would like to see. To live in such a country. "

Згодом ми розширили функціонал застосунку. Під’єднали до нього всі діючі постимоніторингу — радіаційного фону, якості повітря та води. Зараз там такожвідображається мапа повітряних тривог.

„ЕкоЗагроза“ є частиною створеної нами раніше „ЕкоСистеми“ — єдиноїзагальнонаціональної платформи, через яку ми надаємо адміністративні послугионлайн та відкриваємо довкіллєві дані.

Запуск „ЕкоЗагрози“ — це було термінове рішення. Іде війна і наша „ЕкоСистема“змушена була „одягнути камуфляж“. Коли війна закінчиться, „ЕкоЗагроза“ зновстане „ЕкоСистемою“. Однак і після цього через застосунок можна будеповідомляти про всі виявлені порушення довкіллєвого законодавства.

Although it is small, but very native our Ukrainian church, - says Ms. Lilia. - We are very glad that now is the Zavaysky. I look at them and I have tears in my eyes. I want to wish that they were all healthy so that their guardian angel protected everyone so that they would all come to their families. We pray for them every day. And we are very proud that we have such defenders.

The military says that their baskets have everything that Ukrainians have traditionally put a celebration table.

- Something brought from home, from vacations, something was given in stock, something transmitted. We painted the eggs ourselves. In our basket, Easter eggs, sausages, salt, butter, cheese, pad, - says a military named Ivanna. - After consecration, we will love all our boys. At least a piece of holy Easter cake they taste. They perform combat missions, keep defense. They wait for Easter, approach the victory. So we want the next resurrection of Christ to be marked in a victorious free Ukraine.

Paratroopers from each unit of the brigade came to the church.

- After the consecration, they will go to the brothers and the seats. There will be at the time when it is, in the intervals between the tasks, to celebrate, - says paratroopers.

- I have already consecrated a lot of belts for our defenders, - he says. - I wish all the defenders and defenders of God the blessing, the victory!May the Lord, who risen from the dead and did not let him be reminiscent of, the Hens are in our souls.
