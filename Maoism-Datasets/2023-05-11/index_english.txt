We remember that Russia has tried to destroy the entire Ukrainian people and steal our history, culture, religion, because they cannot be proud of their own. We will also remember how Russia tries to carry out the most genocide today, killing innocent men, women and children, to destroy the Ukrainian nation.

Ukraine courageously fights for the ideals of Europe that we celebrate today. In Russia, Putin and his regime destroyed these values. And now they are destroyed here in Ukraine. Because they are afraid of the success you put out and the example you show. And they are afraid of your path of the Doevrosouz. "
Ursula von Der Lyen noted that “in this struggle, the European Union and its Member States stand side by side with Ukraine… The first task is to help providing the necessary ammunition to Ukraine. You know that we work in three directions. The fastest way is the immediate release of ammunition from the member states. We have allocated 1 billion euros, and that works. Significant ammunition was delivered or headed to Ukraine. Thus, the second-hand, which we agreed last week, provides 1 billion euros of the European Peace Fund for purchase by member states of ammunition155 and 152 millimeters. To accelerate this work, the third track helps member states to increase production, increase production and accelerate ammunition for meeting the needs of Ukraine and Member States. "

Therefore, many leaders in the world are in a state of strategic "oscillation". I do not have them "yes, but ...". There is no "but". There is an invasion.

“I often hear from them - we want peace. Yes, I also want peace. And there are no people who would like peace more than Ukrainians who are bombing every day. I am a saw -in -law hospital in Spain, where many Ukrainian servicemen are treated after injuries and amputations. It is clear that the Ukrainians want a meir. But don't tell me - I want peace. Say how to achieve it, and what kind of peace should be achieved…. If the event stops supporting Ukraine, the war will end. But it will end with Ukraine, ”the EU high representative said.

This can happen, ”Josepborrel emphasized.

Read also: Borrel "This is an existential threat to him, to Vladimir Putin, but not for Russia. We have nothing against the Russian people, who also suffers from this mad idea, to invade Ukraine. It is excluding the responsibility of a person called Vladimir Putin. But not my business is to release how political processes will develop in Russia. My business is to support Ukraine, ”Josep Borrel added.
As it was reported, since the beginning of Russian military aggression in February 2022 the European Union and its Member States began to provide Ukraine with significant political, economic, financial, humanitarian and military assistance. EU officials and member states at all levels have repeatedly stated that it would be necessary to support Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression so much as it would be necessary.

Zedobre that President Xi called President Zelensky. When we will be consumed by our strategy(EU - ed.)As for China, we must be very disagreeable in order for China to act according to its own responsibility, the country is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, ”said Josep Borrel.

Defense heads of the Union countries who held a meeting with the NATO format committee today identified the strategic directions for the development of the Alliance and confirmed the adamant support of Ukraine in its struggle for Russian aggression.
As reports Ukrinform, Admiral Rob Bauer, said the NATO headquarters today at a press conference at the NATO Headquarters.
NATO Military Committee is the highest body of the Alliance's military administration, which determines the needs of defense and development of the Armed Forces to ensure the collective defense of the Allies, to enforce political decisions in the country's leaders.
"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Admiral Bauer said.
"The heads of the South Defense have confirmed their unchanged support-there is no doubt that NATO will support Ukraine for as long as it is a budget," the head of the NATO Military Committee added.
He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.
“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to join, adapt and protect, ”Rob Bauer said.
He recalled that the Armed Forces of the Union countries now unite 3.2 million people in military uniforms, and they all work for the same purpose-reliably protection of a billion citizens living in the Alliance, the tadomocratic values they share. Their commitment and determination are a clear signal to the potential aggressor - NATO will protect every inch.
"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.

From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian invaders have not created a systematic support system, have suffered heavy losses, and now forced to use outdated equipment and uninvited people in large numbers.
As reports Ukrinform, the day before in Brussels, during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of Defense of the Union countries, said the chairman of the Military Committee Natoadmiral Rob Bauer.
At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.
“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the award miscalculations that Russia was preparing for the three -day, "forgot" to inform the performers about its goals and could not expand the logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said the Dutch Admiral Bauer.
He noted that in the conditions of fighting on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into a logistics competition, and this is what happens in Ukraine now. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.
“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO's Military Committee said.“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be associated with collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Rob Bauer said.
He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.
In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in the Europian American General Christopher Cavola noted that the Russian army should not be underestimated.
“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”said the US military commander.

Since the beginning of May, especially in the days declared by the occupiers of the festive tavhihid, in the temporarily occupied territories in Zaporizhzhya and Kherson region the number of cases of looting and theft of Russian servicemen has increased significantly. The property and vehicles are mainly stolen by a release of the need to ensure evacuation of the population.
About it wrote Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar in Telegrams.
“In the settlements Tokmak, childbirth, Kamianka, Rozivka, Mikhailivka, Molochansk, Energodar, Chernihivka in the temporarily occupied territory of the Uzaporozhye region, Russian invaders, covering up with the so -called provision of mechanical measures, stolen the material values of local enterprises of Tagiv.
According to Anna Malyar, in Energodar at night from the territory of the private enterprise "Electropodenmontazh-10", about 20 units of transportation were stolen and the composition of material property was looted.
Also, at night, under the pretext of evacuation of the Russian occupation administration of the razing point Skadovsk in the temporarily occupied territory in the Kherson region, the invaders hastily removed the looted office equipment and other property.
"It is probably that on May 7 this year, Russian invaders will be used to move the stolen property of the temporarily occupied Crimea," Anna Malyar said.

 The Russian Federation should be clearly aware that it will never be able to defeat Ukraine.
About it stated UK's military adviser Jan Stabbs.
“Over the last week, Russia has again inflicted massive rocket launchers from UAVs from settlements throughout Ukraine with minimal observance or compliance. It should be noted that on Monday, the Ukrainian red cross reported that as a result of rocket mole 1000 square meters of humanitarian aid, which kept in the large warehouse of the Odessa region, were completely destroyed. Such attacks by Russian are directed to punish the Ukrainian people and sow terror. These are the marstoky acts of revenge and the shameful manifestation of the inability of Russian military protection, ”said Jan Stabbs, expressing during the OSCE meeting a strict transmission of Russia.
The UK's military adviser also emphasized the irony of false navigat of Russia on confrontation, taking into account its past actions.
"I would like to emphasize the irony that this was happening by the country that invaded Georgia in 2008, illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, and has begun a large -scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year," he said.
Jan Stabbs has confirmed the support of the United Kingdom of Ukraine.
“Russia must realize that it will never be able to win in Ukraine. If it continues to fight, it will continue to lose. We are not underestimating a prolonged threat from the Russian Federation, but over time Ukraine will have a reason to celebrate. Ukraine will continue to demonstrate its decisiveness and unwavering moral force, struggling for the liberation of most of the homeland. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine will be fully restored. The United Kingdom and the International Security Company will remain adamant in support - we will support Ukraine as much as it does not need it, ”Jan Stabbs summarized.

 "Energoatom" received information about the preparation of Russian invaders for "evacuation" from the satellite city of Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant(Rabbit)Almost 3100 people.
About it reports SE "NNEGC" Energoatom ".
First of all, it is about the export of 2,700 station employees who have signed a contract with the fake AO "Explaining Organization of the Zaporozhye ACE" or other Rosatom's enterprise and their families.
At the same time, Energoatom reminds that the employees of the NPP departure from the city of Rashistisaboronized almost from the beginning of the occupation. Also, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, part of the family atomic atomicians have already been taken out of Energodar to the Rostov region of the Russian Federation.
Thus, the Russian invaders prove their inability to provide the operation of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, as it is now lacking in skilled personnel. Even those Ukrainian workers who, having signed the shameful contracts, agreed to cooperate with the ages, are going to "evacuate" in the near future. And this will exacerbate the very urgent issue of the presence of sufficient staff to ensure the safety of operations of the NPP, even in the current disconnected condition.
At the same time, Energoatom, for its part, takes all possible measures to formulate the required number of specialists who can ensure safe operation of the stations in the first period after its de -occupation. Such a team will be formed by the WEZ employees who are currently in the territory controlled by Ukraine, as well as specialists from other nuclear power plants.
"As soon as possible, the de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, the expulsion of the racists from the energy and the transmission of control over the station of its legitimate Ukrainian operator, Energoatom, is the only way to stop the Russian disorder to tagua its further security," the statement reads.

This is stated in the message of the British defense department, placed on the Government Portal of Great Britain.

He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin managed to make more naked.
“Since Finland is now a full member of NATO, and Sweden is expected to complete the introduction in the coming months, Putin has only been able to make Nasalias stronger than ever. I look forward to working with other heads of defense agencies to complete the transformation(https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/11/09/nastupnyj-samit-nato-vidbudetsya-vlitku-2023-roku-v-lytvi/)”, - said Anthony Radakin.
