<p>До вшанування 90-х роковин Голодомору-геноциду 1932-33 років Світовий КонґресУкраїнців (SKU)It announces a unique project for students of grades 8-12, who will collect stories from the third and fourth generations of famine, and will also be able to share their memories of how they were able to escape from the genocide war of Russia.</p>
<p>The initiators of the project "We Remember" have been the world network of descendants of the void of the voice in cooperation with the World Coordination Educational and Educational Council(Codor)The World Congress of Ukrainians and Independent Ukrainian Television Chanada KONTAKT NEXT GEN.</p>
<p>As part of the project, students of grades 8-12 will record a series of interviews with the descendants of the 1932-33 one. A selection of records will be professionally edited, and this fall it can be aired by the KONTAKT NEXT GEN TV program as part of the UWC initiative to honor the 90th anniversary and will be published on the website of the Holodomor. Every lesson/student who/-a will submit a certificate for participation and and will be defined/-a on the site of the Holodomor descendants.</p>
<p>Olga Soroka, the head of the Holodomor descendants, considers this project as extracted: “As the descendants of those who have undergone unspeakable horrors at the hands of a totalitarian man during the famine-genocide, we remember. We remember the storylines of their experiences and pass them on to our children who will pass on their generations. We remember that Russia has tried to destroy the entire Ukrainian people and steal our history, culture, religion, because they cannot be proud of their own. We will also remember how Russia tries to carry out the most genocide today, killing innocent men, women and children, to destroy the Ukrainian nation. We are glad to welcome you to the other cycle "We Remember" where you will hear from the third and fourth -haired descendants of the Holodomor, some of which have avoided the present genocide made by Russia.

<p><strong>Misinformation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The hostile TG channels wrote: "The Guardian today is a big article in which the wounded and injured military of the Armed Forces complain that they feel post-traumatic syndrome and at the same time absolutely no one in Ukraine is needed in Ukraine."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"In honor of the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany, on Victory Day, the United States announced their decision to allocate another $ 1.2 billion to help the Nazis in Ukraine," the American publicist Jackson Hinkle wrote on his Twitter page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TG hostile channels reported that The Washington Post allegedly summarized: “Some fears that if Ukrainians do not cope, Kiev may lose international military assistance or face new pressure to start negotiations with Moscow at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield . Such negotiations will almost certainly include Russia's requirements for the negotiating surrender of the sovereign territory. "</li>

Ukraine courageously fights for the ideals of Europe that we celebrate today. In Russia, Putin and his regime destroyed these values. And now they are destroyed here in Ukraine.

<p>Ursula von Der Lyen noted that “in this struggle, the European Union and its Member States stand side by side with Ukraine… The first task is to help providing the necessary ammunition to Ukraine. You know that we work in three directions. The fastest way is the immediate release of ammunition from the member states. We have allocated 1 billion euros, and that works. Significant ammunition was delivered or headed to Ukraine. Thus, the second-hand, which we agreed last week, provides 1 billion euros of the European Peace Fund for purchase by member states of ammunition155 and 152 millimeters. To accelerate this work, the third track helps member states to increase production, increase production and accelerate ammunition for meeting the needs of Ukraine and Member States. "</p>

<p>Therefore, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces followed several ways to decompose this issue.</p>
<p>And we have results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, NATO standards have created groups of psychologists to work with combat stress. * Also, on the basis of the military institute of the window, mobilized civilian psychologists under an intensive program are being prepared. * We have already launched and tested the pilot project of decompression of fighters who are on the front country. Now we work on its scale. * And, of course, we prepare our students of future military psychologists.</li>

<p>His column under the heading "Vladimir Putin is the most dangerous fool of the Education" was published in the newspaper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/opinion/putin-ukraine-war.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of this war, there was only one place where it is possible to understand her course of dissent - in the head of Vladimir Putin. Unfortunately, Putin does not issue a cart to his mash, ”Columnist said.</p>

<p>In his opinion, the Russian head began the war "almost without the participation of his capital or military command, and, of course, without mass calls from the side of the Russian people."</p>
<p>Putin has never had a plan B, as he thought he would capture Kyiv and continue to threaten all of Europe, Friedman says.</p>
<p>“<strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin"></a></strong> He put himself in a situation, he cannot win, cannot lose and cannot stop, - the journalist said. - He can no longer capture control of all of Ukraine. Alevodes cannot afford to be defeated after spending only Russian lives and money. Therefore, he cannot stop. "</p>

<p>So Putin resorted to the shelling of Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure - the war for exhaustion, hoping that "he will be able to somehow deduce sufficient from Ukrainians and deplete Western allies of Kiev so much that they will give him a large enough piece of Russian -speaking Eastern Ukraine. Victory. "</p>
<p>Putin B plan is to mask what plan A has failed, the NYT Columnist concludes.</p>
<p>"If this military operation had an honest name, it would be called the surgery of" preserved face, "he said.</p>

<p>The author notes that because of the fear of his own people, Putin "grabs for any reason to justify the war he began through his personal fantasy that Ukraine is not a real country, but only part of Russia."</p>
<p>In particular, he is scared that after the war he will be remembered by the number of victims of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>This was announced today in Brussels during a discussion under the European Chief and Defense Summit and Defense Summit, the EU High Representative Josep Borrel, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“Putin can't win this war. This is our most powerful obligation - my personal, the entire European Union and the free world. Putin cannot win a war, and the world must understand what is happening in Ukraine. This is another, diplomatic battle, which is no less important than the battle on the battlefield. Therefore, many leaders in the world are in a state of strategic "oscillation". I do not have them "yes, but ...". There is no "but". There is an invasion. When however, theraine invaded another, for no reason, without any excuse. Hundreds of people will be attenuated, hundreds of people. There are no "but" around this, "Josepborrell said.</p>

This name has ceased to be geographical determination, from now on it is a political position. At the same time it is necessary to avoid the new parcel between the West and the rest of the world - such a division would be very convenient for the Russia. Most countries of the world - 141 states - voted in the UN of Antrosic aggression. They do not support this aggressive war now. But the Evstrains that, according to Borrel, are not determined enough in its condemnation.</p>
<p>“I often hear from them - we want peace. Yes, I also want peace. And there are no people who would like peace more than Ukrainians who are bombing every day. I am a saw -in -law hospital in Spain, where many Ukrainian servicemen are treated after injuries and amputations. It is clear that the Ukrainians want a meir. But don't tell me - I want peace. Say how to achieve it, and what kind of peace should be achieved…. If the event stops supporting Ukraine, the war will end.

But if we stop helping, Russia will continue to squeeze to win the war, this war to occupy Kiev to turn Ukraine into a second Belarus. We will have Russian troops on the Polish border, the danger will increase dramatically, but Ukraine will no longer exist as a peaceful and independent state. This can happen, ”Josepborrel emphasized.</p>
<p>He stressed that the completion of Russian aggression against Ukraine is one of its tasks for the next 18 months. At the same time, Ukraine has to win, and Putin Russia is defeated.</p>

We have nothing against the Russian people, who also suffers from this mad idea, to invade Ukraine. It is excluding the responsibility of a person called Vladimir Putin. But not my business is to release how political processes will develop in Russia. My business is to support Ukraine, ”Josep Borrel added.</p>
<p>As it was reported, since the beginning of Russian military aggression in February 2022 the European Union and its Member States began to provide Ukraine with significant political, economic, financial, humanitarian and military assistance.

<p>This was announced today in Brussels during a discussion under the European Chief and Defense Summit and Defense Summit, the EU High Representative Josep Borrel, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“We must act very carefully and diplomatically so as not to push Russia in the arms and ask China to take advantage of our influence to stop the war.

At the same time, Beijing has already lost the opportunity to play the role of intermediary, since his "neutrality" in this war of Russia against Ukraine was rather pro -Russian. Meanwhile, according to the high representative of the EU, unlimited friendship between Russia and China has its limits.</p>
<p>“It is a kind of limited unlimited friendship. This couple is quite unbalanced: Russia has only 1 percent of world GDP - economically it can be compared, for example, with Italy or with Spain. China accounts for 20 percent of world GDP. Yes, China supports Russia, but it has not yet provided military assistance. We must be vigilant so as not to pushes Russia in China. But I don't think China feels very comfortable from what(in Russia)It happens, ”Borrel said.</p>

<p>His column under the heading "Vladimir Putin is the most dangerous fool of the Education" was published in the newspaper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/09/opinion/putin-ukraine-war.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare"></a>, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of this war, there was only one place where it is possible to understand her course of dissent - in the head of Vladimir Putin. Unfortunately, Putin does not issue a cart to his mash, ”Columnist said.</p>

<p>In his opinion, the Russian head began the war "almost without the participation of his capital or military command, and, of course, without mass calls from the side of the Russian people."</p>
<p>Putin has never had a plan B, as he thought he would capture Kyiv and continue to threaten all of Europe, Friedman says.</p>
<p>“<strong> <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin"></a></strong> He put himself in a situation, he cannot win, cannot lose and cannot stop, - the journalist said. - He can no longer capture control of all of Ukraine. Alevodes cannot afford to be defeated after spending only Russian lives and money. Therefore, he cannot stop. "</p>

<p>So Putin resorted to the shelling of Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure - the war for exhaustion, hoping that "he will be able to somehow deduce sufficient from Ukrainians and deplete Western allies of Kiev so much that they will give him a large enough piece of Russian -speaking Eastern Ukraine. Victory. "</p>
<p>Putin B plan is to mask what plan A has failed, the NYT Columnist concludes.</p>
<p>"If this military operation had an honest name, it would be called the surgery of" preserved face, "he said.</p>

<p>The author notes that because of the fear of his own people, Putin "grabs for any reason to justify the war he began through his personal fantasy that Ukraine is not a real country, but only part of Russia."</p>
<p>In particular, he is scared that after the war he will be remembered by the number of victims of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>Defense heads of the Union countries who held a meeting with the NATO format committee today identified the strategic directions for the development of the Alliance and confirmed the adamant support of Ukraine in its struggle for Russian aggression.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3707468-vijskovij-komitet-nato-pidtverdiv-nepohitnu-pidtrimku-ukraini.html">reports</a>Ukrinform, Admiral Rob Bauer, said the NATO headquarters today at a press conference at the NATO Headquarters.</p>
<p>NATO Military Committee is the highest body of the Alliance's military administration, which determines the needs of defense and development of the Armed Forces to ensure the collective defense of the Allies, to enforce political decisions in the country's leaders.</p>
<p>"The war that Russia has expected to complete in three days entered the fifteenth months. The growing determination and courage of the Ukrainian troops and the Ukrainian Narode continue to impress us. Today we have devoted a special session of the military situation in Ukraine and around it. The Ukrainian military representative provided detailed information on the situation on the ground, and outlined Ukraine to continue the struggle for what belongs to it by right, ”Admiral Bauer said.</p>
<p>"The heads of the South Defense have confirmed their unchanged support-there is no doubt that NATO will support Ukraine for as long as it is a budget," the head of the NATO Military Committee added.</p>
<p>He warned against false mistakes in evaluating Russia's behavior: it will not stop Ukraine, since its ambition goes far beyond the Russian borders. This is a manifestation in Abkhazia and North Ossetia, Transnistria and more. Once after all, she tried to violate the foundations of international order based on directions. It was she who pushed NATO to strengthen collective defense. Not only the Alliance and Ukraine, but all the free democracies of the world.</p>
<p>“The fundamental difference between response to crisis and collective defense is that we are not in defense, but our opponent defines the time frame. We must be ready for the fact that the conflict can be manifested at any time. It has been brought to this new era for years. We have monitored trends of the increasing aggressiveness in Russia's behavior. Together, we have made the most enhancement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War. But this work is not completed, ”the Alliance's military manager said.“All our efforts are focused on the political will of the Union countries with their military capabilities. This is more important now than ever before. The Russian aggressive war against Ukraine is the greatest threat to euro -Atlantic security for decades. Last year, it has changed lightly. NATO will continue to do what is best able to join, adapt and protect, ”Rob Bauer said.</p>
<p>He recalled that the Armed Forces of the Union countries now unite 3.2 million people in military uniforms, and they all work for the same purpose-reliably protection of a billion citizens living in the Alliance, the tadomocratic values they share. Their commitment and determination are a clear signal to the potential aggressor - NATO will protect every inch.</p>
<p>"It also indicates that together we are much stronger than alone," the Admiral said.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian invaders have not created a systematic support system, have suffered heavy losses, and now forced to use outdated equipment and uninvited people in large numbers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3707487-vijna-v-ukraini-dedali-silnise-protistavlatime-kilkist-akosti-admiral-bauer.html">reports</a>Ukrinform, the day before in Brussels, during a press conference following the meeting of the Defense of Defense of the Union countries, said the chairman of the Military Committee Natoadmiral Rob Bauer.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ukraine, according to him, focuses on the quality of forces and drunking of servicemen, uses weapons of Western samples, and this cut will be reflected on the battlefield over the following months.</p>
<p>“Any side in the war faces the same problems-loses people, has destroyed or damaged equipment, and feels a lack of ammunition. One of the award miscalculations that Russia was preparing for the three -day, "forgot" to inform the performers about its goals and could not expand the logistics system. So during the days they were left without fuel for the tank armies, ”said the Dutch Admiral Bauer.</p>
<p>He noted that in the conditions of fighting on the fourth or sixth day, they are transformed into a logistics competition, and this is what happens in Ukraine now. This is closely related to other problems-with the ability to replenish stools, receive new equipment, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles, tanks and combat vehicles new artillery systems and more. It is also about replenishing the personnel of the conscription or mobilization and its preparation.</p>
<p>“From a material point of view, the Russians began to use very old-materials and capabilities, for example, the T-54 tanks, the 1954 model, which we mibble on the battlefield. The problem is that they still have a lot of these-54. We see that the Russians are forced to focus on quantities. Including a large number of conscripts and mobilized people who are not well -known, they act on outdated materials, but in large numbers. Ukrainian, on the other hand, focused on quality, with weapons of the Western design, and as appropriate training for the military. This is a big difference that will have the manifestation of the next months, ”NATO's Military Committee said.“Logistics and logistics environment is a very important component(prompt - ed.)thinking. For many decades, we have neglected a large volume that would be associated with collective defense to a large -scale conflict - because we did not provide such a conflict. We planned smaller operations, which also had a significant logistics component, but were much more suitable for planning than war we see in Ukraine now, ”Rob Bauer said.</p>
<p>He stressed that the solution of such problems is not a matter of one day, it will interfere with large -scale and long efforts and investments, including in the development of the system of providing troops and logistics, improving the system of military management, etc. All this is at the heart of updated operational concepts on the modernization of the structure of troops and their provision, which will be considered during NATO -Samite in Vilnius.</p>
<p>In turn, the Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in the Europian American General Christopher Cavola noted that the Russian army should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>“I want to add that the degradation of the Russian Armed Forces is really unprecedented. Alevona concerns, above all, land forces, why we have very multifaceted. At the same time, it is worth remembering that in other areas, this degradation is much less noticeable, ”said the US military commander.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-11T53-00-00-04-00/ukraine_soldiers.jpg" />The Russian Federation should be clearly aware that it will never be able to defeat Ukraine.</p>

<p>“Over the last week, Russia has again inflicted massive rocket launchers from UAVs from settlements throughout Ukraine with minimal observance or compliance. It should be noted that on Monday, the Ukrainian red cross reported that as a result of <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/05/08/zagyblyj-ta-poraneni-vnaslidok-raketnyh-obstriliv-czyvilnyh-obyektiv-na-odeshhyni-prokurory-dokumentuyut-naslidky/">rocket mole</a>1000 square meters of humanitarian aid, which kept in the large warehouse of the Odessa region, were completely destroyed. Such attacks by Russian are directed to punish the Ukrainian people and sow terror. These are the marstoky acts of revenge and the shameful manifestation of the inability of Russian military protection, ”said Jan Stabbs, expressing during the OSCE meeting a strict transmission of Russia.</p>
<p>The UK's military adviser also emphasized the irony of false navigat of Russia on confrontation, taking into account its past actions.</p>
<p>"I would like to emphasize the irony that this was happening by the country that invaded Georgia in 2008, illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, and has begun a large -scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year," he said.</p>
<p>Jan Stabbs has confirmed the support of the United Kingdom of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Russia must realize that it will never be able to win in Ukraine. If it continues to fight, it will continue to lose. We are not underestimating a prolonged threat from the Russian Federation, but over time Ukraine will have a reason to celebrate. Ukraine will continue to demonstrate its decisiveness and unwavering moral force, struggling for the liberation of most of the homeland. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine will be fully restored. The United Kingdom and the International Security Company will remain adamant in support - we will support Ukraine as much as it does not need it, ”Jan Stabbs summarized.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-11T67-00-00-04-00/zaes.jpg" />"Energoatom" received information about the preparation of Russian invaders for "evacuation" from the satellite city of Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant(Rabbit)Almost 3100 people.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://t.me/energoatom_ua/13034">reports</a>SE "NNEGC" Energoatom ".</p>
<p>First of all, it is about the export of 2,700 station employees who have signed a contract with the fake AO "Explaining Organization of the Zaporozhye ACE" or other Rosatom's enterprise and their families.</p>
<p>At the same time, Energoatom reminds that the employees of the NPP departure from the city of Rashistisaboronized almost from the beginning of the occupation. Also, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, part of the family atomic atomicians have already been taken out of Energodar to the Rostov region of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Thus, the Russian invaders prove their inability to provide the operation of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, as it is now lacking in skilled personnel. Even those Ukrainian workers who, having signed the shameful contracts, agreed to cooperate with the ages, are going to "evacuate" in the near future. And this will exacerbate the very urgent issue of the presence of sufficient staff to ensure the safety of operations of the NPP, even in the current disconnected condition.</p>
<p>At the same time, Energoatom, for its part, takes all possible measures to formulate the required number of specialists who can ensure safe operation of the stations in the first period after its de -occupation. Such a team will be formed by the WEZ employees who are currently in the territory controlled by Ukraine, as well as specialists from other nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>"As soon as possible, the de -occupation of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, the expulsion of the racists from the energy and the transmission of control over the station of its legitimate Ukrainian operator, Energoatom, is the only way to stop the Russian disorder to tagua its further security," the statement reads.</p>

<p>This is the first time that NATO has developed such plans after the cold. These plans are part of the ten-year process of transformation of the Alliance, which is more united and united than ever.</p>
<p>“The United Kingdom undertakes to support Ukraine as much as it will be needed to protect itself from the illegal and unprovoked invasion of Russia. We are one of the leading military support suppliers for the Armory Forces of Ukraine and pledged to spend another 2.3 billion pototlings on Ukraine's military support this year. By taking on ourselves, we strengthen the position of Ukraine in the repeling barbaric invasion of the nuisance and ensure its long -term sovereignty, ”the presentation reads.</p>

<li>Currently, in the Black Sea, a hostile ship group is 10 casualties, including two surface rocket launchers. Rocket launchers are equipped with caliber missiles up to 16 units. These rockets are used by the occupiers only rarely on specific objects. If we take into account their last rocket launcher of 8 "calibers", then all of them - successfully shot down by our Air Force. You are obvious that they try to save their missiles. However, they do not stop terror against peaceful registration, - said Natalia Humeniuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to her, on land, the Russians take a lot of awkward steps without any systemic and logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Kherson direction, the enemy continues to fire us, feeling a powerful pressure on our part. Very tightly occupiers carry out a mine of the level of water of the left bank of the river and deep into their defense. In this way, they are to protect against the defense forces of Ukraine.
