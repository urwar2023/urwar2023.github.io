About it stated Secretary of the Radinational Security and Defense of Ukraine Alexey Danilov.
According to him, Russia is injection of the situation because it seeks to set up Ukraine as soon as possible at the negotiation table. To do this, the aggressor country launched a large campaign.

 This was stated by Estonia Prime Minister Kai Callas during the opening of Lennart Mary's 16-conference, correspondent Armyinfor from Tallinn reports.
"There is no responsibility for making Russia about its neighbors. So, in a short perspective, we must create an international tribunal against Russia. It should not be forgotten that there is also a crime of the Russian leadership. In fact, it is very important to deal with the crime of aggression.
For small states, such as the Baltic countries, the war is always destruction, and for imperials it is a glory.
For a while, I studied the history of tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo. Only during the Sevnurnberg did the Germans find out about the crimes of the Nazis. Therefore, not only responsibility is important, but also to the future, ”Kai Callas noted.
Lennart Mary Conference has been held annually in Estonia since 2007. Its organizer is the International Defense and Security Center(ICDS). Подія названа начесть міністра закордонних справ (1990–1992)and President of Estonia(1992–2001).

 This was stated by the Director of the International Defense and Security Center Indrek Kannik during the opening word at the opening of the 16th Lennart Mary Conference, the Army of Tallinn reports.
Indrek Kannik compared Ukraine a year ago and now, noting the strategic disaster of the Russians to destroy Ukrainian statehood.
“When we met a year ago at the 15th Lennart Mary Conference, large-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine was still quite early. Mennis three months from its beginning. But even then, there were signs that Russia had not yet been able to destroy Ukrainian statehood. The situation is unstable. Although Ukrainians were able to repel Russia's attack from the north, it was possible that Russia would regroup and return.
A year later, Ukraine liberated territories on the western bank of the Dnieper and most Kharkiv region. I am optimistic enough that Ukraine will free up more this summer. The situation is much better than it was a year ago. But it's not where we would like to be, ”said Indrek Kannik.
The slogan of the conference was the quote of the Italian writer Dante Alighieri "Incipitvita Nova"(So the new life begins). У цьому аспекті, на думкуІндрека Канніка, варто покарати росію через загарбницьку війну, щоб більше небуло воєн у Європі.
«Ми маємо зробити все, щоб зробити нове життя кращим, ніж нинішнє. Ми нехочемо війни на нашому континенті. Попереднє життя призвело нас до війни.
росія зараз, мабуть, найбільш слабка за останні 20 років. Будьмо чесними — мимаємо взяти перевагу в цій ситуації. росія розпочала загарбницьку війну. Вонавбила невинних людей, зруйнувала міста та села, знищила інфраструктуру тапам’ятки культури.
Нам не потрібно принижувати росію. Але ми маємо покарати її за те, що вонавчинила, — як карають злочинців. Кримінальні режими теж. Найкращим покараннямбуде швидка та чітка поразка росії та звільнення всіх українських територій.Цей результат так само в наших руках, як і в руках України», — відзначивІндрек Каннік.
За його словами, нині головним завданням є надання всебічної підтримки Українізадля якнайшвидшої перемоги. Адже російсько-українська війна впливає не лишена Європу, але й решту світу.
«З нашою допомогою, з нашою зброєю, Україна зможе виграти в цій війні. Післявійни безпека України та наша безпека мають бути гарантовані українськимчленством у ЄС і НАТО, разом з іншими націями, які цього прагнуть.

In general, the US is doing everything to ensure Ukrainian victory in the war (Increasing. - Ed.) . The war began in February 2014. I think that the idea that the United States would spend $ 37 billion on military assistance for any country for 15 months could not imagine even those who supported Ukraine.

He assured that the support of the United States for Ukraine will continue both in the provision of security assistance and in condemning Russian military crimes in Ukraine. The diplomat also recalled that Ukrainians are fighting, quoting the Ukrainian poet Sergei Zhadan.

 _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today - in Rome. As always with such visits, there is a result. Today we are more consistent.
He met with the President of Italy and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers - a political level of meetings. He heard that Italy would continue the support of Ukraine - as much as we need to stand and protect our people, our territory.
We agree with George, Ms. Prime Minister, our new joint defense tracks. There are good things that we will do together to protect the sky. There are good things to do together for protection on Earth. They agreed on weapons and air defense. As George, she said, when we defend the freedom and our lives of sprout bombs and rockets in Ukraine, from terror, we are giving the war from the rest of Europe.
Today, Russian murderers took away the lives of another Ukrainian child - the girl, she was not 16 years old. Her name was Hope ... A man was also killed, 64 was killed. Just ordinary people from the ordinary city of Konstantinovka in the Donbass ... My condolences to their relatives and loved ones!
It was a Russian strike of jet artillery. Just on the streets - on houses, shops, pharmacy and warehouse. This is how Russia is fighting. Artillery against ordinary people, against any people-children or adults, men or women. And to stop only with strong weapons, which our warriors can expel evil. To expel that the Kremlin could not spread aggression to other peoples of Europe.
Today, I had the honor to personally thank Rome, all of Italy, Mrs. Meloni as well and everyone in the Italian political class, who honestly responds to the threat to all our European way of life.
He met the Pope Francis, and it was a conversation that could really influence history, can really help stop the evil of aggression.
I told about the crimes committed by Russian invaders against our people, the provision of Ukrainian children. Even the exact number, how many children stole from Ukraine and hides from relatives, from Ukraine somewhere there in a foreign country. He asked his holiness to help return our children home to Ukraine.
He also told about other points of our peace formula, except for the return of all deported and captives. And I believe that the will and sincerity of its holiness can not be the realization of our formula of peace, can bring a fair, honest, honest.By the way, Italy today clearly supported all the points of Ukrainian formula. I thank you for that.
There is also a joint declaration with Italy. All important things: the European Union-Italy maintained negotiations in the 23rd year, the correct and timely signals of Zamoto.
And one more. I am especially grateful to all those people who were on the streets of Rome are famous for Ukrainian flags who met a Ukrainian delegation with an open -hearth and genuine good emotion ... Italy should always be on the side of good to get ready in Europe!
Viva Italia!
Glory to our soldiers!
Thank you to our air forces and all air defense fighters of other types and families of troops!
Glory to Ukraine!
