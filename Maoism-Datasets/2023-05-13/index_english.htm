<p>Thanks to the mine of the Bozena-5 demining in many settlements, Kharkiv region has renewed electricity. It is used precisely on the grounds that are used for immediate demining, for example, areas where there are lines of electric programs. Thus, the combat calculation of this machine has already cleared from the GNP the preducified territories of the communities of Slobozhanshchina 215,639 km of transmission lines.</p>
<p>About it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=573598081528021">reports</a>Command of Forces of Support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>A representative of the Department of Engineering Forces Department of Supporting Armed Forces of Ukraine spoke about the experience of using the BOZENA-5 mine-5 demining machine, which was used for Ukraine by the Slovak company Way Industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>This machine saves the lives of the sappers, they do not go first, but actually pick up. It is effective and fast, and if you speak from the context of mine, it justifies itself, - said the representative of the Command of Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Background: The machine is intended for demining potentially contaminated with a hazardous objects. It can be used to cleanse protintanka and anti -personnel mine fields.</p>
<p>Any demining means is a powerful contribution to the process of purifying terminals, because it is remote-rooted, and the speed of passage reaches 9 kilometers per hour. The complex is accompanied by a demining group of 5 people, 2 of them with metal detectors to fully monitor the situation, 2 collect the stakes, and the commander who controls the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be understood that no mechanized tool gives a guarantee that there will be no explosive object. That is why any demining is followed by a group of sappers, which chooses these remains from the soil. That is, the main merit of Bozena-5 is that it makes it impossible for the undermining of a proof object, although it leaves the explosives in the soil. It also plays a role in which type of working organ is used: chain or fighter. In the latter, rigid fighting structures that bring mine or any other GNP into action or break up our places, which represent the remains of an explosive substance,-said support representative of support forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems with these samples of equipment are still insufficient base for post -warranty service.</p>

<p>"There is no responsibility for making Russia about its neighbors. So, in a short perspective, we must create an international tribunal against Russia. It should not be forgotten that there is also a crime of the Russian leadership. In fact, it is very important to deal with the crime of aggression.</p>
<p>For small states, such as the Baltic countries, the war is always destruction, and for imperials it is a glory.</p>
<p>For a while, I studied the history of tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo. Only during the Sevnurnberg did the Germans find out about the crimes of the Nazis. Therefore, not only responsibility is important, but also to the future, ”Kai Callas noted.</p>

<p>Indrek Kannik compared Ukraine a year ago and now, noting the strategic disaster of the Russians to destroy Ukrainian statehood.</p>
<p>“When we met a year ago at the 15th Lennart Mary Conference, large-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine was still quite early. Mennis three months from its beginning. But even then, there were signs that Russia had not yet been able to destroy Ukrainian statehood. The situation is unstable. Although Ukrainians were able to repel Russia's attack from the north, it was possible that Russia would regroup and return.</p>
<p>A year later, Ukraine liberated territories on the western bank of the Dnieper and most Kharkiv region. I am optimistic enough that Ukraine will free up more this summer. The situation is much better than it was a year ago. But it's not where we would like to be, ”said Indrek Kannik.</p>
<p>The slogan of the conference was the quote of the Italian writer Dante Alighieri "Incipitvita Nova"(So the new life begins). У цьому аспекті, на думкуІндрека Канніка, варто покарати росію через загарбницьку війну, щоб більше небуло воєн у Європі.</p>
<p>«Ми маємо зробити все, щоб зробити нове життя кращим, ніж нинішнє. Ми нехочемо війни на нашому континенті. Попереднє життя призвело нас до війни.</p>
<p>росія зараз, мабуть, найбільш слабка за останні 20 років. Будьмо чесними — мимаємо взяти перевагу в цій ситуації. росія розпочала загарбницьку війну. Вонавбила невинних людей, зруйнувала міста та села, знищила інфраструктуру тапам’ятки культури.</p>
<p>Нам не потрібно принижувати росію. Але ми маємо покарати її за те, що вонавчинила, — як карають злочинців. Кримінальні режими теж. Найкращим покараннямбуде швидка та чітка поразка росії та звільнення всіх українських територій.Цей результат так само в наших руках, як і в руках України», — відзначивІндрек Каннік.</p>
<p>За його словами, нині головним завданням є надання всебічної підтримки Українізадля якнайшвидшої перемоги. Адже російсько-українська війна впливає не лишена Європу, але й решту світу.</p>
<p>«З нашою допомогою, з нашою зброєю, Україна зможе виграти в цій війні. Післявійни безпека України та наша безпека мають бути гарантовані українськимчленством у ЄС і НАТО, разом з іншими націями, які цього прагнуть.</p>
<p>We will remind, on May 12 in the capital of Estonia, Tallinna began its work 16-conference Lennart Mary-an annual event, where they discuss issues of international security. The correspondent of the Armyinforms exclusively reports the main discussions that are happening there.

<p>Today - in Rome. As always with such visits, there is a result. Today we are more consistent.</p>
<p>He met with the President of Italy and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers - a political level of meetings. He heard that Italy would continue the support of Ukraine - as much as we need to stand and protect our people, our territory.</p>
<p>We agree with George, Ms. Prime Minister, our new joint defense tracks. There are good things that we will do together to protect the sky. There are good things to do together for protection on Earth. They agreed on weapons and air defense. As George, she said, when we defend the freedom and our lives of sprout bombs and rockets in Ukraine, from terror, we are giving the war from the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Today, Russian murderers took away the lives of another Ukrainian child - the girl, she was not 16 years old. Her name was Hope ... A man was also killed, 64 was killed. Just ordinary people from the ordinary city of Konstantinovka in the Donbass ... My condolences to their relatives and loved ones!</p>
<p>It was a Russian strike of jet artillery. Just on the streets - on houses, shops, pharmacy and warehouse. This is how Russia is fighting. Artillery against ordinary people, against any people-children or adults, men or women. And to stop only with strong weapons, which our warriors can expel evil. To expel that the Kremlin could not spread aggression to other peoples of Europe.</p>
<p>Today, I had the honor to personally thank Rome, all of Italy, Mrs. Meloni as well and everyone in the Italian political class, who honestly responds to the threat to all our European way of life.</p>
<p>He met the Pope Francis, and it was a conversation that could really influence history, can really help stop the evil of aggression.</p>
<p>I told about the crimes committed by Russian invaders against our people, the provision of Ukrainian children. Even the exact number, how many children stole from Ukraine and hides from relatives, from Ukraine somewhere there in a foreign country. He asked his holiness to help return our children home to Ukraine.In the evening, from Rome, I spoke with the President of the South African Republic. He spoke of the formula of peace, justice, that our light is united by the rules of international law. Anyone who assists a weapon will be an accomplice with all the consequences. He called on Panap President to join with other countries of the world, all continents, Africa jointly for the realization of our formula of peace.</p>
<p>By the way, Italy today clearly supported all the points of Ukrainian formula. I thank you for that.</p>
<p>There is also a joint declaration with Italy. All important things: the European Union-Italy supported the negotiations in the 23rd year, the correct and timely signals of Zamoto.</p>
<p>And one more. I am especially grateful to all those people who were on the streets of Rome are famous for Ukrainian flags who met a Ukrainian delegation with an open -hearth and a genuine good emotion ... Italy should always be on the side of good, so that remained in Europe!</p>
<p>Viva Italia!</p>

When you are on television, on the Internet, the vagina says that Russia is your brother, and Ukraine is an enemy, it is difficult to live in this narrative. But they are fighting, and I believe that the society of Belarusian is independent. It is difficult, it is also a war, because they have no casualties, but there are lost people who washed the brain, it is also a war for independence, freedom of speech, freedom of choice, it is a great war for the same values, ”Zelensky reinforced.</p>

<p>Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/die-ukraine-muss-im-westen-verankert-werden-gastbeitrag-a-c1523b06-2364-4a88-b143-b2a96f4f557e?sara_ref=re-so-app-sh"></a>, reports Ukrinform with reference to <a href="https://t.me/ermaka2022/2640"></a> <a href="https://t.me/ermaka2022/2640"></a>Yermak.</p>
<p>"Putin must understand that the commitment of the democratic world to Ukraine will not be paid that his war is meaningless. Therefore, the heads of state and government of the countries <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-nato"></a>They should support the safety pact and show the path to the Alliance membership. If they do it now, it will help the president Vladimir Zelensky to start the process of building a just Taturist peace. On the other hand, the Kremlin will continue its illegitimate war, ”he wrote.</p>
<p>Yermak noted that Ukraine's membership in NATO would ensure the absence of war. In words, the contribution of Ukraine to collective security can be one of the largest of all Member States at the expense of an experienced and motivated army, as well as the skillful use of NATO weapons.</p>
<p>"In the future, the Summit in Vilnius NATO leaders should send a clear signal that the game is over. That Ukraine is part of the event. It is time to determine the specific plans and prospects of Ukraine's accession to NATO. Finland Tashveti has shown that no action is required to join," Yermak emphasized.</p>
<p>Also, the head of the Presidential Office recalled that last year the developed security contract was determined, which defines a number of security guarantees for Ukraine from its allies. In particular, the indefinite obligation of the Garant States Group to provide weapons, joint military exercises under the EU Flags, the exchange of intelligence and the continuation of investments in the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. The implementation of these measures is the support that will ensure the winner in this war and eliminate further aggression of Russia.</p>
<p>"There is no safety in the gray zone between NATO and Russia. Finland and Sweden were recognized. We need clarity, not the repetition of the open door policy that has just repelled the gate for Russian aggression," Yermak stressed.At the same time, he stated that the supply of Leopard 2 tanks, Patriot Iiris-T missiles, provided by the Federal Government of Germany and Chancellor Olaf Soltz, significantly improved the situation at the front. Yermak expressed his gratitude to the German Narod for military assistance and refugee shelves.</p>

When you are on television, on the Internet, the vagina says that Russia is your brother, and Ukraine is an enemy, it is difficult to live in this narrative. But they are fighting, and I believe that the society of Belarusian is independent. It is difficult, it is also a war, because they have no casualties, but there are lost people who washed the brain, it is also a war for independence, freedom of speech, freedom of choice, it is a great war for the same values, ”Zelensky reinforced.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Belarusians understand that they can be the following for Russian aggression, Moldova or Baltic countries.</p>

Voice-over. General ”once again stressed that it began with Russia for Ukraine long before February 24, namely in 2014. Answering the question of how Ukraine managed to stand, Valery Zaluzhnuzhni said that such a question is not usual for him, because we have been giving a respective time for 9 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you answer the question of how we stood… It is a little unusual for me as a military. Apparently, even a little unpleasant. Why? Because at least I very often said this in my few interviews. The main impressions for me were in the summer of 2014. The war began for me in person. And it was then that the war began for the Kadro military, with whom we started this large -scale war, the alnivon lasted for us exactly 8 years until February 24, when its scale changed, - said the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also repeatedly emphasized that Ukraine was ready for a duty scenario, because for 8 years before the start of a large -scale interruption on the front, people were killed, as well as injured, Taxama lasted fighting.</p>
<ul>
<li>To say that there was something unusual, and something was remembered that it was in the heart, apparently not.

<ul>
<li>If you answer the question of how we stood… It is a little unusual for me as a military. Apparently, even a little unpleasant. Why? Because at least I very often said this in my few interviews. The main impressions for me were in the summer of 2014. The war began for me in person. And it was then that the war began for the Kadro military, with whom we started this large -scale war, the alnivon lasted for us exactly 8 years until February 24, when its scale changed, - said the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces.</li>

<p>-I analyzed all the possible actions in my head, sometimes it became very, very difficult, but it prompted me and my team, the General Staff, including the commanders, to look for options for how to act in such conditions when it would be prevailed by the opponent. When it is an offensive in almost all directions, and it will be quite powerful and quite rapid. Somewhere in the end of February, apparently, we have already exhausted all the possibilities from our imagination that could be made, "Valery Zaluzhny told.</p>

Behind the frame General ”told the head of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, General Valery Zaluzhny, answering the question, however, that helps us to give a decent repel of the enemy and what actions will help us to come to the desired victory faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, military science is quite extensive, and every victory of ESVA components. There is a lot of "if it were", "if it were so", and in fact, much missing. I see how it is possible to do it, I see how to do it, but I know for sure that the victory is still a very, very distant way. I hope that God is on our side, and the winner will definitely be for us. As of today, what is happening, and what we hold on to be Ukrainian people, a Ukrainian soldier, a Ukrainian state, a Ukrainian officer who die daily, crippled, but keep their own names. And today they make this victory. This is the only phenomenon that allows you to beat so far. It is our Ukrainian people, who was put in such a manner, when he clearly understood that people from the territory of the Russian Federation or Belarus to come to his wife, his children, came to destroy his building. And here these people are crowded with the idea of protecting their relatives, their loved ones, their family ... It was they who did it. Well, of course, the commanders they believed. Commanders who are Viryliswa's commanders. Commanders who believed to me that we were taking the right thing, - said General Valery Zaluzhny.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces noted that, unfortunately, we have already lost very crowds, soldiers, sergeants and commanders who had the skills and extensive experience of hostilities.</p>
<p>-This is a feature of any war-the war begins the military, the teachers, engineers, accountants begin ... Actually, what is happening now. I very much hope that over time, not only human life and health will be the basis of this victory, but also It will be the use of advanced technologies: more efficient insurgents, more efficient technology. We will definitely come and win, but so far everything is holding on the shoulders of these ordinary people, - said Valery Zaluzhny.</p>

<ul>
<li>In my opinion, the strategic goal of the Russian Federation was to reduce Ukrainian statehood as such. Apparently, they were counting on organized columns, people will meet them with bread and salt and this Ukrainian statehood will end. When the Ukrainians began to resist, when the Ukrainians began to defend themselves, as of today, they consciously eat in order to deliberately kill Ukrainians, it was to kill, - Valeriusluzhny said.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces has repeatedly emphasized that the essence of this war is that "we will fight for the last drop of blood", and in the rest - the Ukrainian state will be destroyed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The essence of this war is that if we do not kill this enemy now, we will be destroyed. Because they came consciously, although they now carry frantic experts, including in the Donetsk operational direction, in the Bakhmut area, but still go to kill Ukrainians. This is their goal. It is strange that it happens in the 21st century, it is strange that it happens in an era when science is developed, when there are grandparents in memory, who survived the Second World War, but despite this, they are consciously killing Ukrainians. We will fight a lot of blood, because otherwise they will kill us. There is no other. Everything is simple, - summed up the Commander -in -Chief of the Armed Forces.</li>

<p>According to the officer, it is never possible to underestimate his opponent. Russian -shaped ones learn quickly, they are prepared and even in some way motivated, because in their brains for years "pumped" propaganda.</p>
<p>"Those genes that we, the Ukrainians, are our desire to defend our country, intolerance to another's boots on our earth give us inspiration, power of imposition to destroy the Russian enemy," the brigade commander adds.</p>

<p>This was stated by the Head of Policy Planning Office under the Secretary-General Benedett Benedett during a discussion on security in Northern Europe at the 16th-conference of Lennart Mary, reports Armyinfor from Tallinn.</p>
<p>Finland has become a member of NATO on April 4, and Sweden is expected to enter the Alliance. Security in Northern Europe is directly related to Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Benedetta Berti noted that there would be more consultations with Sweden Tafinland.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Alliance observes Russia's military strengthening in the Arctic. I think there will be more NATO consultations as to the increasing importance of the regional region as such. This also applies to Sweden and Finland, which will also be attached to political consultations on Russia's military consequences in the Arctic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arctic is a region where Russia's military capabilities are not involved in Ukraine. We look at the Arctic as a zone of geopolitical rivalry, ”Benedett Benedette stated.</p>
<p>With the awareness of the importance of the Arctic, NATO is already working on deployment in the region.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a clear understanding that this region is <em>(Arctic. - Ed.)</em> will be the most more and it will have consequences for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the point of view of what we do to know more about the situation, there are NATO -wide exercises. For example, the deployment of the Alliance in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Nowadays, NATO Arctic Strategy is not present, ”Benedetta Berry summarized.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ukrainians will determine what victory is. Ukraine needs to win the war. I would like to be that the selected Ukrainian leaders will be those who will determine the end of the war after the victory of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the US is doing everything to ensure Ukrainian victory in the war <em>(Increasing. - Ed.)</em>. The war began in February 2014. I think that the idea that the United States would spend $ 37 billion on military assistance for any country for 15 months could not imagine even those who supported Ukraine.</p>
<p>For example, the US has spent $ 72 billion in Afghanistan for 20 years, assisting the Afghan security forces. And we gave half of this amount in 15 months <em>(large -scale Russian aggression against Ukraine. —The ed.)</em>, - said George Kent.</p>
<p>He assured that the support of the United States for Ukraine will continue both in the provision of security assistance and in condemning Russian military crimes in Ukraine. The diplomat also recalled that Ukrainians are fighting, quoting the Ukrainian poet Sergei Zhadan.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Secretary of State Blinken talked to the Minister of Kuleba yesterday. Our support for Ukraine is becoming an offensive on the battlefield. Ukrainians who die there <em>(in the war. —The ed.)</em>, fight for freedom. They live for the best country to be the best country. Because Ukraine _ --<em> is Europe, as well as Crimea _ --</em> it is Ukraine, _ --_ summarized the community of Kent.</li>
</ul>
<p>On May 12, the 16th conferences of Mary-Annual Event, which is discussed by international security, the conference was discussed in honor of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the capital of Estonia Tallinn.(1990-1992.)Estonia's tap(1992–2001.).

<p>Today - in Rome. As always with such visits, there is a result. Today we are more consistent.</p>
<p>He met with the President of Italy and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers - a political level of meetings. He heard that Italy would continue the support of Ukraine - as much as we need to stand and protect our people, our territory.</p>
<p>We agree with George, Ms. Prime Minister, our new joint defense tracks. There are good things that we will do together to protect the sky. There are good things to do together for protection on Earth. They agreed on weapons and air defense. As George, she said, when we defend the freedom and our lives of sprout bombs and rockets in Ukraine, from terror, we are giving the war from the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Today, Russian murderers took away the lives of another Ukrainian child - the girl, she was not 16 years old. Her name was Hope ... A man was also killed, 64 was killed. Just ordinary people from the ordinary city of Konstantinovka in the Donbass ... My condolences to their relatives and loved ones!</p>
<p>It was a Russian strike of jet artillery. Just on the streets - on houses, shops, pharmacy and warehouse. This is how Russia is fighting. Artillery against ordinary people, against any people-children or adults, men or women. And to stop only with strong weapons, which our warriors can expel evil. To expel that the Kremlin could not spread aggression to other peoples of Europe.</p>
<p>Today, I had the honor to personally thank Rome, all of Italy, Mrs. Meloni as well and everyone in the Italian political class, who honestly responds to the threat to all our European way of life.</p>
<p>He met the Pope Francis, and it was a conversation that could really influence history, can really help stop the evil of aggression.</p>
<p>I told about the crimes committed by Russian invaders against our people, the provision of Ukrainian children. Even the exact number, how many children stole from Ukraine and hides from relatives, from Ukraine somewhere there in a foreign country. He asked his holiness to help return our children home to Ukraine.</p>
<p>He also told about other points of our peace formula, except for the return of all deported and captives. And I believe that the will and sincerity of its holiness can not be the realization of our formula of peace, can bring a fair, honest, honest.By the way, Italy today clearly supported all the points of Ukrainian formula. I thank you for that.</p>
<p>There is also a joint declaration with Italy. All important things: the European Union-Italy maintained negotiations in the 23rd year, the correct and timely signals of Zamoto.</p>
<p>And one more. I am especially grateful to all those people who were on the streets of Rome are famous for Ukrainian flags who met a Ukrainian delegation with an open -hearth and genuine good emotion ... Italy should always be on the side of good to get ready in Europe!</p>
<p>Viva Italia!</p>
<p>Glory to our soldiers!</p>
<p>Thank you to our air forces and all air defense fighters of other types and families of troops!</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em></strong></p>
