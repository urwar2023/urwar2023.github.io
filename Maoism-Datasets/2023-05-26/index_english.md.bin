Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin spent an online meeting with members of the UK Parliament Committee. In his speech, he thanked the concern and continuous support of Ukraine.

“An example of such assistance is an advisory group on the most severe in -international crimes - AtroCity Crimes Advisory Group(ACA), one of the founders of which is the United Kingdom. It was created to support the office prosecutor in the investigation and judicial prosecution of military and violations of international humanitarian law, committed as a result of an incorporated and illegal Russian war.

Recently, the UK Embassy in Poland has hosted the ACA leaders forum, which helped determine priorities and future initiatives.

We appreciate the personal involvement of highly respected Victoria Pntis, its assignment to restoring justice and ensuring the responsibility of horrific crimes of the Russian Federation. The world community is united in the desire to punish the guilty committing serious international crimes, ”Andrei Kostin stated.

He also noted that international support and unity are necessary to win the legal front and the restoration of peace in Europe and the world.

The headquarters representative assured that there is no queue for exchange. Ukrainian is releasing everyone on the least occasion: “We have not yet returned all wounded. That is, if it was the turn, only the wounded and women would still be returned. The dialogue goes not about military units or units, but rather in categories: wounded, sick, elderly, women, places of maintenance. But in fact we return the other. If we insisted on our order of exchange, we would not have been able to liberate more than 2.3 thousand people. A maximum of half a thousand. "

The meeting also discussed what relatives can do to the official confirmation of the captivity of their defenders. In particular, it is necessary to contact the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICCH). Хоча цене гарантує позитивного результату.

«На росіян зараз можна впливати тільки силою. МКЧХ — гуманітарна організація,вона не застосовує силу, а тільки переконання й нагадування. Томупідтвердження залежить від країни-агресорки. Росія зобов’язана підтверджуватиполон людей, яких захопила, й надавати їм відповідні права», — зазначивпредставник Штабу.

Також він запевнив, що всі відео, які викладає ворог з нашими полоненими,беруться в роботу для підтвердження й визволення наших Оборонців: «Миобліковуємо всю інформацію про полонених — у тому числі свідченнях тих, хтоповернувся. Використовуємо все для визволення наших людей».

The head of Ukrainian diplomacy told Portuguese partners in detail at the front and outlined the military needs of Ukraine for effective defense and counter -offensive operations.

In this connection, Dmytro Kuleba expressed his gratitude to the Portugal government for the decision to join the aviation coalition by training Ukrainian pilots of Tamhechanics on Western fighting aircraft.

The Portuguese side also confirmed his willingness to support Ukraine's path to membership in the European Union.

The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and Portugal coordinated positions in the context of preparation for NATO summit in Vilnius. Dmytro Kuleba emphasized the importance of the political decision to determine the algorithm of Ukraine's accession to the Alliance.

The ministers also discussed the prosecution of Russia and its reference for crimes against Ukraine, including the creation of a special tribunal on aggression.

Dmytro Kuleba also paid special attention to the formula of the President Vladimrazellensky peace as a path to establishing a just and long -term peace in Ukraine, expanding its circle of support, in particular through the accession of the countries of the global south.

In order for the Russians to go more actively to the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and fought against Ukraine, they are promised earthen areas.

About it [reports](https://sprotyv.mod.gov.ua/rosijskym-vijskovym-obitsyayut-zemelni-dilyanky-na-tot/)Center for National Resistance.

“Occupation administrations are actively“ nationalizing ”farm lands, which are left by the owners. Thus, in the temporarily occupied territories, Russians squeeze private property. Instead, they promise to distribute individual identities to the Russian military as a reward for participating in the war against Ukraine, ”the message reads.

Large farms have already been transferred under the curatories of the false persons who control local gowiers. Thus, in the Kherson region, large farms are transferred to man by a collaborator of the balance, who wants to monopolize grain from the south of Ukraine.

According to the headquarters, criminal cases, initiated by the prosecutors, or the "sentences" of the courts of the aggressor country, which can be obtained from various sources, is not a obstacle to involvement in the exchange processes. Proterous captivity is returned both "convicts" and those who continue the "investigation" in the Russian Federation or temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories. The same applies to the missing persons: all who are introduced to the Unified Register of the National Information Bureau involved in the exchange processes.

A separate block of questions concerned the search and return of the bodies of the fallen defenders. As Ivan Angelin, a representative of the office of the Commissioner for Persons missing in special circumstances, the work of search groups began after the de -occupation and demining of a certain territory. It is dangerous to send search groups there before carrying out the appropriate preparation procedures. He added that the office receives an information about the probable places of burials from various sources: both Vrivka, from the police, and from the local population.

As for the information about the directions from which the bodies of the dead soldiers return, Mr Angelin noted that representatives of the Russian side provide very generally information about it, so it is difficult to find out which location has returned from our defenders. The final confirmation is given by the already relevant expertise. He also urged his relatives to pass to the office to know information about the probable places of disappearance of servicemen.

And it was the determination of the main directions in the defense sector that was devoted to the largest conference of the state and Eastern Europe_ _defence_ _24_ _day_ _ _, which took place in the capital of Warsaw._

It is a matter of mind that, given the desperate and bloody struggle, our country will now be with Russian aggressors, the main attention of participants in the international conference was attracted to issues related to the heroic opposing Ukrainian people. And in this sense, our foreign partners were very interesting and relevant to hear the opinion and specific meaningful proposals of the Deputy Aminist of Ukraine's Defense Anna Malyar._

### ** About "Antipytinists" and hybrid effects on the part of the Russians **

In her opinion, the result of Russian aggression against free and independent Ukraine was the very fact that the so -called Eastern neighbor could not have managed to give in the spirit of imperialism. And, despite the fact that more than 30 years of moving to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Empires can still not be reconciled with this objective historical fact, Ukraine consider Ukraine the best of the former USSR and through its conquest try to restore their unobstructed.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49.jpeg)According to Anna Malyar, in her desire of the Russian Federation uses any methods, in particular, trying to influence Europeans through financing political parties.Of course, in her speech, Anna Malyar not only stated the fact of one of the deputies by the Russian Federation. First of all, she reminded the participants of the conference that in the European countries and in America and in the Ukrainian Ukrainians, the so -called experts who allegedly opposed Putin have been growing and funding for years, and now, when the Warning War was ongoing, they have stood on its side and for some reason. At the same time, the trust of millions of citizens. Therefore, in her opinion, that Russia could not use this hybrid information instrument of influence through free access to the information space with developed democracy, the Western world must be as much as possible and consolidated in the fight against totalitarian Russia and not allow it to be possible.

### ** About the phenomenon of Ukrainian force **

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/03_ukr-scaled.jpg)Photo: Poglyad.tv

As for the very fact of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, as the Deputy Minister of Defense emphasized, such a step is different, as a great foolishness from the Russians, it is impossible to call. After all, since 2014, when fighting against Russian invaders in the east of our country began, the Ukrainian army gained enormous combat experience. It is to break the enemy from such adventure and madness, and the Ukrainians were convinced that the Russians were well aware that we cannot be overcome that we would still win them.

“They would have first remembered our history. For example, in the same Soviet prisoners, the vast majority of political prisoners were Ukrainians who have not been not free from the totalitarian Soviet system for all over 70 years of its existence and proved by their struggle that we were not slaves. However, there was a very terrible war that could never be imagined and that it was impossible to prepare for people who are not some savages but bearers and civilization. Today, Ukraine is the object. Our warriors are hardened by the poor with Russia. And the phenomenon of the strength of Ukrainians consists of a whole complex of different manifestations, factors and circumstances, - said Anna Malyar.

### ** About the President, Government and Departure from Bureaucracy **

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.50.jpeg)- I have repeatedly witnessed the casual situation with the warriors on the front line. And after that, people with more inspiration will fight the enemy. It was the first at the beginning of a large -scale Russian invasion at the beginning of a large -scale invasion, which inspired all the Ukrainians to fight the aggressor, - said Anna Malyar.

### ** About the Defenders of Ukraine and the historical chance to win Russia **

It is indisputable to the very fact that even before the start of a large -scale war, the Ukrainian army served powerful vocational military service, many of which were trained in NATO standards. But the Great Invasion requires constant replenishment of human resources. Today in the trenches near Bakhmut and other areas of the Russian-Ukrainian Fronte are representatives of many purely civilian professions-farmers, doctors of sciences, business owners, singers ...

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/e2teus-c4x3x50px50p-c4x3x50px50p-9e8d88dd767753d844f8f51373962f03.jpg)- In general, these are hundreds of thousands of mobilized persons. And today they all bring them together, everywhere we all have a historical chance to put a point in this 400 years of war. As they say, now we have all the stars. There is a powerful army, there are no political strife that have always destroyed our country, and we finally managed to unblood the subversive activities of Russian special services, ”Anna Malyar said.

In her opinion, such unity, as now, has never been to counteract Russia. Israz together we pass that historical peak, when a real chansous jerk appeared to finally end this country with the aggressor. All the prerequisites for this. There is no one to be afraid. For example, the Ukrainian military leadership is much more professional than Russian. We plan combat operations according to modern standards, and they - by the old Soviet ones. We also have the bureaucracy of the VSKskaya less and much more freedom to make decisions by representatives of the team units.

- Yes, the Russians have already realized it, and they try to change something in this direction, but they do not succeed, - stated the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

### ** About our unity and Russian narratives **

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49-2.jpeg)- For example, the Russians have seen how powerful in these difficult times the Poland helps Ukraine and how strategically it strengthens us with you. But for them, Dobrostidu partner Polish-Ukrainian relations are a threat. Through the tevons, any methods are used to quarrel our multimillion innasters. For example, they begin to say that the Poles are not satisfied with the behavior of Ukrainians who went to Poland through the war. In response to the same social networks, a Ukrainian may be unpleasant to the Poles. That is, Russia launches narratives that can adjust us against each other. In particular, they also dive into expert discussions about our past and try to state that we have become antagonists again. That is, they work through social, because it is the driving force of power. But Ukrainians have become much more in the information space, understanding how Russian propaganda operates and do not believe in these narratives. And it is very important that the Poles are well aware. Our main task is to be stable in this information space and to constantly explain to people so that they do not perceive the props. We are friendly peoples and together we are strong!- said Hannamal.

### ** About Bakhmut's Defense and Release of Territories **

During the International Conference on Defense and Security, the Deputy Ministry of Defense of Ukraine also spoke with representatives of the media. Of course, all the journalists were interested in the issue of counter -confronted and defense actions by Ukrainian defense forces.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/bachmutas-92544239.jpg)Photo: AP / Scanpix

In this context, Anna Malyar explained that in general, from the beginner -scale Russian invasion, our country is in a defense state, which in turn includes various measures. And if in the east, Ukrainian military is mainly defended against the Russian invasion, then the other areas carry out active assault and offensive actions.

According to her, the defense of Bakhmut remains a separate and heroic page of the up -to -date history of Ukraine and the most expensive battle for Russian invaders, which have suffered great losses in weapons, equipment and personnel.She also stressed that the Bakhmut battle allowed Ukrainians to solve several martial tasks. In particular, thanks to the defense of the city, it has been struck from the summer of last year, it was possible to cause great losses of the enemy and divided one of his most professional groups among the mercenaries of the Wagner PEC. And secondly, it made it possible to reduce the offensive potential of the Russians, who, having concentrated their efforts there, could not use it on other preferences.

"In general, we do not divide our lands" more important. " For us, each of its kilometer is native and strategically important, because our ultimate goal is to slow down all temporarily occupied territories. Therefore, of course, we will only move forward, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

### ** About the need for weapons and hostile missile attacks **

At the same time, many weapons are needed to accelerate this process. And, answering the questions of journalists, Anna Malyar said that among the priorities - to obtain a modern long -range weapons about the number of Russia, unfortunately, today there is still an advantage.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-25T68-00-00-04-00/whatsapp-image-2023-05-25-at-10.35.49-3.jpeg)In addition, she said, today the Russians are able to launch missiles of the fortune of the territory of Ukraine.

- And such rockets are a hundred a day. To close the sky and protect civilians, we need powerful anti -missile complexes and modern combat aviation, which will allow us to break the course of the war. And we will be very grateful for providing such necessary help, - said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

### ** About Poland that is known in trouble and joint counteraction to the aggressor **

Of course, both in this and in the humanitarian aspects, Ukraine greatly appreciates the assistance of the parties of many European countries and is gratefully grateful for this to such a large -scale and strategic partner as Poland.

- Since February 2022, in a few weeks, hundreds of thousands of people had to mobilize. And, of course, the system of former military enlistment offices, and now the territorial centers of manning and social support, was not ready for such a way. At the same time, the obligation to defend its state in the Constitution is prescribed for all citizens of Ukraine. Of course, communication on a mobilization campaign should be clear, respectful for humans. Also, we need to understand that there is a good or bad military, if you have a Ukrainian passport, you have this constitutional duty, ”Hannamaars said.

We fight for the Alliance. We fight for ours and your freedom.

There are those by whom Ukraine exists, fights, wins. There are those who protect NATO, there are those who protect all of us - Ukrainian soldiers, armed forces.

“We owed to the present. Those who were murdered in Irpen, Bucha and Mariupol.

Debt can be paid in one way - to become a member of NATO.

We owed stories - to those who fought for Ukraine to be independent, fought in enslaved Europe under Soviet occupation. This will be due to the expansion and expansion of world democracy.

The united, democratic Europe will never be free without free Ukraine, continuing Ukraine, ”Arseniy Yatsenyuk summarized.

_ ** Background: ** Kyiv Security Forum was founded by the Arseniyanyuk Foundation "Open Ukraine" in 2007. KBF is the main platform of Ukraine for the formation of problems of war and peace, national and world security._

Millie and US Defense Minister Assist agencies of more than 50-Typads from all over the world in online format in Pentagon, Washington, District of Columbia, May 25, 2023, during which they discussed the continuous war of Russia in Ukraine in Ukraine further close coordination to provide the Ukrainian people with the means necessary to protect their sovereign territory.

"Hello to everyone. Thank you that we have joined us virtually from all time zones.

Since Ukraine is moving in the fight against Russian invaders, members of this contact group are the only ones. After the meeting of this group last month, the United States allocated an additional $ 1.8 billion to Ukrainian Security Aid.

This includes a recent package of $ 375 million with such Himars, anti -tank systems and laser missiles. We also provide key combat tools, such as transportation of heavy equipment Table bridge systems.

And in our last package of security assistance to Ukraine, the combination of America has financed additional anti -air defense systems of the camp. This package also includes equipment that will combine outdated Ukraine's prototype defense systems with the launching installations of the air defense, missiles and radars of members of this contact group.

We also provide more than 155 mm artillery shells, as well as increase training, maintenance and maintenance. We are concentrating a contribution that makes real changes in real time.

However, the United States is also dedicated to the long -term support of Ukraine. The Ukrainian ones that have come together today as well. We cooperate with all of you to give the defenders and defenders of Ukraine what they need when they need.

Several members of the contact group have recently made important ads.Denmark also announced a significant new package. It includes remedies for protruding defense and combat tools such as mine machines, mobile field bridges and evacuation machines.

France has also identified more light tanks and armored vehicles.

All these donations meet Ukraine's primary requirements and reflect the determination of this contact group.

Together, members of the contact group provided the Ukrainian soldiers with the necessary preparation. We have prepared motorized and mechanized crews, continuing to carry out collective preparation of Ukrainian combat units.

Earlier this month, 31 M1 Abrams tank from the United States arrived in Unime.

Last week, US President Joseph Biden announced that the United States would support joint efforts with our allies and partners to prepare Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation aircraft, including F-16. We hope that this training will begin in the coming weeks. This will further strengthen and improve the capabilities of the Ukrainian air forces in the long run. And this will supplement our co -resistant and medium -term safety agreements.

These new joint efforts send a powerful message about our unity and ovary devotion of Ukraine's self -defense. And this again testifies to the main determination to ensure that sovereign and safe Ukraine Moglast hold any future aggression and defend itself against future attacks.

You can see this dedication in our work on the most important potential that is now given by the contact group: terrestrial air defense systems. These are critically important systems protect the Ukrainian sky and civilian infrastructure from the attack of Russia. And we continue to deliver the needed trips.

In total, the contact group has allocated almost $ 65 billion for a security assistance. Now Putin hoped that our determination would disappear. And he staged that our unity would crack. Instead, we remain uniform as Iranian. And it can see the whole world. Now everyone here knows what Ukrainians reached. Russia has resumed its shocking and shameful flurry of racketees, which threaten innocent Ukrainian civilians, including hypersonic missiles aimed at Kiev.Russia was unable to dominate the Ukrainian airspace. And that is why the air defense will be again at the center of our dysfunctions. As always, our good friend Alexei Reznikov and his team join us. Alexei, thank you that we have taken time to inform us about Ukraine's priority needs for future struggle.

Then the commander of the European Command of the US Armed Forces and the security group of Ukraine will inform us about Ukraine's closest requirements. And we will solve the ways of further acceleration of industrial production of critical systems. We will have to dig deeper and we will have to continue to find creative ways to increase our industrial potential.

The rates are high. But the reason is fair. And our will is strong. We continue to build a sovereign right of Ukraine to live in freedom. We continue to intensify the open world of rules and rights. And we will defend the free sustive Ukraine as much as it will be needed, "said Lloyd Austin.

It was today that she introduced the appropriate [resolution](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-05-25/debates/6EC6E8AD-56E4-44BF-A0DC-1E077B9ED2E9/UkrainianHolodomor)In the lower house of the UK Parliament-the House of Commons, which unanimously decided to recognize the famine of 1932-1933 with the genocide of the Ukrainian Narode.

Before the debate, Polym Letham congratulated the ambassador of Ukraine to Vadim Prystayk in the parliament of Ukraine and emphasized that the famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s was artificial, caused by the forced selection of harvesting from Ukrainian peasants.

- 90 years ago, in the spring of 1933, millions of Ukrainians died of famine. However, there was no natural famine in Ukraine. The grain was plenty of grain, but all this was laid with incredibly high bread tariffs of Moscow. At that time, Moskva exported millions of tons of grain to the west until the Ukrainians were dying of the Putstalin violent famine. The word "famine" means death by hunger, and this is exactly what the USSR has done in Ukraine. I will come to the horrific details of famine, but when discussing genocide, it is also important to understand the context and motivation of the USSR in Moscow, - the parliamentarian said.

It also compared those events with the present, when Russia has stolen Ukrainian in temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories.** Reference **: As of 2023, the Holodomor has officially recognized the genocide -Ukrainian people over 20 countries of the world. In particular, on March 10, 2023, Belgium recognized the Holodomor of 1932-1933 by the genocide of the Ukrainian people. The Parliament of Iceland recognized the Holodomor on March 23, as the genocide of the Ukrainian people. On May 23, Slovenia Parliament supported the recognition of the 1932-1933 famine by the genocide of the Ukrainian Narode.

As Ukrinform reports its own correspondent, the General Secretariatric People's Party said this(ÖVP)Christian Strtoker during a press conference in Vienna.

"The Austrian Party of Freedom has become a Kremlin's propaganda instrument in the country and also in Europe. Therefore, it occupies a special place in the campaign [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)on destabilization of the situation in Europe. The fact that FPö has spread 280 presents that required the termination of sanctions(sanctioning against Russia - ed.), says everything you need to know about Kikle and Putin's relationship. Since the beginning of this invading war, FPö has introduced 8 projections of resolutions that concerned the termination of sanctions - a topic that FPö made for the target, "he said.

The Secretary General of which Federal Chancellor Carl Nevammer is the chairman, indicated that the Kremlin's liberty with the Kremlin is obvious.

"The proximity of the Austrian Party of Freedom to Russia is obvious. And this is part of the political party of freedom. Broken electron letters of the top Russian propagandist who were published A clearly planned Russian system, "said the tenter to the appropriate [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3665066-predstavniki-avstrijskoi-partii-svobodi-pracuvali-v-interesah-kremla-zmi.html).

According to him, it is also remarkable that FPö has previously "entered into a Friendship agreement with Putin's Dictatorship Party" One Russia " -" and it also emphasizes the political attitude of the party and Kikl to this topic. "

Against this background, the trickle pointed out that the Freedom Party tries to position as a defender of Austrian neutrality, which is actually a "paradox". "The party is not neutral, but on the side of Russia, which is leading the invasion of Europe," he said.

According to the politician, not only in Ukraine, but in many European countries they consider the Austrian party freedom as one that occupies the side of Russia.** Read also: ** [** Austria **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3713329-rosia-se-bagato-rokiv-zalisatimetsa-zagrozou-glava-mzs-avstrii.html)In addition, the rock called the head of the Party of Freedom to provide written evidence, which was signed in 2016 by the Agreement on Cooperation with Putin's "Uniform Russian" no longer operates. According to him, earlier the media reported that this agreement is continued, if it is not canceled within the set time frames, a butt must be a document on cancellation of the agreement.

"It is about the Austrian Parliamentary Party - a party of freedom - which has a friend about friendship with the Party of the Regime, which began in Europe the bloodiest war of the Second World War, attacked by a free state of Ukraine. .

In addition, the Secretary General of the Austrian People's Party wondered if there were any other secret additional agreements that FPö was keeping secret other than this undeningction.

The tent also urged the answer to the question of who funded the FPö policy trips to Russia and the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia first and foremost Crimea.

It is known that the far -right Austrian Freedom Party is the only one of the Austrian Parliamentary parties to abolish EU sanctions against Russia and to suppress the European Union of military support of Ukraine, as well as a criticism of different efforts to support the Federal Government of Ukraine, including in the issue of change. FPö also blocked the speech of President of Ukraine Volodymyrazellensky in the National Council of Austria, motivating that such a protruding is a violation of Austria's neutrality.

“We had a fairly moscowentral look. Similarly in academic circles. Japrofesor of Stanford University and I will tell you that we do not have the Department of Ukrainian. It's a shame, it's very wrong. And if someone has millions who can put in a good business, contact me, we have to think about it, ”he said.

Dobryanski stressed that victory is determined not only to win the war, but also to lose peace.“Therefore, after a military victory is won, there must be a trainee in matters of stabilization and reconstruction of the country. It is already a lot of effort to mobilize and financial resources, the private sector, and investors. But it is also about the issue of restoring justice, responsibility of criminals, the inevitability of punishment and the importance of Russian assets for compensation to Ukraine, ”the diplomat said.

"The question now is how to start this process and what are the options", _-_ say a diplomat.

According to him, one of the options is the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution: "This document must be produced with the Government of Ukraine and the International Tribunal."

Taylor reminded that Ukraine managed to collect support 141 and even 143 states-member states of the General Assembly: "Extraordinary efforts will be needed, but it can be done."

The diplomat also noted that [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ssa)The proposal was one mechanism for the beginning of the trial.

"The second option is smaller groups of countries, such as European countries that could create an international tribunal. The United States offered a hybrid version that was worried about Ukrainians and others. But it is based on the idea of internationalization of a national court. That is, it could be a Ukrainian court for international support," He said.

The third option Taylor called the idea of considering Putin's claim in one of third countries, such as European, in the jurisdiction of Jeslochin to commit the act of aggression.

Separately, the diplomat also spoke about the prospects of the NATO summit, which will soon be in Vilnius: "Dana Ukraine in 2008 the promise could come true ... Last week, Minister Reznikov asked our small group group experts about NATO open -door. He said: We don't see ". In Vilnius we have to see them. I think so."

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-26T16-57-03-03-00/630_360_1685108846-271.jpg)On May 27-28, the Ivano-Frankivsk Drama Theater will take place by the premiere of Dzhada with Adam Mickiewicz.

The CEO - artistic director - artistic director of the Ivanafranko National Academic Drama Theater, Rostislav Derzipilsky, told about it at the press conference, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“We are launching a new and serious page in the historical theater tomorrow. For the first time in the history of the Ukrainian theater will be presented one of the most significant for Polish literature and culture of the work of Adamickevich's "Dzaja", - said Derzhipilsky.

According to him, negotiations on the participation of European directors in the work of theater were even before the Great War. However, after February 24, the actors of the Frankish Theater did not understand whether anyone could come to them at all for serious work.

“When Maya Klechevskaya told Mickiewicz for the Dzaads, I realized that it was a wonderful man to get acquainted with the literature and dramaturgy of our neighbors. I am grateful that Maya responded. I believe that this work is the highlight of our repertoire, ”David David.

He noted that theater, cinema, music and literature remain a now -laid loophole for the "Russian measure", which this "measure" tries to crawl the skills of Europeans.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-26T16-57-03-03-00/1685109135-286.jpg)_Foto from pravda.if.ua_

In turn, Klechevskaya confesses that together with the actors of the Frankish theater, they tried to send a clear message to those Europeans who are moving in the "Charoshi Ruski".

"I want to tell them that every European today has to ask themselves:" How can we still help Ukraine? " Because Ukraine is struggling today for free Idomocratic Europe. What is the price of a life or blood on the front today? There is no such value. Europe should be grateful today that Ukraine has taken over to miss Putin Russia "Stop", - said the Polish director.

According to her, empathy to Ukraine is obvious today, because they see that they could also find themselves in such a situation.

"Therefore, we speak Russian culture" No!" The only voice, ” - said Vonialaklechevskaya.

The Polish creators of the Dzaad performances admit that they did not desire to help them in cooperation with Ukrainians, but accepted it as their duty. After all, the poem of the "Dzdy" is anti -Russian and written when Russia exported the sight of Ukrainian and Polish artists. The performance, notes, also came out to antitusian with modern senses.“This performance is an effort to show to the Western Europeans, who are the" Charosha ", to urge Europe not to become lawyers of" Charus Russian "because they are nowhere to be. If this performance is able to serve as one person who affects the Western and world culture, is made on a sanction list, then it will be a success for me, ” - admits the assistant of the director of the performance and head of the head role Roman Lutsk.

As the agency reported, earlier the Frankish Drama Theater canceled all the exhibition by the works of Russian writers.

"Dzadi" is the poetic drama of the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, one of the greatest works of both Polish and European Romanticism. Mickiewicz devoted to the poem, who fought for the freedom of Poland during the uprising of the 1830s, and specially those whose Russian king expelled to Siberia. In 1901 in Krakow [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-teatr)"My" showed the performance of Stanislav Vispiansky. After the capture of Poland, the Communists did not support the play "Dzadi". In 2022, the drama "Dzaadi" was published in Ukrainian translated by Viktor Humeniuk.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-26T18-23-41-03-00/630_360_1685114497-851.jpg)After three in a row canceled through the quarantine and the war of the annual comedy festivals "Golden Applause of Bukovina", which is traditionally held at the Chernivtsi Theater of Olga Kobylyanska, this year they plan to restore this event.

The director of the theater Ivan Butnyak told about this correspondent of Ukrinform.

"This year we plan to restore the" Golden Applause of Bukovina "in October. Perhaps the usual format of the comedy festival in war will not be completely right. Because we understand that when we are distracted by comedy, we forget for an hour or two-three all the same nearby. But we are moved not to hide from what provokes war to us. Conversely, that this festival has a mission. In this way we will organize an additional platform and support teams from those cities that now suffer from hostilities. Director [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-teatr).

Зокрема він зазначив, що попередньо планують запросити театральні колективи ізХаркова, Херсона та Одеси. Можливо, залучать і представників з іншихприфронтових міст. Через воєнний стан наразі важко робити далекоглядні плани.

"Зараз ми спілкуємося з колегами зі Сходу, ми розуміємо, наскільки їмвиявилося важче діяти останні півтора року, порівняно з Чернівцями, які втилу, у нас відносно безпечно. Ми зустрічаємо глядача, ми розвиваєморепертуар, ми відкриваємо нові майданчики, а вони в цей час не мають половинуколективу, які виїхали за кордон, хтось на фронті. Вони виставу не можуть нізробити, ні зіграти повноцінно через близькість фронту. І ми провокуємо цюзустріч нашого глядача із ними. А якщо приїде колектив з Харкова, а вЧернівцях живуть харків'яни, які зустрінуть його тут, ми спілкувалися зтакими. І це буде дуже вдало. Хочеться, щоб ми досягнули цієї місії, якаоб'єднає Україну цим фестивалем", - зазначив Бутняк.

Також він зауважив, що в цьому є якась цікавинка, коли до Чернівців зі сходуУкраїни приїде театр і буде жартувати через комедію. Це не обов'язково будесміх крізь сльози, але це буде обов'язково з присмаком, додав Бутняк.

He also noted that for the comedy festival, they plan to build two sites at once - the main stage of the theater and a recently opened Malusena in another room near the theater.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-26T18-38-42-03-00/630_360_1567593737-725.jpg)One of the pans, which will allow to start the process in the international tribunal to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to be responsible for aggressive Ukraine, may be the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution.

Such an opinion during [](http://ksf.openukraine.org/ua/news/2682-putina-mozhna-bude-prityagnuti-do-vidpovidalynosti-zavdyaki-rishennyu-genasambleji-oonvilyjam-tejlor)Vice president of the Peace Institute said(USA), US Ambassador to Ukraine in 2006-09, Ukrinform reports.

"The question now is how to start this process and what are the options", _-_ say a diplomat.

According to him, one of the options is the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution: "This document must be produced with the Government of Ukraine and the International Tribunal."

Taylor reminded that Ukraine managed to collect support 141 and even 143 states-member states of the General Assembly: "Extraordinary efforts will be needed, but it can be done."

The diplomat also noted that [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ssa)The proposal was one mechanism for the beginning of the trial.

"The second option is smaller groups of countries, such as European countries that could create an international tribunal. The United States offered a hybrid version that was worried about Ukrainians and others. But it is based on the idea of internationalization of a national court. That is, it could be a Ukrainian court for international support," He said.

The third option Taylor called the idea of considering Putin's claim in one of third countries, such as European, in the jurisdiction of Jeslochin to commit the act of aggression.

Separately, the diplomat also spoke about the prospects of the NATO summit, which will soon be in Vilnius: "Dana Ukraine in 2008 the promise could come true ... Last week, Minister Reznikov asked our small group group experts about NATO open -door. He said: We don't see ". In Vilnius we have to see them. I think so."

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-05-26T19-43-00-03-00/630_360_1678784649-408.jpeg)Presidentrf Vladimir Putin, thanks to propaganda, was able to build authoritarianism in Russia.

This opinion was expressed by the Ambassador from the special instructions of the US State Department in 1997-2001, Professor of Columbia University Stephen Sestanovich during [](https://ksf.openukraine.org/ua/news/2687-putinsyka-vlada-pobudovana-na-brehniprofesor-kolumbiisykogo-universitetu), reports Ukrinform.

“The war became possible because [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin)He built a system of power in which one person can make decisions that no one else can challenge or oppose it, ”the professor said, adding that propaganda played a key role in this process.

In this context, Sestanovich emphasized the need to expand the understanding of the information war, "because for 30 years we have seen anything as extremal as this combination of military capacity, aggression and propaganda."

“The West did not try to refute Russian fakes. But inside Russia it is a cestioned ... These stories were so funny and inadvertent that we have even become ill that someone could behave on them, ”the professor said, stressed that this position is unacceptable for victory in the information war.

In his turn, Professor Texas University in Arlington Brian Welcome was that Ukrainians have been debunking the myths today that Putin has spread in the last anniversary.

“In recent decades, Putin has been telling another story: the world is more dangerous, the patriarchal dictatorial regime that Ukraine does not exist. He tells the story that the sovereignty of small states depends on the greatness of great ones. That Russia, the US, China have subjectivity, and small countries do not have. What do Ukrainians do? They now refute these myths. They won them, ”he said.

“In my country, I saw the latest public opinion surveys: only 52% believe that it is important to live in democracy. For my generation, this percentage was 90. And now Ukraine shows us that democracy is worth fighting for it, ”he said.

The professor stressed that history shows that Ukraine has always been a European country, separate from Russia. "We were very underestimated by Ukraine," he added.

As Ukrinform reports its own correspondent, the General Secretariatric People's Party said this(ÖVP)Christian Strtoker during a press conference in Vienna.

"The Austrian Party of Freedom has become a Kremlin's propaganda instrument in the country and also in Europe. Therefore, it occupies a special place in the campaign [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)on destabilization of the situation in Europe. The fact that FPö has spread 280 presents that required the termination of sanctions(sanctioning against Russia - ed.), says everything you need to know about Kikle and Putin's relationship. Since the beginning of this invading war, FPö has introduced 8 projections of resolutions that concerned the termination of sanctions - a topic that FPö made for the target, "he said.

The Secretary General of which Federal Chancellor Carl Nevammer is the chairman, indicated that the Kremlin's liberty with the Kremlin is obvious.

"The proximity of the Austrian Party of Freedom to Russia is obvious. And this is part of the political party of freedom. Broken electron letters of the top Russian propagandist who were published A clearly planned Russian system, "said the tenter to the appropriate [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3665066-predstavniki-avstrijskoi-partii-svobodi-pracuvali-v-interesah-kremla-zmi.html).

According to him, it is also remarkable that FPö has previously "entered into a Friendship agreement with Putin's Dictatorship Party" One Russia " -" and it also emphasizes the political attitude of the party and Kikl to this topic. "

Against this background, the trickle pointed out that the Freedom Party tries to position as a defender of Austrian neutrality, which is actually a "paradox". "The party is not neutral, but on the side of Russia, which is leading the invasion of Europe," he said.

According to the politician, not only in Ukraine, but in many European countries they consider the Austrian party freedom as one that occupies the side of Russia.** Read also: ** [** Austria **](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3713329-rosia-se-bagato-rokiv-zalisatimetsa-zagrozou-glava-mzs-avstrii.html)In addition, the rock called the head of the Party of Freedom to provide written evidence, which was signed in 2016 by the Agreement on Cooperation with Putin's "Uniform Russian" no longer operates. According to him, earlier the media reported that this agreement is continued, if it is not canceled within the set time frames, a butt must be a document on cancellation of the agreement.

"It is about the Austrian Parliamentary Party - a party of freedom - which has a friend about friendship with the Party of the Regime, which began in Europe the bloodiest war of the Second World War, attacked by a free state of Ukraine. .

In addition, the Secretary General of the Austrian People's Party wondered if there were any other secret additional agreements that FPö was keeping secret other than this undeningction.

The tent also urged the answer to the question of who funded the FPö policy trips to Russia and the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia first and foremost Crimea.

It is known that the far -right Austrian Freedom Party is the only one of the Austrian Parliamentary parties to abolish EU sanctions against Russia and to suppress the European Union of military support of Ukraine, as well as a criticism of different efforts to support the Federal Government of Ukraine, including in the issue of change. FPö also blocked the speech of President of Ukraine Volodymyrazellensky in the National Council of Austria, motivating that such a protruding is a violation of Austria's neutrality.

Francis Fukuyama noted that any peace agreements could not be effective for Ukraine without joining NATO, as time will allow Russia to re-arry and continue the war.

- Under the current conditions, peace talks and temporary ceasefire can be damaged by Ukraine. After all, it can leave Russia control over the Donbass, Crimea of the southern coast of Ukraine. And here is an even deeper problem. While Vladimir Putin when the power, any "peace agreements" will simply allow Russia to re-arry their own to later restore the war. Any long settlement has a stronger security guarantees for Ukraine,-Francisfukuyama stressed.

He believes that the renewal of war with Russia in the future can only a member of Ukraine in NATO and the guarantees provided for in Article 5.

- NATO membership will become real if, thanks to the counter -offensive, Ukraine is Retrachrson and Zaporizhzhya regions, - said Professor of the Stanford University. - The fear of slow blocking of Crimea can encourage Putinovation of attacks on Ukraine, unlock Ukrainian ports on a long -term basis to cause terrorist missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Francis Fukuyama stressed that the effectiveness of any arrangements with Russia will depend on Ukraine's membership in NATO.

- While we are waiting for the Ukrainian counter -offensive to begin, we need to think about what this war can end. As I said, peaceful and ceasefires in the current circumstances will be a very bad idea for Ukraine. Every member of NATO, who has doubts about this, must say how much a peace agreement is possible in the following years, not simply a short -term suppression of fire and the opportunity for Russia to overthrow themselves, to rebuild the Higherly to restore the war, - said Frances Fukuyama.

During the event, they discussed the current security situation in the region and the world, exchanged views on trends in the world, and outlined the directions of deepening of bilateral cooperation.

About it [reports](https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/ua/Diialnist/6364.html)National Security and Defense of Ukraine.

The NSDC Secretary of Ukraine expressed gratitude to the American side for the support of our state on her way to win in the aggressive war, solved by the Russian Federation.

According to Alexei Danilov, at the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russian world analytical centers "thought we would not stand", but Ukraine "proved the opposite".

"Few people in the world are forecasting for 30-40 years in advance, and if it is sorted, partly with mistakes and not taking into account history," he said.

According to the NSDC Secretary of Ukraine, not only the victory of Ukraine is important, but also the "victory in peace", and the support of partners in this is extremely necessary.

"We will fight as much as we need, because we are responsible for the displacement of our country, and now we have a chance to build a new country," Danilov added.

"The fragmentation of the Russian Federation is a matter of time, and it is necessary to be prepared," said Alexei Danilov. "These processes - like a snowy coma, cannot be stopped."

The issue of counteracting Russian misinformation was discussed separately. According to Danilova, "Russian -speaking TV channels around the world are not the illumination of the word", because "the vast majority of them are the Russian -specific service." In order to combat misinformation of the Russian Federation, it is necessary to coordinate between partners, he emphasized, noting in this context the relevance of working with the Center for Combating Misinformation in the NSDC of Ukraine.

It is they who convey goals and we work specifically on them, but instead katsaps are delightful to realize shelling "squares". In my opinion, they have behind us a minimum of five generations.

But the mortar calculation only expected when the moment would come and there would be a specific target.

After receiving the team together with the servicemen, we leave the dominance, which in a few minutes will replenish the rows of "good Russians".

I will put them in a mortar, I will make a specific guidance to accurately hit the given, and we will expect a team "Fire", - says the senior gunner "Artist".

The team comes, and the calculation begins to make shots 120 mm. Having worked for the specified purposes, the defenders quickly roll up to the shelter.

- We are not far from the enemy, so we understand well that acting should actually and quickly. My task, like service numbers, staff mines of tadoaging the gunner. The average range we launch our "Kral" is three kilometers, the maximum was five, - supplemented Vladimir.

Personally, I am motivated by what I should look at the domestic and I understand that there is my house, which rushists are trying to destroy. It works as an additional motivation not to give up and reflect our land of a pre -sovereign shred. Mentally, I imagine how every family turns to their native villages and homes, they have no fear anymore and the common can continue their free life in Ukraine. It drives each defense counsel here, ”the Shchok added.

The Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Sweden Paul Jonson during a briefing in Kiev reported that Sweden was working on the request of Ukraine to evaluate the capabilities of GriPen.

- It is important to say that this process has already been started and the testing occurs. It applies to all systems that are mounted on the fighter. This can be carried out by using imitation equipment, and I believe that such an algorithm can be applied to fighters in the future [F-16](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/05/24/pershyj-zhe-ukrayinskyj-f-16-stane-odnym-iz-najsylnishyh-sygnaliv-vid-svitu-shho-rosiya-lyshe-vtrachatyme-prezydent/)for their testing. Despite the fact that Russia, which is also our neighbor, has weakened in its land component, its air -laid was not particularly injured. It will be quite problematic for us to transfer GriPen own fighters, but we do not exclude this issue in the future, - said Paul Jonson.

He focused on the importance of initiative [Poland](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/05/polshha-peredala-ukrayini-8-vynyshhuvachiv-mig-29-ta-gotova-nadaty-shhe-6/)and [Slovakia](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/17/slovachchyna-zavershyla-peredachu-ukrayini-13-vynyshhuvachiv-mig-29/)Concerning the transfer of the aircraft-29 to Ukraine and expressed his hope for the creation of the CoalitionF-16 coalition in support of our country.

- Sweden is now co -challenges in the European Union and the support of Ukraine is one of the key priorities. I recently returned from the meeting of the Ministers of Defense of the EU Member States, which took place in Brussels, and I am glad to inform you that we are peaceful in the direction of these obligations to purchase 1 million artillery ammunition to meet the needs of Ukraine. We continue to support Ukraine in any possible way.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T69-00-00-04-00/photo_2023-05-26_12-12-52.jpg)Massive and combined hostile blows of rockets of different types and shock UAVs of train and infrastructure objects are part of the terrorist plan of the Russian Federation, which is thus to scare the population and identify the location of elements of Ukrainian air defense system, which is effectively anti -diabetes. This was reported on the national telephone of the Unified News by the Head of the Joint Coordination Press Center of Defense Forces of South Ukraine Captain 1 rank Natalia Humeniuk.

According to Natalia Humeniuk, during a massive hostile stroke using different types of missiles and Shakhaned UAVs, which took place at night and morning, he was aware of the attention of air defense and attacked from various strokes.

“In the southern direction, convinced of the efficiency of the Ukrainian air defense, the enemy sought new routes for barrowing shells. The enemy was conquered by the occupied Kherson region, then led by the de -industrial territory of the Kherson region, and already above the Nikolaev region two "chemals" were destroyed by the Air Force ", - Natalia Humeniuk said.

According to her, the enemy continues attacks with the help of aviation in front -line territories - the Right Bank suffers from the blows of managed airbags. Elevator, agricultural enterprises and agricultural equipment were damaged by the invaders.

“They try to hit, in particular with ballistic missiles, they will be more likely to continue this tactic. In order to really convince - where and what capacity, in which regions are located, how a prototypal defense works. That is why we always emphasize that they do not announce the work of the air defense, do not show how it works. Because it is our protection and realized - it is much more important than bright videos or photos. The worm tries to attack various types of weapons in order for those systems that work today, they can not work quite effectively in high -cost efficiency and have been identified. They try to use wave attacks, just to see where the defense worked - Abipotim hit there, ”Natalia Humeniuk said.

According to her, Ukrainian defenders methodically forces the enemy to retreat his defensive borders in the south. Therefore, their main bases are located as far away from the front line.According to her, massive shelling, which was suffered by peaceful Ukrainian cities by the Russian aggressor is a clear proof of the terrorist essence of the enemy.

“The intention of using ballistics is quite obvious and understandable - to see where the air defense system will work, to scare the population, to demonstrate the capacity of the weapons, the confusion of the authorities and people. In principle, this is all the characteristics of the terrorism - the enemy reinders on it. They are looking for what we love and try to destroy in us the belief that we will defeat and be moose, ”Natalia Humeniuk emphasized.

For safety reasons, it is functioning from the settlements, and there are advantages, because the separate location allows you to paint freely from different types of arming, to train military equipment drivers and to carry out other maneuvers in the training of units and their combat coordination.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T72-00-00-04-00/1-116.jpg)In conditions as close as possible to combat, DFTG instructors and several units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are currently preparing for the implementation of the curriculum at the same time from several military disciplines.

First, instructing, proving the practical plan, checking the weapons of and supplying individual means of protection. The younger commanders report to the senior on the field of working properly communications and the readiness of the tasks. Fire training exercises are performed first from the place: slim positions and distances, later in motion. Any action takes place in a command of the instructor: “Prepare. Attach the store. The shot of the shooting finished ... The team "Disconnect the store!". After that, everyone shoots their results and mistakes to work on.

According to the correspondent Armyinform, a fire training instructor who has considerable experience of military service in the units of the Special Forces forces behind his shoulders, with the call sign "Master", classes in this military discipline - some of the most beloved, and the fighters attend training with great pleasure.

Battle groups are usually focused on a series of five-seven training once a week. They are available almost all types of infantry weapons.

- Every day, our shooters become more accurate, which means that the number of studied reserve of Ukrainian defenders is increasing systematically, - says "Master".

_

The Ternovo Pole Training Center was created at the beginning of a large -scale maintenance of Russia in Ukraine. The decision on its formation was made in the first month of open aggression of the enemy and was conditioned by the entry into the battalion "Lutsk" of volunteers without military experience. Then no one knew how long the border of Volyn had to prepare defenders. There was a fairly high probability of the enemy on the part of Belarus. That is why officers with combat experiences who were composed of the battalion, got up to actively teach their volunteers.

The explosion is heard, and the pose is not possible: everyone falls with the cry of "grenade" with their feet to the explosion:

- The right leg is injured!

- You can impose a turnstile?

- Can!Grenade!

- Alive!?

- Alive!

- Commander, fighter 2-0 injured. Allow evacuation?

- Forward!.. ..

- This group is already relatively experienced, because it is the fourth of their lessons, - says the instructor on the pseudo "Doc", who has gained invaluable experience outside Ukraine. - The unit practically perfectly worked out the scenario of actions in the Red Zone, using all the knowledge gained from pre -training. They know the human anatomy, demonstrate the ability to use the individual first aid kits, have skills and competencies not only with the use of the Turquet, but also the examination of the victim according to the March algorithm, in particular it concerns the planning and evacuation. During the removal of a clear and cohesion of the military team, which acts as one.

The combat physician also stressed that one of the most important aspect training was and would be the ability to provide home assistance to himself. Having passed our training in conditions that are close to the combat, a realistic picture of the combat theater is reproduced, participants become more ready for any situations. All this plays an important role in the formation of vital skills of the Ukrainian military.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T81-00-00-04-00/foto-01.jpg)On the evening of May 24, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that at about 5:30 armed Ukraine "made a futile attempt to attack three unmanned speed boats" the ship "Ivan Hurs". According to Russia's military collection, the intelligence vessel was fulfilled by the security of the functioning of gas pipelines "in the exclusive economic zonituretsky Republic" of 140 km northeast of the Bosphorus Strait. Evenly, it was stated that all boats were "destroyed by fire from the regular weapons of the Russian ship", which allegedly confirmed a video with the defeat of one delay.

But in a day, probably enjoying the unreasonable triumph of the enemy, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine [demonstrated](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1661789365582921744)Video "Romantic Meeting" of our surface drone with a reconnaissance ship.

“When the Russian reconnaissance ship" Ivan Hurs "met the Ukrainian non -infantry. Indeed, the perfect couple!”, - accompanied by Mow such signature.

> WHEN The Russian Reconnaissance Ship "Ivan Khurs" Met A Ukrainian Drone. > Indeed, a perfect match!> [Pic.twitter.com/mw3cld0vhh](https://t.co/mW3clD0vHh)>> — Defense of Ukraine(@DefenceU)[May 25,> 2023](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1661789365582921744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)The Ukrainian video refutes the official version of the enemy that Ivan Hurs was not abused, because the frames are broken only after the drone approached the left feed. Judging by the powerful explosion of the lined boat, the other, not destroyed, the Moods to cause a lot of harm to the reconnaissance vessel.

At our request for the combat capabilities of Ivan Hursa and its importance for the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, the Armyinform readers were told by the Head of the Department and Navy of the National Defense University of Ukraine named after Ivanachernyakhovsky captain Stepan Yakimak.

- This ship was not intended for the Black Sea Fleet, but for the Pvenokoean, - said Stepan Yakimak. - But in 2017, the Russian reconnaissance ship "Liman" was in black when he stood on an anchor of the Bubbosphorus, and a ship with sheep came in. Therefore, the decision to proceed Ivan Hurs to the Black Sea Fleet was made.- From the beginning of the large -scale invasion of Ivan Hurs, the entrance has been actively involved, - says Stepan Yakimak. - was involved in reconnaissance in various blacks of the Black Sea, performing a wide range of intelligence tasks. In particular, we observed that it periodically went into the area between the Ostrovomia and the Odessa gas field.

Ivan Hurs reconnaissance ship can be in an autonomous supply for more than a month, so it has for a long time to identify our strengths at sea and the scienceshore, listened to the Navy radar stations, as well as our retortal defense, etc.

- This is a traditional task for reconnaissance ships, - says Stepanayak. - listening to radio channels, detection of active stations, and such intelligence always operates in the complex: there are certain coastal systems and centers, such -ship elements, as well as space, air. Ivan Hursa's ships are important for the intelligence information to become reliable. Their role is important because they unfold directly in the right areas, which can not be made by coastal or air.

According to the Head of the Department of the Navy of the National University of Defense of Ukraine, Ivan Hurs reconnaissance operated in the northwestern part of the Black Sea, from the Danube Girle line to Cape Sarich in the Crimea-an area that the Russian Federation declared after the invasion. And this ship depended on 40-60 percent of the success of the goals in our forces in the fighting area.

- There are other Russian reconnaissance ships, but they are older, have a native motorcycle and less ability to intelligence, - says Stepan Yakimak. -Therefore, in the case of disruption of this key ship, the proponent loses these significant 40-60 percent of the accuracy of information that gives a complex intelligence system.

In addition to monitoring our forces, judging from the place of attack on the Bilyabosphorus ship, he could monitor the activity of Romania, Turkey and other countries in the Black Sea, as well as civilian navigation.

As for the attack on Ivan Hursa, according to Stepan Yakimak, it is not Moglas to serious resistance, because reconnaissance ships have lightwear and usually perform their tasks in safe areas. But avoiding the reach of our "Neptune", the Russians were miscalculated.

[!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T81-00-00-04-00/foto-02-150x150.jpg)](https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/foto-02.jpg)

_No image from above: 1)the frame of the explosion of our surface drone; 2)the personnel of the other drone to the Russian ship._

-By the way, I emphasize that Ivan Hurs is a legitimate goal for our forces, where Vinne is, because it is a ship of the Black Sea Fleet,-says a naval expert. - According to international law, we should only guarantee the safety of more vessels that can be near it during the attack.

Stepan Vladimirovich explains that the Russians try to cover themselves with the term "exclusive economic zone" of Turkey, but the stay in it does not protect the ship from the attack, because they are waters called the "open sea", that is, an actor outside the territorial seas of state Actions would really be illegal.

As for the damage that the Russian ship could theoretically suffer, judging by the scattered videos, Stepan Yakimak believes that they can be significant: the power of the explosion of the destroyed boat plus the impact of another drone is predicted by the vessel.

- They hit the forage part of the left side, - analyzes Stepan Vladimirovich. —The at a depth of 1.5-2 meters is one of the roweds of the screw. It is even a hotter for the Russians than the screw itself. The cavities of both screws are such special -trimming, which go to the machine compartment, and they are difficult to manufacture so that there is no vibration and so on. If you bend a little, it leads to the fact that this valor becomes generally unusable.

In addition, about the fact that could be seriously damaged by both valov drives(tagvins)They also say data of the international traffic information system of vessels, which shows the movement in real time. According to Stepan Yakimak, this global -system showed about 0.8 nodes after the attack.

- Roughly speaking, the eyelashes went at a speed of less than two kilometers per hour, receiving at least 12 knots - at the combat or even fuel -economic course, - says Stepan Vladimirovich. - So the damage is serious.

The expert notes that with the estimated mass of explosives of 50-70 kilograms, punching directly into board the ship can create a hole with a diameter of about a meter. If they have a struggle for the vastability of the vessel, then the crew could somehow seize the feed compartment and get to the area of repair base.

“The Ukrainians did a great job in what is happening here. Ukraine is doing marketing work, ”Larisa Galadz said.

Due to the fact that Ukrainians are not able to answer all these problems, it is necessary to strengthen the world support for Ukraine. This is especially true of the ames after the consequences of the war, where there is a local and national level.

“I am increasingly convinced that Ukraine will be reconstructed and restored by Ukraine. Because the scale of the problem cannot be covered by nationalstrategy. They go much beyond these limits. Now people at the local level see what they need, and they begin to formulate it in numbers, ”Galadza emphasized.

According to Larissa Galadzi, it is worth "recognizing the unprecedented level of response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.

“World support has proven the value of our alliances. We, in the west and north, should work better in the south and east, taking into account the peculiarities of what is giving in Ukraine, ”said Larisa Galadz.

We are talking about diplomatic and political work with countries that have a neutral position on the Russian-Ukrainian war.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T89-00-00-04-00/photo1685108373.jpg)Currently, the Ukrainian army is the best equipped and with the greatest combat experience in Europe. This was stated by the US permanent representative at NATO in 2013–2017 General Douglas Furious during the 15th Annual Kyiv Security Forum.

He stressed that despite the fact that the collective agreement on the creation provides three key criteria for membership in the Alliance, NATO should provide Ukraine with a place "at the table" every time Ukraine would feel a threat.

-** First, ** The country that wants to become a member of NATO should be able to make a collective defense. Ukraine is definitely in line with this criterion today. Let us be honest, today Ukraine has the best equipped army of Vevropy. This is a fact. In addition, it has the greatest combat experience. That is, there are no questions about this criterion, - said the general.

*!

- It is necessary for Ukrainians to ask this question to their leadership, how much Ukraine meets these three basic values. This is the work that is being done, "Douglas fiercely emphasized.

** The third requirement ** for membership is the requirement of the consensus of NATO member states while voting. In the context of this, he recalled that Sweden is also unable to disburse the Alliance, because there are 31 votes.

- Even if we are not able to reach consensus in these 6 weeks(to the Summit of Ukraine on membership of Ukraine. - _ ed._), it is necessary to determine the assurance of safety - training on equipment, exchange of intelligence information, everything that will allow us to defend Ukraine today. This should be determined at a bilateral level, not 31 countries. In addition, NATO can offer Ukraine a unique yosual relations with the Alliance - for this it is possible to create something like the Council "Ukraine - NATO," he said.

The General noted that this council can give Ukraine the right to gather a membership of a novice Atlantic alliance at any time.

-This will give Ukraine a place at the table at any time, when Ukraine is to feel ash. And this will undoubtedly be the right place to discuss the problems of security with which Ukraine is dealing with today. Today, NATO Council exists only one country - not a member, it is a NATO - Russia Council. But I propose to replace it with NATO - Ukraine and plant Ukraine at the table. Yes, it is not a membership, but a step that should be taken, - the expert said._Opto Victor Dehtyar_

He just had a bet.

The question is obvious. Advanced, our protection and our active actions, providing our military with weapons and shells, equipment.

Air defense and protection against terror. During the day, I receive reports on the situation in the Dnieper elimination of the consequences of the next blow. This is a purely atrocity: Russian rocket, ballistics - against hospital and veterinary clinic. Absolutely sick creatures.

As of this moment, two people were killed as a result of the impact. My condolences to my loved ones!The analysis has not yet ended. More than 30 people are injured, two children.

We will do everything possible, everything is impossible to accelerate the supply of Ukraine's large quantity and quality of air defense systems - this is a literally daily issue for work with partners.

During this week, we also have considerable progress on modern aviation for Ukraine, which is a key component of our protection in the air. We are moving the defensemodation faster than we could predict six months ago.

An important report on the stake was made by General Syrsky - regarding the corresponding preferences in the Donbass. Our warriors do incredible things there, and everyone reflected the occupiers, each occupied by our own height - these are new and newarguments for the world that Ukraine can win. Thank you every warrior!Tavriya, Odessa, North, Kharkiv Protection - Attention to every direction.

The Minister of Defense reported to me about the results of the Ramstin's meeting - good.

He also held a meeting with internationalists on our NATO Movement - more conceptual. We have to use - and use it!- Every opportunity this year, in general this year, to fill our relations with the Alliance with real political content.

There was an important conversation with Senator Graham - one of the most influential idle US senators. We have discussed the situation in our defense today, our needs in the near future. I thank you for understanding Ukraine!

We are preparing several international appeals to increase the support of our country with the more freedom struggle - support both in the circle of our traditional allies of the partners and in the countries of the global south.And one more.

Today, Georgia celebrates Independence Day. I congratulate the whole people of Georgia Tabada to be with us and all other peoples of Europe in a free, peaceful and united European family.

Yet!Georgia is one long time and respectful historical forces, and I cannot overcome this force, I am sure of it. გაუმარჯოს თავისუფალ საქართველოს!

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-05-26T91-00-00-04-00/0m6a0207-1.jpg)This was stated by US Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter during the 15th Kyiv Security Forum.

The American diplomat spoke about the place of the Russian-Ukrainian war in an international scale. In his opinion, the war should be considered at three levels.

“First of all, the war continues at the individual level, that is, the struggle of freedom to the collective will of the state. So many different revolutions, such as an American revolution(XVIII Art. - _red._)But the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity was about it.

The second level is society. And this is about institutions.

The third level is the clash of two systems - democracy and autocracy. Cesystematmatic battle. The main thing in this is the victory of Ukraine. Outbuilding control is also important, ”Michael Carpenter said.

According to Michael Karpenter, Ukrainian victory in the war is a question of the world level, because it is already a matter of international freedom.

“Ukraine has to win because it is a matter for international freedom. And this depends on the success of international freedom. Therefore, further critical is further, economic, humanitarian support.

It is necessary to invest in Ukraine, to invest in international security, environmental security, ”Michael Carpenter said.

There should be no gray zones to create a new security system. And Ukraine's accession to NATO is an important part of this process.

“In gray zones(_We are countries that are not in alliance._ - _ ed._)There is no safe place. We had to understand this earlier. We actually unpredictable how everything will happen(Large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine on February 24, 2022._ - _ Ed.).

Сподіваюся, у Вільнюсі це вирішиться, що більше не буде сірих зон у Європі.

Треба думати масштабно, щоб не допустити того, що відбулося в Бучі, Ірпені,Гостомелі, в майбутньому.

Ідеологічне протистояння демократії та автократії — це серйозний виклик нашомуспособу життя. У нас є можливість створити нові правила. Нова європейськаархітектура безпеки буде залежати багато в чому від інституцій», — резюмувавМайкл Карпентер.

Yes it is!After all, the world will not forget how the Nazis destroyed people with mental disabilities. And the Dnieper, like all Ukrainians, will never forget the evil that was committed on our land by Russian.

There will never be a victory in Ukraine!Ever!They are still unclear that the people of Ukraine wants to breathe on full breasts on their land and but to be.

According to the Dnieper, who were near the current tragedy, despite the fact, they believe in our victory and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

- And thank you to our guard sky!- people say. - If it were not for them, imagine how many grief, destruction, murder of our children and parents, Russian inhumans have suffered. Those who carry out at the territory of our sovereign country will certainly be punished and damn forever. And we will withstand and we will build!

Tomorrow the Dnieper will bow his head to memory of the dead. The city announced a day.
