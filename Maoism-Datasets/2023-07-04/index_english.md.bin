- First of all, these are the actions of Marines. Never forget how in the first days, one of the Marines blew himself together with the bridge on the Crimean. It also struck the way one of the boys knocked down three -controvers in one day. The deed of the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Igor Bedzai, who himself sat down at the helicopter hello, will remain in the memory of the hero, although he could entrust this to the deed pilots. I can not but mention our heroic rockets who write a new history of naval battles with their works. After all, it is not every day to go to the Donovo Rocket cruiser. Thank you also to divers who work in the high conditions and at night, destroying mines. And in general, you can tell for hours the proteaism of my subordinates. And it is really difficult to separate someone. Every navy has something to be proud of, because our people are indeed invincible!- Alexei Zhpapa said in [interview](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/07/02/my-povynni-maty-takyj-flot-yakyj-bilshe-ne-dast-zagarbnyku-navit-planuvaty-napad-na-ukrayinu-oleksij-neyizhpapa/?utm_source=mainnews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=traficsource)for ia.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/1-2-1-scaled.jpg)The North Atlantic Alliance has undergone a certain evolution in the understanding of what is a defense, restraint, and how to respond to security challenges. The beginning of the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 from the occupation of Crimea and the beginning of hostilities, Nadonbass led to conceptual changes in NATO.

More about NATO changing its approaches to security, said a tribal interview for the ArmyInform CEO of Rasmussen Globalfabris Potier, who previously formed the Alliance Development Strategy. The first part of the NATO summit in Wales 2014 and whether 2 %of GDP costs are enough.

*!Saint-Kanen-Ivelin, Versel University of Versel University and Metropolitenlondon University. In 2007-2010 he was the founding director Carnegie Europe. In 2010-2016-the head of the NATO Secretary General Planning Office. Since 2016 - CEO of Rasmussen Global.__

** _-_ ** ** What do you think about NATO transformations during Russian large -scale coordination of Russia to Ukraine? How did the war change alliance? **

_-_ I think there were two speakers. First, when NATO for the first time in the latest history began to revise their concept of nuclear restraint. This was really a reversible moment. When I joined NATO in 2010, there was an analysis of defense and nuclear restraint, but very few people were ready to talk about nuclear restraint as such.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/2-2-1.jpg)NATO leaders at Chicago Summit 2012

In 2014, there was a moment when NATO had to rethink these terms to re -reinstall them. So, I think, in the conceptual, intellectual development, it was the discovery of the concept of nuclear restraint. NATO had to defile its position in the European territory against what it has argued as a greater threat to Russia.

And the second dynamics is that, apparently, a much minority was carried out, which were needed to restrain Putin. As we are unfortunately the field in 2022, eight years he made it again _(_ _ stopped on Ukraine. —The ed.)_.

And that means that in some way NATO's restraint and defense measures have been partially seized. Yes, the Alliance managed to protect its territory, but the plans of holding were failed, including sanctions that did not change the behavior of theuputin. Therefore, I think it was an important lesson in 2014._-_ If you look at [the strategic concept of 2010](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_68580.htm), it was a truly attempt to find a balance between three main tasks. Namely collective defense, foreign missions and new security threats. But very quickly, since 2014, the concept of 2010 was crossed out by the first Russian aggression against Ukraine.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/3-1-1.jpg)And I started editing a strategic concept. You know when a Word is viewed to see what can be changed, which is completely complete. And how NATO characterized relations with Russia, obviously, it was more strategic partnership.

I think that the balance between the above three main tasks was also impossible.

The main task was the collective defense of the Alliance. And then we began to combine other activities around the defense, including new threats.

** _-_ ** ** Why NATO Wales Summit in 2014 became historical? **

_-_ I think it was the first point when NATO returned to Europe both as a waoperative and philosophical sense. It was the first summit to which it was considering its main mission in Europe. The value of the latter was not the main among the priorities of the Alliance.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/4-3-scaled.jpg)And I remember the meeting in the North Atlantic Council _(NATO's main political organ. - Ed.)_, on which we discussed how to build a territorial defense and what weapons need to have. But then new gaps emerged strategic planning, such as mobility.

NATO had a new brilliant solution after Wales _ --__ a plan of readiness. The Equati argued that more than 40,000 NATO forces would be almost constantly being deployed on the eastern flank. But for a short time, they had to be deposited with additional alliance forces.

We have realized that there were no legal arrangements to quickly overwhelm NATO forces.

Part, if you want, rethink an alliance called "Readiness Action Plan", agreed at the Summit in Newport(Wales)In the United Kingdom, which became a truly molding summit. Because at that time, NATO allies discussed the teaching of foreign forces about Afghanistan. Instead, the Alliance did not speak prokelive defense and nuclear restraint in the European territory.

The summit in Wales was the first of a series of summits, where the topics of discussion are collective defense, nuclear restraint and Russia. And the trend persists._-_ Yes, it was a heavy battle. I prepared the initial Atlantic Declaration. The intervals were difficult, especially with Canada and Germany. The then Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, was a fiscal hawk, which was compounded for money for 2 % of GDP for defense. And then many other countries hid the borrowing of Canada and Germany, because it was convenient.

As a result, we received a text with a typical diplomatic language where there were many of the magnitude.

However, we can call it success. Why? Because for the first time, such a requirement was presented for approval to the heads of state.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/5-3-scaled.jpg)The main results of the NATO summit in Wales/ Army Infographic

And that was my initial idea when Anders Fog Rasmussen _(NATO Secretary General U2009-2014. - Ed.)_ announced her. In fact, 2 % of the cost of defending in the past, and even 3 % during the Cold War.

** _-_ ** ** What is the result of this obligation now? **

_-_ first, there are two people who have forced to increase NATO's costs for defense _ --_ Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. In a crazy way but trigger became(aggressive)Putin's actions against Ukraine. Therefore, many European countries have acknowledged that they need to increase defense and ability.

And then Donald Trump _(In 2016. - Ed.)_ was elected President of the United States. He began to distort the idea that the US obligation to NATO _-_ is the investment in defense. And it caused another shock in the Alliance.

NATO countries are still not achieving the goal, so now we can only talk about the seven units that have 2 %. I think there are ten countries that are close to this purpose or reach it by 2024.

When you look at the overall situation, you can give the argument a projection already 3 %. And I know that on the eve of the Vilnius Summit in NATO there were disclosures to have a target of 2.5 % as new 2 %.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T86-00-00-04-00/6-1-1.jpg)This is a discussion to have 2 % not as a maximum but a minimum. NATO has the opportunity to go beyond the boundaries of 2 %. But the Alliance countries do not yet have the necessary expenses. And this is evidence that Europeans have not yet set defense on the first plane of their priorities, knowing the world we live in.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/1-3-1.jpg)Today, the Hague has announced the creation of an International Center for Investigation for Crime Agression against Ukraine. In general, the issue of bringing the reference of Russian military criminals is among the main priorities of Ukraine and foreign partners. Therefore, it is important to understand the legal mechanisms of the process.

The correspondent of the Armyinform, while in Brussels as part of the EU's response in Ukraine, recorded an exclusive interview with the European Commissariatration Didier Rainerders about the Roman Statute and Ukraine and how it is possible to condemn Russian military criminals.

** - Why is the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine is crucial for investigating Russian military crimes? ** **

- First of all, it is very important for all democratic countries to participate in international institutions involved in the fight against international crime. International criminal court was created to organize investigations, prosecution and condemnation of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide crimes or aggression.

And this is very important for all participants in the process. This is the first reason for such a reclamation country as Ukraine, as a candidate country for entrance to the EU, very importantly participate.

I repeat all the time that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has come time to ratify the Roman Statute _(Ukraine has signed in 2000, but not yet ratified. - Avt.)_.

The second reason why it is important to do because if you ask to apply_(against Russia. - Ed.)_ International rules, you also need to eat with them in Ukraine. I know that military crimes in Ukraine have been committed by the Russians.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/2-3.jpg)The world map showing the status of the Roman Statute

I cited an example when they send the UN peacekeeping mission to another country and is shaking war. And then it is worth making sure that persons who committed war crimes, for example, will be punished against women and children.

Because if the country is involved in the international process, international jurisdiction, it is easier to come to court with more and more countries that we need to support Ukraine. In this way, a tribunal will be created on the crime of aggression.

Therefore, the ratification of the Roman Statute by Ukraine will, of course, help organize investigation, persecution and condemnation of Russians responsible for these crimes.- Starting from February 24, 2022, Euras _(The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Salvation. - Avt.)_ tried to create a duplicate mechanism based on existing tools. Eurosta plays the role of intermediary between prosecutors of different countries. So two things were done.

You know that because of Russian aggression in Ukraine it was difficult to obtain digital division. So, we changed the position in euro. Now Euras has created the Basudans to collect all evidence and exchange them between prosecutors of different EU Member States, the International Criminal Court in Ukraine-everywhere. This is the first step.

[As the International Criminal Court arrests Putin](https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/03/20/yak-mizhnarodnyj-kryminalnyj-sud-zaareshtuye-putina/)The next is the organization of skillful coordination of actions. So, we have a joint investigation, that is, a specific team with prosecutors of the EU Member States, Ukraine, the International Criminal Court. There is a good cooperation with our American colleagues for data exchange, investigation and judicial reversal of war crimes. A joint investigative group - the third part - will now be the International Center for Pursuing Crime Aggression against Ukraine.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/3-2.jpg)It is not only about war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, but also a crime of aggression. There is an opportunity to gather evidence and prepare the prosecution research group. Such a role is given to European.

In addition, Eurasa gives the ability to work together. We have meetings of prosecutors between participants from different countries of the world and, of course, from Europe.

Eurost plays a central role in the development of the process, as there is a collection of collection and organized coordination between prosecutors.

** - ** ** What is your position on the chances of bringing Russia to justice comprehensive violations of international law? **

- I am convinced that we have a lot of evidence that Russia has made multi -ordinations of international law to give the first and possibly two examples. So, the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity is obvious. And the violation of the state sovereignty of Ukraine is obvious.

That is why we try to work on a crime of aggression separately. But now the ICS will talk hard about specific violations of certain conventions. We try to give all the support to get more evidence of a violation.

My work is to provide all opportunities and tools to the prosecutors with judges to perform their work, investigate, pursue and judge military warriors.** - ** ** What is your position on investigating the crime of Russia's genocide anti -Ukraine? **

- We have a jurisdiction on all international crimes, including crime. There is an International Criminal Court.

It is clear that they do everything possible in the ISS for investigation.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/4-4.jpg)Of course, when you talk about genocide, it is more difficult to investigate in comparison with military crimes or crimes against humanity. But in the hands of the ISS this is possible, because in the Roman statute there is the ability to work on various crimes.

Yes, it is a crime of aggression under the Roman statute. But this situation cannot be put into effect, I explained because of the specific situation of Russia _(The Russian Federation signed, but was unattractive, and in 2016 Moscow withdrew the signature of the document. –Aut.)._

Але можливе і розслідування справи про геноцид. Я не випадково сказав, що мипочали дискусію на початку березня минулого року з Євроюстом і «Мережеюгеноциду» _(_ _Eurovist network for investigation and judicial persecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. - Avt.)_. We want all available tools.

I just want to be sure that all the prosecutors responsible for the formation of the position could go to the court where they already have to make a decision.

You know that in the past it was the most sufficient decision in the event of investigation of the crime of genocide in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. In Ukraine, Eco -Comand of the ISS.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-03T95-00-00-04-00/5-4.jpg)Even during the war, we intend to create a reliable decision to be sure that during life, military criminals should know that there is a rice to be a court or a tribunal.

** - ** ** What are your impressions of cooperation with Ukrainian colleagues? **

- From the beginning of the Russian large -scale invasion, I first and foremost contact the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Also with Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova and then Andrew Kostin. We tried to be very specific, and we were convinced that it was very effective. For us, it was and remains the real part of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, European and all the instruments that Ya - Litted earlier. But it was also a clear message for us that we are working for a common purpose - punishment of criminals.

It notes that the number one is currently increasing the number of recent weapons:

- The Ukrainian air defense has strengthened significantly, first of all, it is the achievement of our people, which constantly improve skills, maneuvering, trying to predict where the next blow is building. Of course, without Western weapons-NASAMS, Iris-T, Patriot-we would not be able to show such incredible results. With the advent of Patriot, we have also been able to destroy ballistic goals. In modern systems, the human factor is minimized, they are automatic capacity. The advantages include the high speed of rockets, a long range, a pumped outlet system.

Denis Skodzhizh notes that at dawn on February 24, 22, firmly approved to destroy everything they saw in the air. However, now this decision is supported by a serious argument in the form of powerful air defense complexes.

-If at the beginning of the war we knocked a third of the calibers and the X-101 missiles, then it was considered a great success at that time,-says the officer. - Today we make 80 percent of such goals, and in some cases we demonstrate the ratio. This is the merit of not only anti -aircraft groups, but also mobile groups, fighter aviation and other structures and troops. We work for the result!

And although now the experts are not for celebrations, and to relax through constant nighttime attacks, the anti -aircraft attacks rarely succeed, Denis Pasti promised: “Let's win!And then we will rest!And we celebrate!”.

About it on the air of the nationwide TELEXON "The only news" of the Talazalaspanpian of the Minister of Defense Anna Malyar, Ukrinform reports.

"Since January, the main directions of the enemy's offensive are Eastern - Avdiivsky, Maryansky, Kupyansky, Liman.(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-bahmut)where they can also do nothing. They did not take control of the city and could not get out of it, by the way, too. We make it a dynamics, but somewhat different. The enemy cannot move that slyvin does not use. They threw out a huge amount of equipment, weapons, and a huge number of people were killed. The many months of Bakhmut's battle for them is a bustard, and they did nothing. Therefore, when we say that the fighting is ongoing, or in this direction there is no advancement, it does not mean that there is nothing there or that it is someone's shortage, " - said Malyar.

The Deputy Minister noted that the effectiveness of the defense forces is measured not by the distance, which managed to move forward, or the number of released points. Another criterion she called the number of enemy -destroyed personnel, the number of equipment, places of compact crowd of Russian military.

"If all this was not destroyed, it would go to us. Two weeks in a row and half a day, and in the east, our military destroy about 100 places of compact -sighing of Russian military. These are those military who could go here and go. Less than 10 points of management every week, from where weapons come from, UAV, every week about 20 warehouses of enemy weapons. And the equipment.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-04T14-21-00-03-00/630_360_1688502148-599.jpeg)Now the world must be aware that the joint safety depends entirely to the off -global attention to the actions of the invaders at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: the world sees which scripts are preparing to be terrorists, and the Svetrozhtovy react.

The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his address at the end of the 496th day of the war, Ukrinform reports.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ **

He has just completed the conversation with Mr. French President Macron, and this is the third international negotiations for today-after talking to the Secretary-General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The main thing is our defense, front, weapons, the capabilities of our warriors, and I am grateful to partners for understanding our needs. We were given new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for that something today began to come and weapons we agreed on , Rockets, tanks.

But, of course, they also talked about more strategic things - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.

In order for the world to come faster and to be long, honest, true, Russian evil must not be the line for the Kremlin's ambitions. We are all the free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.

We add the content of the NATO summit daily, which will take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the web strengthening of the Alliance, and therefore, for safety in Europe - real safety. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.

He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.

It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.

Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees-and cannot feel!- that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is exactly Russia. And no one else.

Unfortunately, there was no timely and large -scale response to a terrorist attack against the Kakhovsky hydroelectric power plant. And it can inspire the Kremlin to a new evil.

To stop it is the duty of everyone in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.

I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.

One more.

Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people have been injured, 12 of them were children, two were babies, they have less than a year ... As of this time, rescuers, together with police officers, still carry out the trading homes. Everyone who was injured in this missile blow will provide the necessary help.

And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.

Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life replies - fairly and inevitably - every stroke of every terrorist.

The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.

By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about the new challenges of our security, a common situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...

We know how to put terrorists in place.

Thank you all our soldiers!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

"While Ukraine is in a state of war, it cannot become a member of NATO," Scholt said, adding that NATO's membership criteria are "absence of open -headed conflicts."

However, according to him, it is important to "great practical support of Ukraine" on the part of Noto, which will continue in the future.

"Germany has created the conditions to even support Ukraine if it lasts for a long time," he said.

"Many countries will be able to assist within one, two, three, and if it is more than more years, because we do not know how long a long -term conflict," the head of the German government added.

According to Ukrinform, the relevant decision was approved by the Government on July 4, 2023, reports [press service of the Ministry of Economy](https://www.me.gov.ua/News/Detail?lang=uk-UA&id=3c957f03-c96f-4566-a6ba-265da5517782&title=UriadVdoskonalivRobotuElektronnogoKataloguProzorroMarket).

«Ми провели дослідження для того, щоб спростити роботу усіх користувачів вProzorro Market. Опитавши замовників та постачальників, ми внесли рядвдосконалень. Основна докорінна зміна полягає в тому, що тепер усі закупівлі вProzorro Market будуть відбуватися через запит пропозицій. Інструмент запитупропозицій у Prozorro Market, як і раніше дозволить замовникам швидкозакривати свої потреби без підготовки тендерної документації», - пояснилазаступник міністра економіки Надія Бігун.

**Читайте також:** [ Упродовж п’яти років у **Prozorro** .Продажі оголошували17,5 тисячі аукціонів малої приватизації ](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3731322-uprodovz-pati-rokiv-u-prozorroprodazi-ogolosuvali-175-tisaci-aukcioniv-maloi-privatizacii.html)She noted that on average, such a purchase will last up to 10 days. In addition, the VZamovnik will always receive favorable offers, because he will receive an order that will be able to offer the best price

Previously, when purchases up to 100 thousand hryvnias it was possible to make direct orders of the catalog. In fact, the purchase process was similar to the purchase of a conventional online store. However, research and surveys of users have shown that these prices did not always correspond to the availability of certain goods of suppliers. Therefore, the request allows you to receive more current business proposals and better prices.

Therefore, from now on, the customers who have decided to buy the required product from ProZorromarket, regardless of the amount of purchase, should announce the request and specify the order characteristics of the order. And then the suppliers will be clearly aware of the conditions of supply and will give the current price for specific conditions of the costing.

If the value of the goods is over UAH 500 thousand, then in this case the request must contain information about the characteristics of the product and their allowable values according to the directory profile. There is also a condition that this case should be at least two proposals from suppliers.

In order to reduce manipulation by suppliers, the requirement is required to provide a obligatory projection of the contract in the request of the proposal. The customer is also given the right to reject the winner's offer if he refuses to sign the contract and proceed to the consideration of the next one.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3726748-u-travni-cerez-prozorro-opublikuvali-zakupivel-na-121-milard.html)In the new order of procurement, the concept of procurement profile is removed, instead, the concept of technical specification is introduced. This should be removed by some foolish understanding that has arisen when communicating the product.

As reported, Prozorro Market administrators are three centralized organizations. Professional purchases are filled with consumer catalogs, medical procurement of Ukraine - medicines and medical products, SE "Ukrainian Special Systems" - computer equipment and software. Today, the range of Prozorro Market has about 90 thousand works of 3 thousand skilled suppliers.

Therefore, in the West, in particular in Europe, it is now occupied by what the scripts of the collapse of the Russian Federation can be.

This opinion expressed [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101779)The President of the Center for Globalism "Strategy 21" Mikhail Gonchar, commenting on the statement of the NSDC Secretary Oleksiydanilov, that the event should prepare for the collapse of the Russian Federation, because Dictator Vladimir Putinvated control over his country, Ukrinform reports.

According to the expert, the Russian Federation is not mono -ethnic and not a mono -confessional state. It is a conglomerate of different peoples, ethnic groups with different denominational parameters. The term "federation" in the name of this country does not correspond to the real state of things. Therefore, it is possible to hold all this conglomerate for a monolithic state for a long time, but not all the time, Gonchar notes.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3728310-u-es-rozgladaut-scenarij-rozpadu-rosii-posol-ukraini.html)In his opinion, the collapse of Russia is a matter of time, as evidenced by the studies. "In 2021, the topic of Russia's collapse was perceived as exotic imarginal. In 2022, this issue was already discussed. In 2023 we see, for example, that serious studies began to be published. In particular, the work of Janusz Bugai was recently presented State. Instructions on Rounding Russia ", which refers to scenarios that may have a place in the event of its collapse, which is not considered as such" will be or will not ". The question is only the time when it happens. Last week in Slovakia, a book of prominent Slovak was present in Slovakia Futurologist Yurai Mesika "2023: Ricmate of the Russian Empire. Of course, including the scenarios of the prolongation of the Putin state, the repressive state, but with the understanding that the potential existence is completed, " - explains the expert."It is not quite correct to ask whether the Russian collapse will take place this year, or next or 5 years.

"So, since the war is absorbing more and more resources, somewhere in Yakutia and in the European part of Russia will be more and more aware of practical decisions" just in case ". It will not be immediately open -minded against the federal center, because it is still powerful. But the fragility of the Federal Center does not take advantage of the lazy, "the expert summed up.

As reported by Ukrinform, Secretary of the Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexeydanilov in a speech at the International Conference "Ukraine and NATO of the Prednivnia Summit: on support through the victory of membership" stated that the interruption of the rebellion of the leader of the PEC "Wagner" Yevgeny Prigogin started his transparent.

In addition, Ukraine constantly highlights the facts that can testify to the preparation of the next thermal, such as the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station.

However, on the other hand, according to Yusov, such informational campaigns and pins can be conducted as preparation and information cover for true terrorist actions.

"But now we do not see any significant change at the station. However, it is worthwhile to vote that the station continues to be under the control to complete the preparation for the terrorist attack. But it is now about raising the degree of nuclear space, conducting IPSO in order to sow panic in Ukrainian society to reduce Ukrainian defenders, "Yusov said.

“I knew him from a teenage age. He grew up, courageous in my eyes. As if he lives according to his separate rules. He was the embodiment of justice in power. He was in the way to master the temperament, put it in shackles, keep it on the chains and release his Kraken to fight evil. But the damned warfare of his life. Wad in peace. You have done a lot in this life. Your law will live forever, ”he wrote the day before in [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Baksheiev.Mykola/posts/pfbid0t4dWNo3Fb2QgfoqDfEtFazH3V1RkaGZT8yF4qpZwnMfnHBnt9CL8vkWSkdi5GP8kl)Mayor of Pervomaisk Mykola Baksheev.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-04T1-58-00-03-00/630_360_1667561515-584.jpg)The high representative of the EU commented on the lessons that the European Union and the World Security Committee should be taken out of attempts by the military rebellion that the Russian state.

According to Ukrinform, about it in its own blog [on the website of the European External Action]](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/what-conclusions-should-we-draw-prigozhins-mutiny_en?channel=eeas_press_alerts&date=2023-07-04&newsid=0&langid=en&source=mail)The high representative of the EU Josep Borrel wrote.

The first lesson, in his opinion, is that the aggressive war against Ukraine Vladimir Putin's weakening is much more than many observers thought. "Angry 2022, it seemed to continue or even strengthened his authority, despite some devastating defeat of the Russian army in Ukraine. At the same time, the viewing was reported that the Russian economy was not(still)Seriously affected by the war. The rebellion of Prigogine and the fact that almost no force has resisted the capture of the main Russian headquarters in the war of anti -Ukraine, as well as then - the march to Moscow, showed the entire depth of split by the Urosian army and in the state apparatus, "Borsel wrote.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3731386-u-rozvidci-vvazaut-so-prigozin-u-bilorusi-buvatime-ale-ne-bazuvatimetsa.html)He recalled that on June 27, Putin for the first time publicly acknowledged that the Wagner Group really received massive support and financing by the Russian state. According to Borrel, Putin created a monster, and now this monster began to bite himself. The fact that a group of mercenaries funded by the state opened fire to a regular army demonstrates the degree of pathology of Putin Russia.

The high representative of the EU called "symbolic", which before the planned rebellious Prishozhin opposed the official narrative, which the Kremlin uses in attempts to go to the war, and denied any reports of aggressive Planikiev or NATO. Instead, he accused the Defense Minister Shoigu of spreading for the sake of personal ambitions. Borrel expressed his hope that more and more people around the world would be asked to be asked by a monipulative official narrative, which Putin, Lavrov and others spread about this.** Read also: ** [Chubarov binds statements about the attempt on Aksenov with a rebellion ** Prigogine ** a](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-crimea/3730861-cubarov-povazue-zaavi-pro-zamah-na-aksonova-z-buntom-prigozina.html)According to him, the increasing risk of instability that is the result of a rebellion, especially dangerous in a country that has nuclear weapons. One prudent conclusions coming out of the Russian aggressive war are that Poutin Russia poses the greatest threat to European and global security, since its nuclear arsenal does not reduce, but only increases the danger of a civilized world.

“This is another reason why we must continue to support the Armed Forces in the withdrawal of Russian troops away from the country. The victory of Ukraine is the best way to achieve a just peace, based on the international right that Ukraine needs and deserves. Such peace can also open the process of change for Russia, which is a prerequisite for a long -haired shape. Russian history shows that when the changes occur, they can quickly. We have to be prepared for this, ”Borrel said.

It was reported that on June 23, a military rebellion took place in Russia, during which Wagner group seized a military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, installed full control over the city and moved to Moscow, without meeting almost no lineage, except for the task of air strikes by government. strength. Finally, the leader of the Wagner PEC Yevgeny Prigogin abandoned his plans, a jerk "unwillingness to shed Russian blood." Meanwhile, the large -scale arrests of the Russian generals indicate that the rebellion was a wider plan, the knife of the head of the Wagner group himself.

According to Ukrinform, it reports [Presidential Office](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/mizhnarodna-robocha-grupa-yermaka-makfola-predstavila-novij-84053).

International Working Group on Sanctions Against Ermak-Macfola, Presentation Report(№ 12), aimed at limiting the access of Russian MIC of dozid technologies.

The head of the head of state stated that this document contains a conviction of how the Western components continue to contribute to a full -scale invasion of the Nazi and the war against Ukraine. The Russian Rocket X-101, which killed 11 people, including one child on June 13, in the five-storey residential building Kryvyi Rih, contained 53 critical components obtained by outmodic countries, Yermak reminded.

"In the case of their implementation, we will substantially limit Russia to produce noviracks and replenish our arsenal," Yermak emphasized.

He stressed that in the second half of 2022 it was able to restore and even exceed the extent of the exquisite level of import of critical components for the production of variant weapons.

"All the information contained in this report, and we have passed all the evidence to our international partners, and now we expect decisive, quick and effective actions," Yermak reported.

In particular, the micro -chips of Western production have been discovered in each type of type, which was investigated by Ukrainian authorities.

The analysis of 1057 foreign components of Russian military equipment produced155 companies demonstrates that access to critically important Western technologies from the beginning of the 2022 war and the first quarter of 2023 is in the chain of military deliveries.

The research has shown that critically important components found on the battlefield last year are contained in a wide range of weapons, including rockets, armored vehicles, artillery, helicopters, HRB, etc.

“For 155 companies whose products were identified in Russian weapons, in 2022 it accounted for $ 2.9 billion. At the same time, the supply is almost completely due to thirdicrains, ”said the Secretary of the International Expert Group on the Sanction Uvladyslav Vlasyuk.

According to Ukrinform, about it in its own blog [on the website of the European External Action]](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/what-conclusions-should-we-draw-prigozhins-mutiny_en?channel=eeas_press_alerts&date=2023-07-04&newsid=0&langid=en&source=mail)The high representative of the EU Josep Borrel wrote.

The first lesson, in his opinion, is that the aggressive war against Ukraine Vladimir Putin's weakening is much more than many observers thought. "Angry 2022, it seemed to continue or even strengthened his authority, despite some devastating defeat of the Russian army in Ukraine. At the same time, the viewing was reported that the Russian economy was not(still)Seriously affected by the war. The rebellion of Prigogine and the fact that almost no force has resisted the capture of the main Russian headquarters in the war of anti -Ukraine, as well as then - the march to Moscow, showed the entire depth of split by the Urosian army and in the state apparatus, "Borsel wrote.

*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3731386-u-rozvidci-vvazaut-so-prigozin-u-bilorusi-buvatime-ale-ne-bazuvatimetsa.html)He recalled that on June 27, Putin for the first time publicly acknowledged that the Wagner Group really received massive support and financing by the Russian state. According to Borrel, Putin created a monster, and now this monster began to bite himself. The fact that a group of mercenaries funded by the state opened fire to a regular army demonstrates the degree of pathology of Putin Russia.

The high representative of the EU called "symbolic", which before the planned rebellious Prishozhin opposed the official narrative, which the Kremlin uses in attempts to go to the war, and denied any reports of aggressive Planikiev or NATO. Instead, he accused the Defense Minister Shoigu of spreading for the sake of personal ambitions.

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-07-04T23-21-00-03-00/630_360_1688502148-599.jpeg)Now the world must be aware that the joint safety depends entirely to the off -global attention to the actions of the invaders at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: the world sees which scripts are preparing to be terrorists, and the Svetrozhtovy react.

The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his address at the end of the 496th day of the war, Ukrinform reports.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians, Ukrainian women!_ **

He has just completed the conversation with Mr. French President Macron, and this is the third international negotiations for today-after talking to the Secretary-General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The main thing is our defense, front, weapons, the capabilities of our warriors, and I am grateful to partners for understanding our needs. We were given new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for that something today began to come and weapons we agreed on , Rockets, tanks.

But, of course, they also talked about more strategic things - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.

In order for the world to come faster and to be long, honest, true, Russian evil must not be the line for the Kremlin's ambitions. We are all the free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.

We add the content of the NATO summit daily, which will take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the web strengthening of the Alliance, and therefore, for safety in Europe - real safety. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.

He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.

It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.

Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees-and cannot feel!- that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is exactly Russia. And no one else.

Unfortunately, there was no timely and large -scale response to a terrorist attack against the Kakhovsky hydroelectric power plant. And it can inspire the Kremlin to a new evil.

To stop it is the duty of everyone in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.

I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.

One more.

Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people have been injured, 12 of them were children, two were babies, they have less than a year ... As of this time, rescuers, together with police officers, still carry out the trading homes. Everyone who was injured in this missile blow will provide the necessary help.

And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.

Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life replies - fairly and inevitably - every stroke of every terrorist.

The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.

By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about the new challenges of our security, a common situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...

We know how to put terrorists in place.

Thank you all our soldiers!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_ **

About this [reported](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-169-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine-0)On the IAEA site.

"Although the reconstruction of the power transmission line is positive, the situation with the external power supply of the station remains very vulnerable, which emphasizes the unreliable situation with nuclear security and security on the facility," the Gross CEO Gross CEO.

Connection of the ZPP to a single power line 330 kilovolts(QV)Flewing from six such reserve lines to the conflict, 1 March was broken due to damage on the other bank of the Dnieper River and restored on the evening of July 1. Work on the restoration of the power line was complicated because of a complex security situation in the southern region.

The reconstruction of the 330 kV line is important because in the last few months, the ZPP has relied on a single main line of 750 kV for external electricity required to cool the reactor and other important functions of nuclear safety. Before the conflict began in February 2022, there were four lines of 750 square meters.

Currently, the 330 kV line is under voltage and is stored as a backup and ready -to -feed ZPP, if the 750 kV line becomes unavailable or damaged.

During the conflict, it has lost its power supply to the site of seven times outside the site, which causes it to temporarily use emergency diesel generators.

Military analyst Petro Chernyk during online inclusion in [Military Mediacenter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAsH8snmV5s)He told in what phase the Ukrainian counter -offensive, what difficulties faced the Ukrainian and how they are overcome.

-Any classic military operation has four stages, especially if it is staging. The first is the beginning, the second is the development of success, then the fixing and end. We are currently under development, especially a half -day bridgehead, - said Petro Chernik.

At the same time, he emphasized that, in his opinion, in our society there was a hiking narrative that this operation should be obligatory as in Kharkiv.

- She was really shiny. However, the enemy has made some conclusions and cannot be underestimated. They built such a specific line "Surovikin", as they call it, - noted the military analyst. In my opinion, the most important rule of this war is not rustle. Such a phenomenon as "Zhukshchyna", which was used by the Russians at the storm of Bakhmut and put a tremendous number of personal composition and equipment there, not acceptable for us

In addition, the military emphasized that in his opinion, this operation has all the characteristics of the Serson.

- The operation began there in July last year, and the successful result was a zeal. So three months of very hard work. Then the logistics and ugly zashmorgliness justified himself. There was a constant destruction of their ammunition, fuel and lubricants, and especially artillery. According to the indicators, in June, 688 trunks of enemy artillery were destroyed, which is almost 10 brigades. It is something unlikely and it is, in fact, a historical indicator, - Petro Chernyk summed up.

Modern war is 95% of artillery war, and Ukraine should increase their artillery capabilities,-emphasized the military analyst Petro Chernik during online exclusion in [Military Media Center](https://youtu.be/bAsH8snmV5s).

За словами експерта, сьогодні філософія артилерійського успіху полягає упереважанні української якості над російською кількістю.

— Противник не має і не матиме таких контрбатарейних систем, як AN/TPQ-36, 48,50. У росіян є «Зоопарк», але він і близько не витримує конкуренції іззахідними зразками, — зауважив експерт.

Водночас за рахунок кількісної переваги в артилерії російські військаспроможні вдаватися до тактики вогневих валів, вистрілюючи до 40 тис. снарядівна добу, що для української артилерії — недосяжна кількість.

Російський ВПК може виробляти до 120 тис. снарядів різних калібрів щомісяця,тоді як США зможуть вийти на показник у 50 тис. на місяць у кращому разі накінець серпня — початок вересня.

Натомість Україна має перевагу в номенклатурі ствольної та реактивноїартилерії, яка забезпечує набагато точніше ураження. Тож головним питанням,яке потребує подальшої уваги, є кількість артилерійських систем на озброєнніЗСУ — її потрібно неухильно нарощувати.

Петро Черник висловив стриманий оптимізм щодо цього питання, оскількиамериканський воєнно-промисловий комплекс запрацював і неухильно нарощує своїспроможності.

Involvement of units of Wagner PEC for a new offensive on Ukraine from the territory of Belarus is unlikely.

This opinion was expressed by a military analyst Colonel Petro Chernik during inclusion [Military Media Center](https://t.me/militarymediacenter).

За його словами, на момент заколоту ця пвк, згідно з заявами, налічувала до 25тис. осіб і мала важке озброєння, яке наразі має повернутися у розпорядженняміноборони рф. При цьому, з огляду на торішній досвід для організації операційна цьому напрямку противник потребуватиме наявності щонайменше 40 тис. корпусуу супроводі 825 танків, 2,5 тис. бойових машин і щонайменше 1 тис. артсистем.

Крім того, враховуючи болотисту й лісову місцевість противнику, як і минулогоразу, доведеться рухатися дорогами, на яких ЗСУ вже навчилися зустрічатипротивника. До цього ж треба враховувати проведене Силами оборони мінуванняцього напрямку, яке подекуди сягає до 2 км глибини.

«Якщо вирішать рештки цього кримінального угруповання умогилити у наших лісах— ласкаво просимо», — резюмував експерт.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-04T85-00-00-04-00/golovna-38.jpg)Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar, greeting the American people by the US independence, thanked for the unchanged support, which helps him to elevate freedom, destroy the enemy and protect common values.

She wrote about it in [telegrams](https://t.me/annamaliar/905).

«Одним із найпотужніших проявів підтримки є M142 HIMARS — реактивна системазалпового вогню американського виробництва, розроблена наприкінці 90-х якполегшена колісна версія М270. У своєму арсеналі HIMARS має чималу кількістьрізних боєприпасів: від звичайних некерованих, до високоточних балістичнихракет з GPS навігацією», — зазначила заступник Міністра оборони.

**Боєприпаси та дальність їх ураження:**

MLRS — 45 км;

GMLRS — 70 км;

ER GMLRS — 150 км;

ATACMS — 300 км експериментальна ракета;

PrSM — 499 км.

«Поява американських "Хаймарсів" в червні 2022 року стала неприємноюнесподіванкою для російських військових. Виявилось, що всі логістичні шляхи,склади з боєприпасами та місця дислокації військ перебувають в зоні ураженняреактивної системи», — наголосила вона.

Злякавшись та відчувши перші величезні втрати, як зазначила Ганна Маляр,окупанти почали полювання на HIMARS'и.

«Але й досі нікого й не впіймали. Завдяки максимальній швидкості 85 км/годHIMARS здатна розгорнутися, відстрілятися та покинути позицію менш ніж за 1хв. Це дає змогу застосовувати її для тактики shoot-and-scoot (Shoot-and-Tikai)which significantly reduces the chances of being revealed and amazed by the enemy, ” - the addctor of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

Anna Malyar Navala known cases of HIMARS:

1. On January 1, 2023, a high -precision strike on a VET building in Makiivka, when from a variety of data, from a hundred to 600 mobilized Russians were killed. 2. Destruction of the base of the invaders in the village of the right saga, near Oleshok.

“For Ukrainian military, Himars have become a real weapon of victory. After all, "one rocket is one destroyed goal" is an unattainable result for outdated Soviet counterparts, "Anna Malyar summarized.

We have argued for new defensive packages, and, by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for something today, and weapons, which we agreed, started to come with something. , Rockets, tanks.

But, of course, they talked about more strategic things today - about which the security foundation of Europe will be after this war and our victory.

In order for the world to come faster and to be long, honest, true, Russian evil must not be the line for the Kremlin's ambitions. It is we who are all free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their blackmail and aggression.

We add the content of the NATO summit daily to take place in Vilnius of the Venan Week, and I am grateful to all our partners who work together with the Alliance Strengthening, and therefore, for security in Europe, real security in Europe. Today, talking to France, with the Prime Minister of Sweden and See and General, coordinated our steps in front of Vilnius.

He also held several meetings with government officials and our team of office internationals on training for foreign policy activities that will take place in the near future.

It is very important - about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Now all the light is conscious that the common safety depends entirely on global consumption to the actions of the occupiers at the station. Russia must be clearly aware: it is a light to which scripts are preparing for terrorists, and the world is ready to react.

Radiation is a threat to all in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be completely supported from any radiation incidents. Today, exactly 16 months, as Russian military, fully control the territory and structures of the Zaporozhye NPPs. In different states of the world there are their own intelligence and other opportunities to accurately recognize what is happening and who is guilty of it.

Now, from our intelligence, we have information that on the roof of several Gergers of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Station, Russian military placedly -led with explosives. Maybe to simulate a stroke on the station. They may have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees-and cannot die!- that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is the one. And no one else.To stop it is the duty of all in the world, and no one can leave the scene, because radiation leaves no one away.

I thank Mr. Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZPP and for his willingness to do everything he needed to guarantee safety.

One more.

Today, Russia has once again hit Kharkiv region, in the city of Pervomaisky. Iskander is likely. Eight ordinary high -rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people were injured, 12 of them were children, two are babies, they have less than a year ... Staff this time rescuers, together with police, still bypassing damaged buildings. Everyone who was injured in this rocket stroke will be provided with any necessary assistance.

And for this blow the enemy will be responsible, as well as all other blows.

Russian terrorists want to become model in how they destroy their lives. We will be model in how life we protect and how life answers - fairly and inevitably - every terrorist is struck.

The Nazis tried to escape from justice. Quite a long time. But many of them have been found and are still held accountable. We catch the racists much faster.

By the way, now I will still have a meeting with the Interior Minister Klimenko Taerivist to the baby's security service - and about new challenges to our security, a general situation. There was also a meeting today with intelligence ...

We know how to put terrorists in place.

Thank you all our soldiers!

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**

Natalia Humeniuk, the head of the united News, reported this in the Emergency of the Unified News Telelorphone.

- During this day, the Russians fired at the Ukrainian authorities controlled by the temporarily occupied Kinburn Spit, thus trying to draw the attention of defense forces from the actions of the Russian units located along the Dnieper River, - the speaker said.

According to Humeniuk, the enemy is increasingly expanding the tactical aviation area. Now, not only Berislavsky but the Icherson district is suffering from Russian airplaces - today the occupiers have killed twice from the air today.

- In this way, Russian invaders are trying to avoid the concentration of the Ukrainian forces, - said the head of the united coordination press center of defense of southern Ukraine.

Humeniuk also reported that the artillery gunshots have recently intensified - the occupiers managed to return to the former positions, where the water had already drawn after the flood caused by the blast of Kakhovka hydroelectric power station.

According to the speaker, the invaders continue to distribute efforts along the front line, since they are aware that the maximum pressure from Ukrainian units comes to the Zaporozhye direction - especially on land. In addition, Russian invaders actively use small sabotage groups on boats to learn about the ideas of Ukrainian units located on the left bank of the Dnieper.

- Therefore, almost daily in our summates there is information about the destruction of such readers and groups of occupiers. In total, 66 invaders, 2 puffs, 8 pieces of equipment and a hostile, which were discovered above the Mykolaiv region, were damaged in this direction. It is the detection of the intelligence who is the preparation of the occupiers of rocket and okoque blows to the vigor. I ask not to ignore air alarm signals, especially at night, ”Humeniuk reported.
