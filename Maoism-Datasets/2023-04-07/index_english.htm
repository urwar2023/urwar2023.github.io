<p>Mentally we are in constant stress. And at the particular moment when I asked the question, I was in a deadly danger. And in these circumstances, we have to conform with representatives of aggressors, because WTA decided to non-remedy. Ukrainians are in such circumstances because of Russia's activities Tabilorus. That is, these countries have consciously created an advantage for their players against us. Nobody answered my question ... I repeated it once, and once again, and again and again ... until we heard the answer from Sloanstivens. She said she did not quite understand what I mean, saying about equal conditions, but the advice of players is ready to help Ukrainians and they wanted to lick what they can do for us. I want to point out that communication was the first time since the beginning of the war. This conversation was not interested in what can and should help Ukrainians who suffer from war, ”Kostyuk said.</p>

<p>He told about it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“We have examples of two parallel organizations - the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee. But they are working at this point. As I communicated with Mr. Valeryzushkevich, who heads the Paralympic Committee of Ukraine, he told me how they achieved not only the not admission of these athletes, even in the case of talking about the possible return of Russian representatives and Belarusine. Plus, they generally brought Russian representatives to Tabilorus from membership of the entire organization. This is a large -scale sidelines there. From the other side we hear Mr. Gutzait's statements about the fact that he was sending out letters, but we see an urgent result, ”Beleniuk explained.</p>
<p>He emphasized that arguments to allow Russians and Belarusians to the competition see cynical.</p>
<p>“I think that it is not for the Russians to say about discrimination in those conditions when the Ukrainian athletes are not only able to lose their relatives and close ones. They are relocated to other locations in Europe, or simply temporarily displaced persons who are in the boundaries of their homes and train on the western part of our country. Sametaki arguments would definitely be relevant in order to communicate at the Rivonon with these speakers, who somehow very much consider this story. We start to do this when the situation has flared up, struggling directly with the consequences, then, of course, it is more difficult for us, ”Beleniuk said.</p>
<p>The Olympic champion is convinced that it is necessary to fight to the end in order to prevent Russians from games in Paris.</p>
<p>“Athletes call me calling for the fact that they do not understand their prospects at all. Whether they need to play sports, whether they can already tie sports and go to work for some other work. My position in this situation, which I voiced before, sounds as follows: it was necessary to fight Israz to fight for removing Russian Tabilorus representatives from competitions. Because otherwise athletes will become hostages. And we do not want us to have a similar choice, ” - Odbeleniuk.As reported by Ukrinform, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided that Ukrainian athletes will compete at international tournaments, which will be presented with athletes of Irrigation and Belarus.</p>

Both forens, iturms, and assaults, and attacks are the regime of terror in which the Russians will live long, .. Not everyone wants to put up with it, "Yusov said.</p>
<p>According to him, there is "an aspect of enslaved peoples and their awakening, the realization that <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia"></a>They use them as cannon meat, including in the war against Ukraine. "</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Energy and Housing and Communal Services Andriy Gerus in [] told about it <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/podcasts/63bff58767d28/2023/04/6/7396757/"></a>.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that in March, we could earn up to UAH 500 million if we had electricity exports. If you take in dollars, it is about 25 million. It is big money, and so nowadays, when every penny is needed to finance military expenditures and for the budget, I would fought for this money, ”Gerus said.</p>

However, today there is fears that when there will be no electricity due to network restrictions, and exports will be exported.</p>
<p>“If there is not enough electricity in the country, then it is impossible to export, but if in the country of electricity is enough, but in a separate town or village it will not be due to damage to networks, then this is not a reason for stopping export. Even if the export does not go, the light in this case will not appear there. And selling and receiving money can be a resource for restoring substations, ”Gerus emphasized.</p>

<p>About it reports Polish radio <a href="https://www.rmf24.pl/raporty/raport-wojna-z-rosja/news-polska-chce-uderzyc-w-rosyjska-energetyke-jadrowa,nId,6704122#crp_state=1"></a>With reference to the document of March 30, which was sent for consultation to EU countries, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>The document proposes to expand the sanction list at the expense of the Rosatom Member Department, as well as the prohibition of signing new agreements with this company, the prohibition of investment in the Russian nuclear power sector, as well as the ban on the EU of Russian -enriched uranium.</p>

However, they offer some exceptions and transitional periods. In particular, the abandonment of contracts with "Rosatom" should take place gradually, but not longer than two years. Instead, Hungary would have received nine years of the transition period, which would allow it to complete the construction of NPP in Pax, which is on Russian technology.</p>
<p>The authors of the document assure that EU countries are gradually refusing to work with Russia in the field of nuclear energy. In particular, last year, the Czech Republic was not allowed by Rosatom to the tender for the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the country. Finlanda also refused to cooperate with this Russian company in the construction of a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>However, as the publication notes, to get the consent to the introduction <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-antirosijski-sankcii"></a>Against "Rosatom" it is difficult. This would require consent from all EU countries.</p>
<p>However, Hungary and France, as well as Bolgaria, which are largely dependent on Russian technologies, have not been agreed to this many times, and France is easy to refuse cooperation with the Russian Federation in this area.</p>

<p>He told about it exclusively in a comment to Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>“We have examples of two parallel organizations - the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee. But they are working at this point. As I communicated with Mr. Valeryzushkevich, who heads the Paralympic Committee of Ukraine, he told me how they achieved not only the not admission of these athletes, even in the case of talking about the possible return of Russian representatives and Belarusine. Plus, they generally brought Russian representatives to Tabilorus from membership of the entire organization. This is a large -scale sidelines there. From the other side we hear Mr. Gutzait's statements about the fact that he was sending out letters, but we see an urgent result, ”Beleniuk explained.</p>
<p>He emphasized that arguments to allow Russians and Belarusians to the competition see cynical.</p>
<p>“I think that it is not for the Russians to say about discrimination in those conditions when the Ukrainian athletes are not only able to lose their relatives and close ones. They are relocated to other locations in Europe, or simply temporarily displaced persons who are in the boundaries of their homes and train on the western part of our country. Sametaki arguments would definitely be relevant in order to communicate at the Rivonon with these speakers, who somehow very much consider this story. We start to do this when the situation has flared up, struggling directly with the consequences, then, of course, it is more difficult for us, ”Beleniuk said.</p>
<p>The Olympic champion is convinced that it is necessary to fight to the end in order to prevent Russians from games in Paris.</p>
<p>“Athletes call me calling for the fact that they do not understand their prospects at all. Whether they need to play sports, whether they can already tie sports and go to work for some other work. My position in this situation, which I voiced before, sounds as follows: it was necessary to fight Israz to fight for removing Russian Tabilorus representatives from competitions. Because otherwise athletes will become hostages. And we do not want us to have a similar choice, ” - Odbeleniuk.As reported by Ukrinform, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided that Ukrainian athletes will compete at international tournaments, which will be presented with athletes of Irrigation and Belarus.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_02101.jpg" /><strong> Group K2 soldiers published on their </strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D0%BA2"><strong> YouTub channel </strong></a><strong> A series of videos that will soon become part of the classical newspaper, military historians and theorists will be relied on documentary personnel, describing and exploring the significant and bloody path of Ukrainians to victory over Russian invaders. </strong> **</p>
<h3><strong> Rashists do not want to pick up their dead from the battlefield </strong></h3>
<p>Fighting episodes "battle for T-shaped" in miniature are demonstrated to the entire large-scale war, the likelihood of which was the probability of which another 10 years were weighing in the world by the absurd. At that time, no one seriously considered the possibilities in Europe, even "border incidents", and even more so "regional low -intensity conflicts" - as those who did not see the latter who did not see in 2014 the beginning of the unjust and criminal Russian.</p>
<p>In turn, the war also does not ask whether someone wants to see her and why she was called - she just comes without permission and to everyone as equal. It destroys the agenda every hour, forms a list of probables of tomorrow's day. The Ukrainian today determines what the post -war world will be - on what basic values it will be rebuilt, the grounds for what principles and guarantees will become reliable and safe. And as much as it will be.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0161.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0161-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0168.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0168-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0183.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0183-150x150.jpg" /></a>In a few days, the K2 Video has already watched millions of people from all over the world - they are sure that tens of millions will see it in the future. And they will almost be able to observe how, in one of the hundreds of such supporting, the front line of the front line, Ukrainians beat heroically. They stand, protecting from the enemy not just the edge of the field, where two boarding of old acacia and oaks meet. They defend their own freedom and the future of their children. Defend the right to live and work on their land by their own laws. Nurture children in love and abundance. To decide what to sow with whom to make friends with and which to believe God.The names of those who died in unequal battle but did not give the enemy of their native land, they are forever etched in national memory, and their hamstring will be decent to the following generations.</p>
<p>Who were and how the invaders were called, whose remains were still scattered on the battlefield, their exact number - it is unlikely that anyone will be able to install it for sure. No one came in a hundred corpses - he did not invite the "hour of truce" for the harvesting of bodies, did not ask for mediation from organizations or structures that are authored for similar events, nothing like that - they still lie there. The author saw dozens of bodies of the Russian sample.</p>
<p>It is only known that it is "Wagnerivtsi" - another neologism and phenomenon of time of hybrid war.</p>
<p>The war, when it appears in the middle of people, always, though in its own way, but forces them to stop the fire for a while - for a short constructive conversation, the essence of which usually comes down to the need to take the battlefields and the wounded.</p>
<p>And if we recall the historians and theorists of the wars of the past, such contacts of the Taneuhile Following the achieved arrangements formed a code of honor of the warrior their unwritten rules of war. Usually, after great upheaval, militaryelitis turned into a military-political and took responsibility for the further development of their country and determined the form of its statehood. By the expensive of military experience, during their internal and foreign policy, they preferred diplomatic resolution of disputes.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0193.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0193-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0196.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0196-150x150.jpg" /></a>Over time, when there was a period of recovery, development and progress, and concluded regulations and formulated rules established after bloody wars, were relevant and were usually violated by the successors of those who did the war. However, the work of previous wars was improved not only by methods of their conduct, but also formed international law.</p>
<p>The Russian aggression ignitors violated the signed treaties and have been taken to sebellia and refused to recognize not only international law but also the law.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0209.jpg" /></p>
<p>As if there was nothing in the history of wars, except for the well -known and demonstration correspondence of the Second World War, one of the Soviet military chiefs of their subordinate. At the request to move away from the occupied borders, who continue to be unpromising, as the unit suffered significant losses, the ammunition was founded, and the replenishment of ammunition was not recognized - the chief went out to the officer. And the views were ordered: "I will go through the Lychnya composition." A historical regression bordering Deevolution ...</p>
<h3><strong> Fighting on the outskirts of Siversk </strong></h3>
<p>The direct participants in the fighting on the outskirts of Siverskaya "Crimea" and "Kachan" lead to T-t-t-t-t-their, show their horrific consequences and tell the details. It is less than a kilometer reckoning, so we work quickly, and when we leave a place - a mortar shelling begins.</p>
<p>In the Kristist army since 2018, first served in artillery, then transferred a pre -emptive unit.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will say, as it is - in artillery I was tight, I decided to try myself inhale. All is well, like the action, so I acquired Gouporo, began to shoot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0204.jpg" />We had a fight here - we took two positions: one took our grandfathers, the other - we did not know about it and at night he moved on us from two directions. While dug, the enemy decided to attack the right flank, then went around and began to step from the left. We met him from the ambush and caused the lesion - so they were all there.</p>
<p>We fought with ZEKs, they did not have enough military experience, they will go - and all. About a hundred, and maybe more ... You saw, there are 30-40 on thirty meters of landing, and planting-he, which is long, and everywhere lies.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0214.jpg" />Some were captured, some were dug alive after our tank. To tell them something - so nothing. They thought they would be to here, and they were given coffee here, they were given, cigarettes - they are shocked. They were tamped by the video - as if we were cooking their heads here. It is horror - they will be so believed, and when they are captured, they see that we are normal people.</p>
<p>What they drive - I think that they have made criminal businesses and sit for fifteen years ... So I think: it is better for half a year, but as and by whom it will be here - I do not even imagine. He came here to kill people to fail to not report to him in Russia.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dsc_0230.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0230-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p>We have seen their artillery beat on them if they start retreating. They are being able to retreat, so they either spend the night in the "gray zone" or just forward. The prisoners said that they were canceled for their retreat - demonstally shot before the routine, ”the man tells.</p>
<p>His brothers on the pseudo "Kachan" during the storming followed the attacking - searched the bodies of servicemen who accepted that first unequal battle. They were dead to the latter, but they were thrown by grenades in the trench they were left. Among those who had to be evacuated were his acquaintances. Those "very good people ..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and as a reminder, technological progress has brought people not only the comfort, convenience and opportunities of the present today, but also a broadcast of copter, which filmed a short moment of the long war.</p>
<p>As in a short moment, good people who have left their loved ones and loved ones, warm and cozy homes, work and hobbies - have taken death in an earthen trench where acacia meet with oaks at the edge of the winter field.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T50-00-00-04-00/dsc_0217.jpg" />Thanks to their habitation and self-sacrifice, in that unequal battle, the enemy was stopped and was deprived of the opportunity to attack the same stronghold points to the left, to break the defense and stick further-even to the t-shaped homes.</p>
<p>There is a punishment for every crime. Someone can call it "provided by law", someone - execution, someone - justice.</p>
<p>Soon the crews of two Ukrainian tanks and a single-fighting machine of infantry came to the T-t-t-t-wing, and in a fair battle they did what they always did in the Ukrainian-persons of their native land with the invaders-turned into a fertile black soil.</p>

<li>Recently, the enemy has been taking air strikes remotely. The difficult goal for our air defense is the helicopters of the Russian Federation, more likely to knock them from the MAPs. They can goal when they rise above and become visible to various means of impression. The aircraft of the Russians causes hundreds of blows remotely, and a new species for us are managed aviation bombs that the enemy has equipped with the wings of TAGPS, but they are currently made "from wheels", - Colonel Yuriyagna, a spokesman for the Air Force " .</li>
</ul>
<p>Yuri Ignat added that such aircraft, mostly Fab-500, fly from far out and fly into the area of the lesion, hitting the frontal area. It is incorporated to knock them down, but the main task is to restrain enemy aviation, because aviation in the air is the most dangerous challenge. At the same time, the Avenger's self-visibility is successfully in the poor visibility of CIs at night.</p>
<p>-I really wanted to get long-range systems as soon as possible-anti-aircraft missile complexes from our foreign partners, and, of course, planes that can solve much in this war. The F-16 or other-the generation of 4+, which has a rocket with a range of up to 180 kilometers, will help here,-summed up Yuri Ignat.</p>

<p>The staff representative assured that the work on the release of all prisoners is not. For the Russian side, nothing weighs the timing of staying and the severity of the injuries, because the enemy has not agreed to release all weighted and sick, women and civilians. The aggressor tries to use our prisoners as a pressure lever on our native, society of Tukraine.</p>
<p>"The main thing that stimulates exchanges is our success at the front," the representative of the Staff said.</p>
<p>They discussed the topic of international responsibility of the Russians for non -compliance with international humanitarian law in the places of keeping our prisoners. The names are constantly being pressed psychologically in captivity so that they move to the biker, but such cases are extremely rare.</p>
<p>The headquarters also noted that in cases where we manage to establish the place of keeping the prisoner, we usually do not inform our family so that this information does not come out. Because when the Russians find out that we have such a miracle, carry a person, which means a new stage, a new "acceptance"-confusing, adaptation to new conditions.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T75-00-00-04-00/foto_1-3.jpg" />The smoke grenade DG-1 was adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2021.</p>

From the air - everything is clean. "It is because these smoke grenades respond to modern combat realities, they are needed at the front," - said the VIEurian with a call sign "producer".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T75-00-00-04-00/foto_3-1.jpg" />- I deployed exit from the point of view of smoke. The pomegranate showed Sefeedobre. With the help of the same pomegranate you can mask the technique, make stretch marks, the same DG-1, but with black smoke, mask from the thermal imaging,-adds the "producer".</p>
<p>But most importantly - the preservation of personnel. This is the possibility of Tzagranat: safely move away, regroup and prepare for battle, evacuated. "The new weapons are satisfied," the military says.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have not yet held Nutov's smoke grenades, but with the Soviet comparable. First, DG-1 is simply more convenient. They are smaller, lighter, just wear them. And, of course, these grenades are more powerful and the mixture burns only 3 seconds, and the smoke curtain lasts for two minutes. And during this time and the Russians are evil to make, and regroup, and retreat in the case of no way, - the producer emphasizes.</li>

<p>Previously, the suspect served for 12 years in the Cathedral of the UOC -MP in Lviv. From 2005 he lived in Kyiv, and in 2014 he fled to Moscow.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T78-00-00-04-00/golovne-foto-povistka.jpg" />Commenting in the heading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tcWjmKwxqY">dovidra.info</a>At the YouTub-Canal Center of Strategic Communications and Information Security Key Principles during the War, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyovazhavzhavzhavzhavzhawa that among hostile information and psychological operations(Paco)One of the most notable nowadays is the attempt to discredit the mobilization campaign, which has been going on since February 24 last year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, most actively people get information, of course, Izocial networks, so information campaigns are directed there, mostly the Telegram, where they come in a comment with whole botocative farms. So you need to answer the question: to achieve the purpose of the directed information, - says Anna Malyar. - Usually, if you understand that it is a wealth of our armed forces or in general our society, it is important that this information is launched by the Russians.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Deputy Minister notes that often the Ukrainians themselves contribute to the propagandists in spreading messages against our country: _ "Often it happens that because of the ignorance and misunderstanding They will say something very important now. ”._</p>
<p>Indeed, from time to time on the World Wide Web we come across rollers that criticize stories on the street, or read the advice of some expert expert in law, as potential conscripts to avoid getting them.</p>
<p>So let's figure out what reports about the mobilization campaign during the time phase of the Russian-Ukrainian War walk the Internet, which of them are relevant, and which have all the signs of falsification or distortion. It is also interesting that in Russia itself mobilization is passing and whether everyone who supports their leader is dreaming of protecting his false ideas with weapons in his hands.</p>
<h3><strong> A small percentage of evidence in no way affects the mobilization campaign in our country </strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T78-00-00-04-00/cherga-u-vijskomat.jpg" />Ternopil, Ukraine, turn to the shopping center and the joint venture</p>
<p>This statement can be denied statistics that have recently been <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/06/ponad-20-tysyach-dobrovolcziv-podaly-zayavky-na-vstup-do-gvardiyi-nastupu/">published</a>In Military Mediacenter, Deputy Director of Planning Department of application of the Main Department of the National Guard of Ukraine Colonel Mykola Urshalovich. According to his information, as of April 6, only before the NSU brigades as part of the formation of units of the Guard of the offensive received 20 204 applications from volunteers. If you take into account the statistics of this campaign in the State Border Service of Tanational Police of Ukraine in general, more than 35,000 candidates dream of weapons.</p>
<p>Of course, among citizens there are those who avoid conscription, try to interfere with the Motherland, however, a small percentage of such evasion in no way is not flooding on a mobilization campaign in our country.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T78-00-00-04-00/rosiya-tikaye-vid-mobilizacziyi.jpeg" />In Russia, a partial mobilization has been announced - the turn of evaders with Georgia</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia's official information resources prefer to close the eyes of Nazonoconfigured in the Crimea and Donbass occupied in the temporarily seized areas of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions. They prefer not to tell about hundreds of thousands of Russian men, who, when the call, were indicated, Georgia, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Finland, Armenia and other countries.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T78-00-00-04-00/bali-rosiyany.jpg" />The injuries state an increase in offenses committed by the Russians. Photo: Balimanual</p>
<p>And the authorities of the Indonesian Bali Island, where 58,000 Russian citizens have departed from the beginning of a large -scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, a statement of the deterioration of the criminogenic situation and is trying to limit the issuance of visas for Russian citizens. About it <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-03-19-23/h_1e417f93630dbcc9a4de2e711383e62c">reports</a>CNN.</p>
<p>In general, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/society/478827-rossiu-posle-21-sentabra-pokinuli-okolo-700-000-grazdan">evaluation</a>Forbes.ru, from the beginning of mobilization - after September 21 last year, when Putin signed a decree "prompting partial mobilization in the Russian Federation", almost 1 million people left the boundaries of his state state.</p>
<h3><strong> From single conflicts on the streets, the statement does not follow that "in Ukraine is ongoing violent mobilization" </strong>Therefore, the Russian daily newspaper writes: “On February 14, in Odessa, the staff of the Yavsk Committee rigidly detained a man in the middle of a crowded street. The videoads, removed by eyewitnesses, show how the man overthrown on the asphalt tries to resist, but people in camouflage form his hands and feet in the camouflage form to bring to the van. "</h3>
<p>The South Operational Command condemned incorrect behavioral servicemen and on its official Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OperationalCommandSouth/posts/pfbid0fbueJ9QFtB3b2CpxKAJ4aiwKCnB9vBaLJKbc6SocdhJidDtXdEzJQxiPoUWYZ7EEl">reported</a>that "on the fact of the conflict situation, which occurred on February 14, 2023, during the hours of work of a group of servicemen of one of the shopping center and JV with alerting citizens who are subject to mobilization, in the public place, the military service is conducting a service investigation."</p>
<p>Agree that such a single conflict on the streets does not consider that "violent mobilization is ongoing in Ukraine."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T78-00-00-04-00/povistka-vsu.jpg" />### ** Alert can be awarded anywhere where it is not prohibited</p>
<p>_ “In early January all over Ukraine the" mobilization teams "were intensified, empowered to prescribe to men summons anywhere and any time, and in the case of resistance-forcibly deliver to territorial centers of complete ... addresses. The reason for the mass raids, which was affirmed by the military, was the reluctance of people to open the door to representatives of theamarmia, ”_ - <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2023/03/17/uk_lonist/">asserts</a>One of the conducting propaganda Russian news online publications of Lenta.ru.</p>
<p>However, it does not informs its readers that according to the legislation of Ukraine, the summons can be reached not only at the places of registration or residence(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1_hYb-NWyQ).</p>
<p>Military lawyer Igor Serov noted the Armyinform that there is a clearly defined list of officials who can do so: “give the summons to conscripts, conscripts and reservists, except employees of the Tax Code and JV, may be directors of state bodies, local self -government bodies, heads of enterprises, organizations, organizations, organizations, organizations, organizations ZhEKs. But they must have a state -owned decree of the territorial center of tasotic support. "</p>
<p>In the case when a citizen believes that the delivery of the summons occurs with any violations, for example, it does not specify all personal data or it is filled with colors, it is possible to refuse to sign it. Then, in the presence of the witness, an act of refusal will be drawn up. These mistakes will be made at the Center. A person also has the right to seek the help of lawyabout directly to the CCC and JV.</p>
<p>But we should not forget that we have not only rights but also responsibilities. According to <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/ua/documents/constitution/konstituciya-ukrayini-rozdil-ii">Article65</a>The Constitution of Ukraine "Protection of the Fatherland, Independence of Tatertorial integrity of Ukraine, honoring its state symbols is the obligation of citizens of Ukraine. Citizens serve military service according to the law. "</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Defense Anna Malyar on her Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ganna.maliar/posts/pfbid035vpbSGe1WaVNwQrpypj2eLb24GSv4BMpooCnvYZohAcs1bq2gdvWJbcEZ6eZd9pbl">noted</a>that “after a large -scale invasion of these IPSO is difficult to get into something or to fall on something. Because to frighten the summons after everything we have passed for this year is hard. "</p>

<p>The GUR of the Ministry of Defense confirms the sharp increase in the number of Russian invaders who seek to be captured to save their lives.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Ukrainian State Project "I want to live" in March 2023 more than 3000 appeals were recorded. This is twice as much as the previous monthly indicators, the spokesman of the program for surrendering the Russian military in Polonvitaly Matvienko said.</p>
<p>Ukraine's military intelligence also states the activation of the occupation of the invaders in the Polonbezhnaya on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian counter -offensive operation on Earth has not yet begun, but the effect of the respective already produces results. The choice of a Russian soldier during the war is simple: either death or captivity. However, a series of sudden, unexpected, lightning events are able to change everything.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is reminiscent of regular diversity in camps for wars and other advantages of the Geneva Conventions, but at the same time - the sound of the window.</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T80-00-00-04-00/abetka-vijny-golovna.jpg" />In the premises of the bookstore "Old Lion" in the center of the capital of Ukraine there was a presentation of the book of Yevgeny and Solomiya Stepanenko "Alphabet of War", which is a modernist, writer and executive producer "Radio Culture" Irinawinsk.</p>
<p>The book "Alphabet of War" is a conversation about one of the stories of the Russian-Ukrainian war, namely about the history of father and daughter. The history, outlined in the book, began eight years ago in 2015, when Yevgeny Stepanenkov was with the Russians and their delicacies in eastern Ukraine, and his daughter salted him from the front in peaceful Kiev.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abetka-vijny-01.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T80-00-00-04-00/abetka-vijny-01-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abetka-vijny-02.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T80-00-00-04-00/abetka-vijny-02-150x150.jpg" /></a>In 2014, after the fighting in eastern Ukraine, Yevgeny Stepanenko went to a volunteer in the special purpose unit. He participated in the battles of the Baddonetsk Airport, Mariupol and Debaltsev. He was a spokesman for the Defense Staff. After the injury he suffered, he became one of the founders of the first volume mobile hospital named after M. Pirogov, where he held the post of deputy chief of staff.</p>
<p>The father's correspondence with his daughter became the basis of the book "Alphabet of War".</p>
<p>“I am grateful to the salt that helped me get back from the war mentally. Thanks to her leaves who were included in this book, she was gaining a courage to discuss the topics important and complex for her. It helped me return to normal life of my time, ”Yevgeny Stepanenko recalled during the presentation.</p>
<p>The book is built as an alphabet, where every letter is one of the dimensions of war Tamra around the war. It intertwines the life of a child in a peaceful city and the life of a father in the war. Salt calls Dad to the front, writes SMS and letters, tells about his affairs, school, friends, competitions, dances, pets ...</p>
<p>Even the salts ask children's and childish questions Daddy about the war. How does he live with scratches and sisters there? Are there any children in the war? What eat in the war? Is it possible in the war to trick? Will Dad another after the war? And Dad is simple, and at the same time carefully explains everything in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abetka-vijny-04.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T80-00-00-04-00/abetka-vijny-04-150x150.jpg)</a></p>
<p>“I wrote this book to try to explain, what is the war that it exists, how it is arranged. By February 24, the majority of the population was somewhere in the east. It was not in our context. I wanted to reply at the level of emotional, philosophical as part of our lives, ”Eugene shared.</p>
<p>It was difficult for him to explain to people who did not know what war was. According to him, this war is endless: “It has been a tenth year, and it is possible to compare with some school, which seems to never end. So now. We make an infinity of war in some infinity. While the book was written, we lived in the Minsk agreements. The impression was that this war was suspended. And if it does not develop in such a terrible way as it was February 24, 2022. "</p>
<p>Eugene says that now it has become easier to explain the essence of the war.</p>
<p>“War is such a life in inhumane conditions, it should not be, but it is. It is more difficult to explain that life and in the war continues. Find the words that you can explain the war, a thing that cannot be explained. Everyone of my text was in emotional experiences. This is a book about emotions and the living. I am happy that we have created a book that helps people, ”the author said.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T80-00-00-04-00/abetka-vijny-5.jpg" />Since 2021, Yevgeny Stepanenko has been working in the Balkans as a special correspondent for Ukrainian media, and after the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine helps the forces of Ukraine's defense. He has long determined that “some road has ending, so war. And when it happens, as I wrote: everything will end, because it does not happen differently. The war will end in the way and we will definitely go through this process. "</p>

To make visitors transformed them into works of art.</p>
<p>-Children see this world differently, and in their palms is a real basis, because they turn such terrible military attributes into bright art. From now on, these helmets and sleeves are not a symbol of war, but on the contrary - the mirus and victories, which will soon come to our native land. After all, beauty must overcome evil!- said the CEO of the library Alla Gordienko.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/foto1_sholomy.jpeg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T84-00-00-04-00/foto1_sholomy-150x150.jpeg)</a></p>

<p>To participate in the art performance, young visitor librarians were invited, some of which study at the Stefan Turchak Kyiv Children's School of Arts.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am inspired by the fact that I give a new life of a helmet, and for me the honor of painting, because they were worn by the Ukrainian military. In the beginning, I was difficult to accept the war, but now I began to treat everything more calmly and look less, because I have anyone to protect. That is why I depicted a firebird, which is going on my spikes, just like our warriors,-said the young participant of Barbarian.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/foto3_sholomy.jpeg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T84-00-00-04-00/foto3_sholomy-150x150.jpeg)</a></p>

And the back of the work is adorned by the illustration of the peaceful sky and the sun, because they are dilated that a dreamy peace and victory will soon come on our earth.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/foto6_sholomy.jpeg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T84-00-00-04-00/foto6_sholomy-150x150.jpeg" /></a>Library staff, who also joined the drawing, chose themselves to work Maria Priymachenko. Therefore, some helmets are decorated with recognizable man's beasts of the famous Ukrainian artist.</p>
<ul>
<li>I came here first and foremost to help children, but art helps you to feel attention and direct excess emotions into creativity. I am from Kherson myself, so I put a particular meaning in this action, because I believe that even on ruins can be done art if you make efforts. And I hope that in the future we can return to my native Kherson his grandeur and beauty, - said the library Anastasia.</li>
</ul>
<p>A special place in the art space of the library is the installation in memory of the prostatement of children who were victims of the consequences of Russia's armed aggression. The souls are presented in the form of paper angels, which are observed.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are guilty of them that we were unable to protect from the terrible fate and give a happy childhood. These kids will no longer be able to read the book, play a played game and hug their parents. That is why we are constantly bringing our young audiences that they have to appreciate every moment of life ... - - note Lyudmila Batsay, the general director of the Library of Ukraine for Children.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T84-00-00-04-00/foto7_sholomy.jpeg" />Some of the painted helmets and sleeves will be handed over to the defenders to the front and units of military units for the design of traditions. The other part of the organizers plan to be implemented at a charity auction to help buy new equipment and ammunition for the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T86-00-00-04-00/golovna-4-1.jpg" />During the official visit of Vladimir Zelensky to Poland was <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/news/prezident-ukrayini-ta-premyer-ministr-polshi-u-varshavi-pidp-82113">signed</a>Letter on the intentions of cooperation on the supply of defense equipment. In particular, it was about acquisition <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/04/06/polskyj-bronetransporter-rosomak-otrymuye-nove-zhyttya-z-bashtoyu-zssw-30/">APC <strong> ROSOMAK </strong></a>, self-propelled mortars <strong> rak </strong> and missiles to portable anti-aircraft missile complexes <strong> Piorun </strong>. The number of weapons has specified <a href="https://twitter.com/michaldworczyk/status/1643656380757204992">on yourTwitter</a>Prime Minister's Office Head Michal Dvochik: _ "Ukraine purchases the Vvoles 150 APC Rosomak, 3 modules of self-propelled mortars RAK, 100_ <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/02/02/use-shho-vam-potribno-znaty-pro-pzrk-perun-onovlenogo-boga-gromu-dlya-zsu-vid-polshhi/"><em>PZRKPIORUN</em></a><em> ”.</em></p>
<p>However, in the media space, information about the number of mortars RAK was understood in different ways: "Ukraine will buy 3 mortars RAK", "The Armed Forces will receive 24 cars". Some reported about the number of "over 50 cars" ... The ArmyInform correspondent has figured out in this matter: 3, 24, 54 - all figures are correct, but need clarification.</p>
<h3><strong> Three Rak Rak modules are 24 self -propelled mortars </strong></h3>
<p>The originality of the configuration of self -propelled mortars <strong> rak </strong> is that the auxiliary masters are more than self -propelled mortars. Yes, indeed, Ukraine will receive three rannyodules. But for eight self -propelled mortars of one module are added four -core machines, three transport for transportation of mines and other equipment, as well as two reconnaissance and one repair!That is, 10 more auxiliary machines are added to the eight -footed machines in the mouth module. So a typical module <strong> rak </strong> consists of 18 cars.</p>
<p>However, if you count only self -propelled mortars, then for three modules they are indeed24, and in total Ukraine will receive 54 cars that are included in three route modules.</p>

<li>They cannot be compared at all. It is a qualitatively better weapon, a completely different generation, with a modern fire management system, - the expert said.</li>

Крім того, є високоточна міна APR 120 від компаніїMesko, яка має напівлазерне наведення.</p>

<p><em>Proect is organized by the National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service(Overnight)Together with the EF Language Learning Solutions.</em> Eduse</p>
<p><em>Armiyinform decided to find out a little more about this project and how it was joined by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine(MOU).</em></p>
<p>Вивчення англійської мови на платформі EF передбачає доступ до відповідногоресурсу з різних девайсів та самостійний вибір темпу навчання.</p>
<p>Навчальні модулі адаптовані під українські реалії й передбачають вивченняграматики, аудіювання, читання та тренування розмовних навичок.</p>
<p>Начальник відділу оцінювання та розвитку персоналу управління з питань роботиз держслужбовцями та керівниками державних підприємств Департаменту кадровоїполітики МОУ Вікторія Дівак розповіла, що нині на Порталі управління знаннямизареєстровано переважну більшість держслужбовців апарату Міністерства оборонита органів військового управління, підпорядкованих Міноборони, держслужбовцівГенерального штабу.</p>

<p>According to Victoria Divak, before the beginning of the educational process, a person needs to pass a half -hour test.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is developed by EF Language Learning Solutions and has to determine the knowledge of a civil servant: from Elementary to Advanced. If a person has a level of ementary, then after his passage can go to a higher module. That is, if a person has time and opportunity, then it would pass, for example, from level A1 to C1. According to the reviews that I hear from people who have already joined the training, the course is interesting and useful for personal development, - said the representative of the Department of Personnel Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the letter of NADS, the Department of Personnel Policy of the Ministry of Defense has determined a specialist who is currently performing the function of the administrator and provides accesso platform to civil servants who want to study English.Irina Yanyshpilsk, who is currently undergoing EF Languagelearning Solutions platform, said that civil servants have the opportunity to improve their English language knowledge even from the initial level.</p>

<ul>
<li>The course is very convenient. Even in your spare time, you go to your personal account on your personal office on the knowledge management portal, you have passed modules, and you study. Accordingly, civil servants can study any corner of Ukraine. For example, I study at the average level of English in my spare time. The course itself is made interesting, informative and versatile.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T90-00-00-04-00/golovna-6-1.jpg" />In the space of the exhibition "Ukraine - Crucifixion" of the National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War, the memory of Denis Artyukhov took place, at the pseudo "Dan", a senior soldier of a separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Vladimramyamoomach of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who died on April 7, 2022.</p>
<p>Denis was born in Donetsk region in Gorlovka. He graduated from Gorlov's Higher Professional College No. 37. In a peaceful life he loved to meet with friends Taribal. From 2015 to the last breath, he defended his native land by the Uvations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The brothers knew his position: he became a volunteer to return to his dear. He was condemned to the countrymen who succumbed to Russian propaganda. His last post on Facebook is Goldda's quote Meir: "There is no way about peace with those who came to kill you."</p>

This museum is a landmark for our family. Denis from the opening of the exposition of a lane in eastern Ukraine often came here and looked at the exhibits for a long time. For a long time he stopped at the locations. And always went upset. And from today, the museum's recipients have the opportunity to look at his things, and the museum workers will talk about him, ”Alla Borovy said, sister Denisaaratyukhov.</p>

<p>The person involved before the start of a full -scale invasion was part of a pool of public pseudo experts who worked for Medvedchuk, Murayev and Sharia.</p>
<p>Lazarev himself was directly engaged in "unbuttoning" of media images of the Khreml's associates and helped them in promoting enemy narratives in information space.</p>
<p>For this purpose he was a frequent "guest" on the airfare of the sub -channels "Our", "ZIK", "NewsOne", "112" and "Russia today".</p>
<p>In his comments, he repeatedly justified Moscow's aggressive policies in the East of Ukraine by the Civil War.</p>
<p>However, after February 24 last year, Lazarev hidden abroad.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he arrived in the occupied Crimea and joined Aksyonov's closest point, which helps in holding hostile information campaign.</p>
<p>On the basis of the evidence collected, investigators of the security services informed the defendant in the treason, as well as violations of equality of citizens depending on their racial, national, regional affiliation, religious beliefs, disability and other grounds.</p>
<p>Complex measures are ongoing to hold it.</p>
<p>The investigation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Kyiv Regional Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T92-00-00-04-00/foto-1.jpeg" />She told this during <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=613272354172103&amp;set=pb.100064680309537.-2207520000.">discussion</a>On the topic "Changing the demographic situation in the country: forecasts and challenges for the state", the First Deputy Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine Darius Marchak. The participants of the event discussed the challenges of the demographic crisis caused by the war of the cross -spheres of the life of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>The demographic crisis has a significant impact on the social sphere. The first challenge is the outreach of Ukrainian citizens abroad. Due to the decrease in the number of people in the country, the number of taxpayers is reduced. For example, the number of those who work that pay the ESA(Without the military), decreased by 25 %.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a large -scale internal migration, which is the second call of the demographic crisis. 4.8 million internally displaced persons have already been registered.</p>
<ul>
<li>I emphasize that not all IDPs are recorded, and this is a separate problem. About 1.1 million citizens have been replaced from the landing, that is, the reconciliation moved from the ORDLO territory, and after a large-scale invasion of the overcomes again. More than 1 million IDPs are children. A total of 3.5 million - passed since February 24, 2022, and 4.8 million, taking into account IDPs since 2014, ”Dariya Marchak reported.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T92-00-00-04-00/foto-2-3.jpg" />Much IDPs will not be able to return home. According to the World Bank, the damage and losses caused by war, nearly half a million units of housing in Ukraine have been completely destroyed, almost a million units of housing have been damaged. Social support of such citizens occurs through a payout program(2000 UAH of the registered IDP and 3000 UAH per child).</p>
<p>— Крім того, відбувається тиск на спроможність системи соціального захистунадавати необхідний обсяг послуг у всіх громадах, куди переїжджають такі люди.Оскільки необхідні додаткові місця в дитячих садках, школах, закладах охорониздоров’я, виникає додаткове навантаження на соціальних працівників, і ми неможемо спрогнозувати станом на сьогодні, який обсяг інфраструктури потрібно вдовгостроковій перспективі будувати в цих громадах. Не відомо, скільки з ВПОповернуться додому, а скільки назавжди залишаться в цій громаді, — пояснилаперший заступник міністра соціальної політики України.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T92-00-00-04-00/foto-3-2-1-e1680888448329.jpg" />The third significant challenge is the increase in the number of citizens who are poverty.Another line of negative impact of demographic changes on the social protection system is the rapid disability of society. According to the Pension Fund system, which registers the payments of disability pensions, during 2022, 13 thousand people began to receive a disability pension.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not have a complete picture in this area, but we understand that the numbers are large -scale. This is a big systemic risk for the country, because if you do not quickly help these citizens, we get a potentially new cohort - Vladory Mchak.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next systemic negative impact of the war is an increase in the number of children who have been lost by one or both parents. At the same time, according to the officials, there is a sharp suspension of the pace of deinstitutionalization of the system of institutions. However, the priority of social policy remains to provide children in families, including the development of family -type orphanages. Was greatly disturbed this trend, and this is an additional risk, which depends on how much this child will grow, how socialized it will be, or will have good education and subsequently its own sources of income. .</p>
<p>*!</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of the number of citizens working(According to the World Bank, 19 % of those who have left the country are not planned to return home); * 2 million citizens were forcibly deported to the aggressor country, and there is also a risk that they would not be able to return home; * 1.5 million jobs can be completely lost; * Increasing the number of those entitled to early retirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> At the same time, the number of persons who will be entitled to permanent payments from the state and early retirement will increase: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Persons who have lost a breadwinner * persons who have received a disability * all who have UBD status(will retire at the age of 50-55).</li>
</ul>
<p>У зв’язку з цим серед пріоритетів соціальної підтримки Дарія Марчак назваланадання соціальних послуг. Це означає, що кожна людина, яка потребуєпідтримки, має знати телефон або місцеперебування кейс-менеджера, якийпідкаже, як розв’язати проблему.</p>

<p>Today, the Cabinet has approved a state policy strategy on internal disperse for the period up to 2025. The appropriate operating plan for 2023-2025 was also approved.</p>
<p>The document was developed by the Ministry of Reintegration with the support of the Council of Europe. Experts of international and non -governmental organizations, which are in charge of the protection of the rights of internally displaced persons, also joined it.</p>
<p>The adoption of a new strategy is the response of the state to the challenges of the massive population of the population caused by full -scale aggression of the Russian Federation. It provides for the state support of IDPs at all stages - from evacuation, in the process of social adaptation in a new place to the time of return to the place of permanent residence.</p>
<p>Thus, the state will focus on 5 strategic purposes: 1 . Response of the state to the challenges of internal movement. 2 . The safe evacuation of citizens from dangerous areas and meeting their humanitarian needs. 3 . IDP adaptation at a new place of residence. 4 . Integration and development of IDPs in host territorial communities. 5 . Support for a safe return to an abandoned residence of a tareintegration.</p>
<p>"State internal movement policy should be comprehensive. The focus of attention should focus on adaptations and further integration internally displaced persons in host communities. These are access to educational services, employment, and support for self -employment. An important component of being professional psychological assistance. I thank the Council of Europe and the public organizations that have joined the strategy development. From now on, we have a clear way to respond to the challenges of internal movement, ”-said Irina Vereshchuk stressed.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-07T96-00-00-04-00/bez-imeni-1.png" />We will not forget that it was from the occupation of the Ukrainian Crimea, from the repression in the Crimean Freedom of Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar, that the attempt of Russia to put Ukraine and other peoples of Europe in slave conditions was against the Crimean Muslim conditions. Humiliation, repression, murder, war ...</p>
<p>But where the path of evil began, it is there that we are waiting for us and victory over it. Deconing Crimea is non -alternative not only for Ukraine but also for the world. For an order in the world based on the UN Conventions and the Charter, not the dimensional habits of murderers, rapists and robbers that Russia is trying to resolve.</p>
<p>I believe that prayers for peace for all our land will be heard without exception. We will return to Crimea - and then the world will return to the union, because the aggressor loses. The victory of Ukraine will mean the victory of life - the lives of Ukrainians of all denominations, of different origins, but with one dream and faith: is the general in good.</p>
<p>He said this in front of Eftaur, who was honored to divide with our warriors, also with representatives of the Majlis, the Crimean Tatar people and the dips corpuslim countries.</p>
<p>Despite the sadness and pain of war, let the sacred Ramadan be bright!</p>
