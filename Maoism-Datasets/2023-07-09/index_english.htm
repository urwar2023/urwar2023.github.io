<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T46-00-00-04-00/golovna-.jpeg" />Ukraine stands firmly and steadfastly, Ukrainian society believes in the Armed Forces, which is liberated temporarily occupied territories, and international support for Ukrainians and unconditional support. Instead, Russia not only did not reach any of the assaults, but also critically undermined its military and economic potential, has finally turned into a label state in the international arena of the Tavista Dictatorship, whose regime has recently demonstrated the world.</p>
<p>These are the main results as of 500 days of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine. There were millions of examples of the courage of icheroism so that not only the world would not only believe in Ukraine, but above all, the Ukrainians themselves were convinced of their own strength and stability. The bloody war finally lifted the Poland of Russian propaganda, as arrogant as it is a misconception, not only the world, but also the Russians themselves.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-08T46-00-00-04-00/vtraty-rf-100-scaled.jpg" />It turned out that modest and unimaginable, at first glance, Ukraine is a full-fledged state, able to withstand and withstand the most extreme crash test from all possible-the test of the Great War. Despite all the extraordinary difficulties, the Ukrainian state has proven that it is vital due to the fact that it is relieved by a drink of mature and responsible civil society, ready -made statin protection of the country as the most valuable of its property and the key to respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Whereas the acquired Russia, with its arrogance and high self -esteem, with a cordial superficial position in the international arena finally finally performed its rotten inside. At the end of the Sixteenth Monthly, it clearly proved not only the usual already human -hate policy, but also the helplessness of the Russian state apparatus and the army, which is incapable of resolving the obvious threat of a military rebellion.</p>

<p>The Russian invaders of Ukraine are even greater on the eve of 500 days of the war. The heavy but unspo than the Ukrainian offensive continues, its inhabited indicators are not only new released territories, but the losses that have grown significantly during May - early July. Particular attention should be paid to the total extermination of enemy artsystems - practically a day Russian invaders lose several several or several dozen -artillery.</p>
<p>June 2023 became a hot moon, during which the enemy lost more than 650 artes. The hottest was the day from June 22 to June 23, when the Armed Forces destroyed 44 units of enemy artillery. If you also add losses here for the end of April - grass, as well as in the first days of July, you can see that more than a quarter of the beginning from the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russian artillery is more than two months. This testifies to the high efficiency of the Counter -battering of the Armed Forces and gradually changes the artillery potential in favor of the Ukrainian army. Where the Russians take exclusively the number, Ukrainian artillerymen are significantly benefit from quality, the accuracy of fire damage.</p>
<p>Equally important are the losses of enemy auto -engineering and air defense. Authorities with hostile losses of living power, tanks, combat armored machinery in May - the beginning of July 2023, this testifies to the success of the Ukrainian offensive. It has already been manifested in the form of a large territory and a number of settlements, with the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was possible to liberate the area of Ukrainian land, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In general, the area of the de -cupovated as of 500 daytreads was practically equal to part of the Ukrainian territory, captured by the state of February 24, 2022.</p>

Instead, as a result of the loss for the Russian army of war and domesticity, the very existence of the Putin regime was threatened.</p>

<p>The necessary set of weapons systems from Western partners is almost inadvertent. Minister of Defense Alexei Reznikov said this on the air of the only news. In particular, according to him, Ukraine is still awaiting the tanks of Abrams.</p>
<ul>
<li>The necessary set of systems almost happened, but not yet finally. The preparation of crews will be done, something else will come. For example, the same Abrams, it was honestly told by our American partners, which they would be in early autumn and end of summer. There are basic things, but the licarters began to check their warehouses, it turned out that what we were promised, it is also not in perfect technical condition. Many countries, special European countries, lived in the paradigm of peaceful, peaceful time that the war is not in the door. And so in many countries, on the contrary, there was a reduction in the arms, reducing stocks in warehouses and freezing orders for the manufacture of means of destruction for the needs of their armed forces. It seemed to everyone that the post -year of the World War, a full -scale, open -scale fighting theater in Europe could happen. But it happened and that is why they also reconstruct it. Now I see, I hear it, I feel, I communicate with the defense ministers, I am directly involved with manufacturers, powerful companies and they all have now got a squeeze to order. Therefore, we will expect that they will continue to be as many as needed, ”the minister said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alexei Reznikov also said that Western partners systematically supply guns of ammunition to Ukraine and finance their industry for the production of additional units, ammunition, ammunition, various types of weapons and spare parts of the Language equipment.</p>
<p>-For example, the European Union project for a million 155 mm shells is already in full on the march. The factories have received orders and accordingly the order has already received the allocated funding of our European partners, - the reporting department of the defense department.</p>

<p>Specialists of the American Nuclear Society(ANS)Carefully analyzed the "worst scenarios" that can occur at the Zaporozhye NPP. About it <a href="https://t.me/energoatom_ua/13872">reports</a>Official Telegram-channelnergoatom of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In particular, the situation with the bombing of the station, intentional subordination of reactors and containers to store the waste fuel was analyzed.</p>
<p>According to experts, none of the analyzed "worst scenarios" is unable to cause radiological danger to the population.</p>
<p>This is due to several factors:</p>
<p>First, six reactors were stopped more than 10 months ago and not produce enough heat to cause a rapid radiation emission.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is designed in such a way as to resist natural and technogenic dumps: the thick-fitted steel concrete shell reliably protects the active zones of reactors from the environment.</p>
<p>In this regard, as experts point out, any potential ejectioactive materials will be limited to the direct zone surrounding the reactors. Therefore, comparisons with Chernobyl or Fukushima are "inaccurate" Itak, which "misleads."</p>

<p>On the live broadcast of the "Uniform News", the spokesman for the Air Force Colonel Yuriy Ignat spoke about the current situation in the sky of Ukraine, as well as how the territory of our country from the enemy's air -dactois is covered today and how the air defense system can change in the near future.</p>
<p>-In relation to this night, everyone was probably noticed by our telegram channel: the tsbul is one of those rare nights when complete silence prevailed,-says Yurignat. - Of course, as always, there is some activity of hostility, but they have not performed combat work. As of now, there are several enemy tactical aircraft aircraft: Su-34 and SU-35, and also Il-22 plane. They perform flights, including the occupied territory and water area of the Azov Sea.</p>

<p>Colonel Yuri Ignat also answered the questions of the leading Telelorphone about what changes will be made about the cover from the air attacks by the Grand Distinist of Ukraine. The head of the public relations service of the Air Forces Command has explained that today the above military leadership of the state has been the most effective and most effective way of air cover. Millionic cities that have strategically important objects-all this is covered by anti-aircraft missile systems of Air Force. The rest of the country, according to Colonel Yuri Ignat, should be buzzing with aviation - hostile missiles should be intercepted by planes.</p>
<p>-The F-16 can take off from our airfields and intercept the goals over the entire territory of Ukraine,-the officer explains. -Ideally, at our borders. In addition, planes can control the airspace not only of Ukraine's adherence but also in the Black Sea, including to effectively act on enemy carbon rockets "Caliber".</p>
<p>The only thing, according to Yuri Ignatus, why aircraft cannot resist - brush weapons. But these tasks are solved by the modern Western anti-aircraft-rocket complexes of Patriot and SAMP-T, which are in service with domestic airborne air. The rest of the hostile rockets and shock drones should be destroyed by aviation. In particular, by acting on the carriers of this weapon before its use.</p>

That's when it will be clear to the population, they will not see them, stand in line, suffer in the wandering. We need to change the approach, we need to cancel the conscription, make a professional army, but to make a clear -scale register of a reserve in case of a full -scale war, in case of shutdown. This means that our main capital is people and we need to work with them, - said the Minister of Defense.</li>

<p>This assumption was made by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-abc-russia-ukraine-war-end-thoughts-us/story?id=100903255">ABC News</a>, reports Ukrinform with reference to <a href="https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-zelenskyy-putin-krym-rosiya-perehovory/32495776.html">"Radio Liberty"</a>.</p>
<p>Answering the question whether it is possible to force Putin to go to the intervals, the President of Ukraine said it was a completely logical assumption.</p>
<p>“Well, it is absolutely understandable, logical rhetoric that at the moment when the Ukrainian administrative border with a temporarily occupied Crimea is very likely that Putin will be forced to look for a dialogue with the civilized world, towards how it was to a full -scale invasion will be weakened, ” - said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zelenskij">Zelensky</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-09T93-00-00-04-00/7-chernyk.jpg" />Military expert Petro Chernyk</p>
<p>Casette ammunition will become very noticeable for our defenders during the combatants, as well as in the process of demining the territories tightly replaced by Russian occupants, the military analyst Colonel Petro Chernik.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news."</p>
<p>-Cassette ammunition, it is such a weapon that has in its body, and is referred to a minimum of 72 elements, each element weighs 200 grams, and when the projectile enters the combat trajectory, undermines at an altitude of 15-20 meters, each element. It is more than the football field, sowing with this, - says the officer. - Why is this extremely important? Imagine that this football field, and if it is a forest strip - there are several pieces of equipment. They are very seriously disguised, and it will be very difficult to hunt them with a regular projectile. And this is especially true of the extermination of the power that is hidden in the trench of the armor, because these small elements are very convenient there. Thus, this arms is intended to raise the coefficient of lesions of living force, and most importantly - to harm the technique.</p>
<p>According to a military scientist, we are well aware that such an element can not be a tank, but it can damage it. And if the enemy does not export the enemy with the field, then the damaged motorcycle is spent on the damaged, and even more of the power. Therefore, these ammunition is designed to raise the level of destruction and equipment and living power as much as possible.</p>
<p>-Well, finally, they came to a symmetrical answer: the enemy for a very long time, especially in the equipment BM-21 "Grad", uses such ammunition-the statement of political sciences Petro Chernik.</p>
<p>As for the danger of non -break cassettes, for other soldiers who can theoretically blow out on them, capturing the enemy, for comparison, Colonel Petro Chernik cites the percentage of Russian and American ammunition of this type. In Russian it is 30, and in some places it reaches 40%, in US - a maximum of 1.5%, a part -time case - 3%.</p>
<p>The military expert also answered the question of the leading spoken studio maternity studio on the possibility of using cassette ammunition to displace the minefields installed by the enemy on a temporarily occupying territory.Also, according to the expert, there are heavy demining machines on the basis of a tank that have a heavy working body made from superhard alloys of metal, titanium, tungsten, and which are massively digging mines, while some of them are disrupted, some are not broken. But again, for the use of such technology, you need to push the enemy and its firearms as far as possible.</p>

<p>This is the edition <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/07/08/ukraine-nato-bid-block-germany-fears-putin/">The Telegraph</a>With reference NATOVERL to NATO, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>Like, Berlin will use the NATO Summit in Vilnius to urge others to stand on safety guarantees, not on membership proposals to help Ukraine protect itself without entering the Alliance.</p>
<p>“Berlin is restrained in the prospect of immediate membership. He needs a process and time to develop guarantees by actually blocking membership. Berlin wants to see Vladimir Putin potentially tested article 5, ”the source reported.</p>

<p>The concern of Germany seems to be shared by US President Joe Biden, who was wanting to avoid the situation when "we are all in the war, we are in the war with Russia." It will take some time ”and his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said:“ We will not start the Third World War. Ukraine will not join NATO after this summit. "</p>
<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky gradually launched his campaign to connect the state to NATO, writes the author. The leader of the warring state called on the 31 NATO member member to take specific steps on Ukraine's membership so that his country could quickly join the Transatlantic Alliance after the war.</p>
<p>Germany and the United States have privately warned that this step could be a transformative conflict into an active war between NATO and Russia.</p>

<p>President Zelensky stated that he would not only come with a summit if there are specific bonds of partners.</p>
<p>According to him, the statements signed by NATO in Bucharest in 2008, which said that the "door was open" to Kiev is not enough.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary -General, has already excluded the official invitation of Pivit, since the unanimous consent of the 31 member is required to expand the Alliance. Currently, only 23 countries have signed a statement with Ukraine jointly support the Alliance.</p>
