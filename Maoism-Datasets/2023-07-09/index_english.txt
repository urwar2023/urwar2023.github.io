 Ukraine stands firmly and steadfastly, Ukrainian society believes in the Armed Forces, which is liberated temporarily occupied territories, and international support for Ukrainians and unconditional support. Instead, Russia not only did not reach any of the assaults, but also critically undermined its military and economic potential, has finally turned into a label state in the international arena of the Tavista Dictatorship, whose regime has recently demonstrated the world.
These are the main results as of 500 days of the large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine. There were millions of examples of the courage of icheroism so that not only the world would not only believe in Ukraine, but above all, the Ukrainians themselves were convinced of their own strength and stability. The bloody war finally lifted the Poland of Russian propaganda, as arrogant as it is a misconception, not only the world, but also the Russians themselves.
 It turned out that modest and unimaginable, at first glance, Ukraine is a full-fledged state, able to withstand and withstand the most extreme crash test from all possible-the test of the Great War. Despite all the extraordinary difficulties, the Ukrainian state has proven that it is vital due to the fact that it is relieved by a drink of mature and responsible civil society, ready -made statin protection of the country as the most valuable of its property and the key to respect for human rights.
Whereas the acquired Russia, with its arrogance and high self -esteem, with a cordial superficial position in the international arena finally finally performed its rotten inside. At the end of the Sixteenth Monthly, it clearly proved not only the usual already human -hate policy, but also the helplessness of the Russian state apparatus and the army, which is incapable of resolving the obvious threat of a military rebellion.
 Deookupopovanka of the territory of Ukraine, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)
The Russian invaders of Ukraine are even greater on the eve of 500 days of the war. The heavy but unspo than the Ukrainian offensive continues, its inhabited indicators are not only new released territories, but the losses that have grown significantly during May - early July. Particular attention should be paid to the total extermination of enemy artsystems - practically a day Russian invaders lose several several or several dozen -artillery.
June 2023 became a hot moon, during which the enemy lost more than 650 artes. The hottest was the day from June 22 to June 23, when the Armed Forces destroyed 44 units of enemy artillery. If you also add losses here for the end of April - grass, as well as in the first days of July, you can see that more than a quarter of the beginning from the beginning of a large -scale invasion of Russian artillery is more than two months. This testifies to the high efficiency of the Counter -battering of the Armed Forces and gradually changes the artillery potential in favor of the Ukrainian army. Where the Russians take exclusively the number, Ukrainian artillerymen are significantly benefit from quality, the accuracy of fire damage.
Equally important are the losses of enemy auto -engineering and air defense. Authorities with hostile losses of living power, tanks, combat armored machinery in May - the beginning of July 2023, this testifies to the success of the Ukrainian offensive. It has already been manifested in the form of a large territory and a number of settlements, with the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was possible to liberate the area of Ukrainian land, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. In general, the area of the de -cupovated as of 500 daytreads was practically equal to part of the Ukrainian territory, captured by the state of February 24, 2022.
 Controller(Screenshot from an interactive online card https://deepstatemap.live)As of the 500th day of the war, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have a strategic initiative and confidently occur, causing the enemy of critical losses. Instead, as a result of the loss for the Russian army of war and domesticity, the very existence of the Putin regime was threatened.
Let's keep the line!

Specialists of the American Nuclear Society(ANS)Carefully analyzed the "worst scenarios" that can occur at the Zaporozhye NPP. About it reports Official Telegram-channelnergoatom of Ukraine.
In particular, the situation with the bombing of the station, intentional subordination of reactors and containers to store the waste fuel was analyzed.
According to experts, none of the analyzed "worst scenarios" is unable to cause radiological danger to the population.
This is due to several factors:
First, six reactors were stopped more than 10 months ago and not produce enough heat to cause a rapid radiation emission.
Secondly, it is designed in such a way as to resist natural and technogenic dumps: the thick-fitted steel concrete shell reliably protects the active zones of reactors from the environment.
In this regard, as experts point out, any potential ejectioactive materials will be limited to the direct zone surrounding the reactors. Therefore, comparisons with Chernobyl or Fukushima are "inaccurate" Itak, which "misleads."

The head of the public relations service of the Air Forces Command has explained that today the above military leadership of the state has been the most effective and most effective way of air cover. Millionic cities that have strategically important objects-all this is covered by anti-aircraft missile systems of Air Force. The rest of the country, according to Colonel Yuri Ignat, should be buzzing with aviation - hostile missiles should be intercepted by planes.
-The F-16 can take off from our airfields and intercept the goals over the entire territory of Ukraine,-the officer explains. -Ideally, at our borders. In addition, planes can control the airspace not only of Ukraine's adherence but also in the Black Sea, including to effectively act on enemy carbon rockets "Caliber".
The only thing, according to Yuri Ignatus, why aircraft cannot resist - brush weapons. But these tasks are solved by the modern Western anti-aircraft-rocket complexes of Patriot and SAMP-T, which are in service with domestic airborne air. The rest of the hostile rockets and shock drones should be destroyed by aviation. In particular, by acting on the carriers of this weapon before its use.

 Military expert Petro Chernyk
Casette ammunition will become very noticeable for our defenders during the combatants, as well as in the process of demining the territories tightly replaced by Russian occupants, the military analyst Colonel Petro Chernik.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA)"The only news."
-Cassette ammunition, it is such a weapon that has in its body, and is referred to a minimum of 72 elements, each element weighs 200 grams, and when the projectile enters the combat trajectory, undermines at an altitude of 15-20 meters, each element. It is more than the football field, sowing with this, - says the officer. - Why is this extremely important? Imagine that this football field, and if it is a forest strip - there are several pieces of equipment. They are very seriously disguised, and it will be very difficult to hunt them with a regular projectile. And this is especially true of the extermination of the power that is hidden in the trench of the armor, because these small elements are very convenient there. Thus, this arms is intended to raise the coefficient of lesions of living force, and most importantly - to harm the technique.
According to a military scientist, we are well aware that such an element can not be a tank, but it can damage it. And if the enemy does not export the enemy with the field, then the damaged motorcycle is spent on the damaged, and even more of the power. Therefore, these ammunition is designed to raise the level of destruction and equipment and living power as much as possible.
-Well, finally, they came to a symmetrical answer: the enemy for a very long time, especially in the equipment BM-21 "Grad", uses such ammunition-the statement of political sciences Petro Chernik.
As for the danger of non -break cassettes, for other soldiers who can theoretically blow out on them, capturing the enemy, for comparison, Colonel Petro Chernik cites the percentage of Russian and American ammunition of this type. In Russian it is 30, and in some places it reaches 40%, in US - a maximum of 1.5%, a part -time case - 3%.
The military expert also answered the question of the leading spoken studio maternity studio on the possibility of using cassette ammunition to displace the minefields installed by the enemy on a temporarily occupying territory.Also, according to the expert, there are heavy demining machines on the basis of a tank that have a heavy working body made from superhard alloys of metal, titanium, tungsten, and which are massively digging mines, while some of them are disrupted, some are not broken. But again, for the use of such technology, you need to push the enemy and its firearms as far as possible.
