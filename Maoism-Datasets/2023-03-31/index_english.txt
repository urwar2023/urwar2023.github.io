 About it tells Center for Combating Misinformation at NSDC Ukraine.
For many years, Russia has portrayed children as victims who have spent the idea. From the time of the formation of Soviet power, the hero of propaganda has become a caretaker Pavlik Morozov, who issued his father's Chekists and was killed by his own birth. Later, the minor guerrillas of World War II, which were spying, pasted cartoons on the Nazis, collecting weapons of camps, and sometimes killed the Nazis. The main rule of the Soviet agit industry was the fact of "heroic death" of toddlers, which made it possible to create them with a necessary biography and ideologically substantiate their "feats".
A new stage of canonization of "hero boys" has unfolded with the beginning of the events of 2014 in the Donbass. With the help of candid fakes about the "atrocities of the Nazis", Rospropaganda solved a real information war on dehumanization of Ukrainian. The most famous fake of the time was the story about the "crucified boy" in Slavyansk, whom the Ukrainian military was allegedly executed in his eyes in his mother and residents of the city. The propaganda lie was so obvious that the Russian media were forced to recognize the fake of the plot, and the "crucified boy" immediately became an Internet meme and a smile for the whole world. After that, Russia has repeatedly spread fakes about "Donbass Children", which Ukraine seems to be killed.
But with the beginning of a full-scale war, the image of "child-victim" has turned a "child-hero" child
Thus, in the spring of 2022, the hero of publications of the most popular Russian news media was the boy "Alyoshka", a resident of the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation, who ran along the route in a helmet and greeted the armored vehicles, which went towards the border of Zavraina.However, the boy in Russia began to heroes and turn into a new symbol of propaganda. Putin awarded him with the Medal for Courage, postcards with the inscription "Fedya - the Hero of Russia" appeared on the fences of the Umbryansk region. Alessum's "feat" circumstances swept through Russia, they even joke there, every other than a baby who survived after the crucifixion of Ukrainian "Nazis".
Such examples are only part of the systemic use of children in the interests of propaganda
Increasingly, boys and girls are becoming direct participants in numerous Z-Symbolism to support the war against Ukraine. In Ukrainian schools, students tell students a Russian version of what is happening in Ukraine, about "special operation heroes", "friends and enemies of Moscow". Young people are involved in the organization "UNarmia", which is overseen by the Ministry of Defense. In the schools of the occupied part of Kherson region, students of 10-11 grades open to join the Russian army.
By the end of 2023, Russia plans to "process" more than 3.3 million Ukrainian children ideologically in the occupied territories.
Why did the Russian Federation renew the trend "Hero boys"? 
First, it is an attempt to transform children into a symbol of Russian Z-Patriotism of the Russian confidence that "war is a revenge for children of Donbass", which justifies the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians.
Secondly, fakes like the "crucified boy" are used as an emotional trigger to generate the Russian of another wave of anger for "crimes of Ukrainian" and consolidation around the common goal of "denacification" and "liberation" of Ukrainian territories.
Third, it is a logical continuation of the Kremlin's policy on the planting of young Russian youth and occupied territories of "correct" behavior, the key element of which is the creation of the enemy's likeness of the enemy. Thus, young people prepare a mobilization reserve or "volunteer battalions" that are formed in Russia.
Manipulations with the use of children as the main characters is a bad attempt by Russian propaganda to evoke emotions and experiences in the audience and create an information background to justify their military crimes in Ukraine.

 Dezhava-Aggressor began to initiate the so-called "humanitarian measures" on its own the works, which announces the participation of Ukrainian officials, including the representatives of the coordination headquarters on the management of prisoners of war.
About it informs Coordination headquarters of prisoners of war.
Information on participation in any eye or correspondence events initiated by the Russian side, representatives of Ukraine is not true. Such anons and statements are intended to discredit Ukrainian officials.
Similar provocations are a form of enemy IPSO. Under the cover of a humane goal, they are really called to duplicate the work of international organizations that the aggressor country does not allow the places of keeping prisoners and civilian hostages, and the deported children.
We urge the Russian side to fulfill the Geneva Conventions, to ensure the refined and complete access of representatives of the International Committee of the Chervonoro -Rrest to the places of detention, not to engage in pseudo -initiatives for the purpose of propaganda.
The work that the coordination headquarters conducts to liberate all our citizens of provocative captivity is carried out in a closed mode and does not involve the participation in this process of unparalleled persons.
The efforts of representatives of the aggressor state to attach Ukrainians to the so-called "humanitarian" measures or missions are only another act of Russian propaganda.

 It is incredibly painful to mention these events. After all, they became a deep wound of every Ukrainian ...
A year ago, we learned about the tragedy in Bucha-the satellite of Kyiv, where we were occupied by mass murder and torture locals. The crimes committed by the servicemen in the Kyiv region became the most severe actomyterity against civilian population in the world, genocide in the most horrifying sense. In words, it is impossible to convey the horror that happened here during the production of the city-torture, rape, hanging, burning alive, dismemberment of bodies ... It is impossible to understand and explain the motives of the squeezed-enemy-notes that committed this sin against humanity. The heart will not be able to test for those who now call themselves Russians, the savagery of their arrivals-military criminals ...

Ukraine uses all opportunities to return our defenders. Tatyanamo -scaly ignores repeated attempts by the ombudsman Dmitry Lubinz, as well as international humanitarian organizations to establish a constructive dialogue, demonstrates the lack of independent behavior and is only a tool of Russian propaganda.
On February 25, this year, the Russian "Obudsman" got to the sanctional listous union for denial of the fact of filtration measures, which was conducted by the aggressor state in the occupied Ukrainian territories.
Russia holds as prisoners of civilian hostages, non -combatants(persons who will be in goodness in the army, but do not participate in hostilities: musicians of military, doctors, chaplains, etc.), as well as seriously ill and wounded defenders and defenders. All of them must be released immediately without any additional conditions.
Last week, Ukraine, without any circumstances, released the seriously wounded, which could be transported. Instead of taking analogic real steps under international humanitarian law, Russia is trying to discredit Ukrainian structures of the exchange organization.
The only positive in such provocations-publishing the lists of enemies mediatedly confirms the stay of Ukrainian citizens in captivity. message.

All this - to accelerate, to make more vigorous global work for the sake of the tribunal aggression of Russia, for the sake of new warrants from the International Criminal Court, the arrest of Russian military criminals, for the sake of legal and fair sentences that all Russian murderers and executioners must obtain.
And they will get. One hundred percent. We will provide it. We find formats, find tools.
I thank everyone who helps us in this. Every state, every leader, every international organization.
Today, representatives of almost fivety countries took part in our First Buchansky Summit. And this is just the beginning.
I thank the leaders of Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia and Moldova, who today visited Ukraine who personally supported Bucha - honored the memory of all who died in the Russian occupation. And of course - I thank our soldiers. All who are fighting for Ukraine now. All who have fought for Ukraine since the 14th. To all whose life literally gives life to Ukraine.
Ukrainians will stand in this war. We will liberate our land and all our people of Edorian captivity. And there will be a day when the world will hear that justice for Ukraine is diverted.
There will be a new Nuremberg - about the racists.
