<p>For many years, Russia has portrayed children as victims who have spent the idea. From the time of the formation of Soviet power, the hero of propaganda has become a caretaker Pavlik Morozov, who issued his father's Chekists and was killed by his own birth. Later, the minor guerrillas of World War II, which were spying, pasted cartoons on the Nazis, collecting weapons of camps, and sometimes killed the Nazis. The main rule of the Soviet agit industry was the fact of "heroic death" of toddlers, which made it possible to create them with a necessary biography and ideologically substantiate their "feats".</p>
<p>A new stage of canonization of "hero boys" has unfolded with the beginning of the events of 2014 in the Donbass. With the help of candid fakes about the "atrocities of the Nazis", Rospropaganda solved a real information war on dehumanization of Ukrainian. The most famous fake of the time was the story about the "crucified boy" in Slavyansk, whom the Ukrainian military was allegedly executed in his eyes in his mother and residents of the city. The propaganda lie was so obvious that the Russian media were forced to recognize the fake of the plot, and the "crucified boy" immediately became an Internet meme and a smile for the whole world. After that, Russia has repeatedly spread fakes about "Donbass Children", which Ukraine seems to be killed.</p>
<p>But with the beginning of a full-scale war, the image of "child-victim" has turned a "child-hero" child</p>
<p>Thus, in the spring of 2022, the hero of publications of the most popular Russian news media was the boy "Alyoshka", a resident of the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation, who ran along the route in a helmet and greeted the armored vehicles, which went towards the border of Zavraina.However, the boy in Russia began to heroes and turn into a new symbol of propaganda. Putin awarded him with the Medal for Courage, postcards with the inscription "Fedya - the Hero of Russia" appeared on the fences of the Umbryansk region. Alessum's "feat" circumstances swept through Russia, they even joke there, every other than a baby who survived after the crucifixion of Ukrainian "Nazis".</p>
<p>Such examples are only part of the systemic use of children in the interests of propaganda</p>
<p>Increasingly, boys and girls are becoming direct participants in numerous Z-Symbolism to support the war against Ukraine. In Ukrainian schools, students tell students a Russian version of what is happening in Ukraine, about "special operation heroes", "friends and enemies of Moscow". Young people are involved in the organization "UNarmia", which is overseen by the Ministry of Defense. In the schools of the occupied part of Kherson region, students of 10-11 grades open to join the Russian army.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, Russia plans to "process" more than 3.3 million Ukrainian children ideologically in the occupied territories.</p>
<p><strong> Why did the Russian Federation renew the trend "Hero boys"? </strong></p>
<p>First, it is an attempt to transform children into a symbol of Russian Z-Patriotism of the Russian confidence that "war is a revenge for children of Donbass", which justifies the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians.</p>
<p>Secondly, fakes like the "crucified boy" are used as an emotional trigger to generate the Russian of another wave of anger for "crimes of Ukrainian" and consolidation around the common goal of "denacification" and "liberation" of Ukrainian territories.</p>
<p>Third, it is a logical continuation of the Kremlin's policy on the planting of young Russian youth and occupied territories of "correct" behavior, the key element of which is the creation of the enemy's likeness of the enemy. Thus, young people prepare a mobilization reserve or "volunteer battalions" that are formed in Russia.</p>
<p>Manipulations with the use of children as the main characters is a bad attempt by Russian propaganda to evoke emotions and experiences in the audience and create an information background to justify their military crimes in Ukraine.</p>

<p>This was stated by Czech President Peter Pavel during the Buchan Summit of Personality on March 31, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“We are all impressed with the barbaric behavior of Russian soldiers. It is not possible to find a clear condemnation than what was stated in the decision of the International Criminal Court. These are crimes with horrible consequences. And they should not be unpunished, ”Pavel said.</p>

<p>The President of the Czech Republic noted that crimes should be persecuted both at national and international cooperation. The Czech leader supports the investigation in Ukraine by the International Criminal Court, as it is the only constant criminal court, and it is "the best suitable for investigating such mass -war crimes as those that took place in Ukraine."</p>
<p>“We have recently seen the first results - the order was issued for arrest. Let's continue to continue to support the ISS in its fight against impunity, ”Paul assured.</p>

<p>He also emphasized that "there is no doubt that under international law she has grown aggression against Ukraine", breaking the UN Statute, and the international community has such violations. But, in addition to the responsibility of the state, the head of the Czech Republic noted the individual criminal liability of Russian leaders for crime, to which the Jurisdiction of the ISS is not extended.</p>
<p>“I hope that this gap will be filled by creating a special brood to properly evaluate the evidence available and prosecute the perpetrators. None of those who committed a crime against peace, a crime of aggression should remain unpunished, ”Pavel said.</p>

<p>All this - to accelerate, to make a more vigorous global work for the sake of the tribunal aggression of Russia, for the sake of new warrants from the International Criminal Court, the arrest of Russian military criminals, for the sake of legal and fair sentences that all Russian killers and executioners have to obtain.</p>
<p>And they will get. One hundred percent. We will provide it. We find formats, find tools.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who helps us in this. Every state, every leader, every international organization.</p>
<p>Today, representatives of almost fivety countries took part in our First Buchansky Summit. And this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I thank the leaders of Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia and Moldova, who today visited Ukraine who personally supported Bucha - honored the memory of all who died in the Russian occupation.</p>
<p>And of course - I thank our soldiers. All who are fighting for Ukraine now. All who have fought for Ukraine since the 14th. To all whose life literally gives life to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainians will stand in this war. We will liberate our land and all our people of Edorian captivity. And there will be a day when the world will hear that justice for Ukraine is diverted.</p>
<p>There will be a new Nuremberg - about the racists.</p>

<p>As a result of such "humanitarian exceptions", in particular, the UN Programs of Taneourated Organizations involved in the implementation of the UN plans for humanitarian reacting, without any preliminary approval, may take some actions by zoations and institutions included in the sanction list, if the purpose of such is the delivery of humanitarian assistance or support of other operations aimed at meeting the basic needs of a person.</p>
<p>As it is noted, today's decision completes the process of applying exceptions to the 14th sanction regimes of the UN, which is reflected in the EU legislation. These exceptions also extend to the Autonomous sanction lists of the EU, which complemented the UN restriction. This creates a clear legal field for market operators, which will be able to use exceptions from sanctions without any differences to the sanction lists of both the UN and the EU.</p>

<p>He stated this during a press conference on the results of the Buchan summit, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“The signal that Russia will place nuclear weapons in Belarus, says an unsuccessful meeting with China. The first thing to show some kind of personality, which, under the management of President Putin, has completely lost. But he could not do it on the battlefield. And even about the fact that they started such a bloody war - it is absolutely clear what it will already become. The question is that he simply does not regret our people and kills, but he does not count his people. But these are the affairs of the Russian Federation, ”Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The President also stressed that Putin's statements show completely loss of any subjectivity and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>"He(Lukashenko - Ed.), I think, no longer decides which weapon is the largest area, "Zelensky added.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Head of State emphasized that Putin is still threatening the world, because if Ukraine does not stand, the Russian dictator will go further to other countries.</p>

We continue to think that it was a right course of action, and we want to thank everyone who supported it. The moment, and the suffering of the people of Ukraine as a result of war in their country is not baked. Tennis or sports problems are relatively minor. However, our year's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players visited to the tournaments has led to significant sanctions imposed on us atp and WTA, including the real perspective of termination of our membership, if we repeatmozaboron in 2023, ”the message reads.</p>
<p>The Association also explained that their position is unchanged at the expense of Ukraine's support.</p>
<p>“Our position to support the people of Ukraine remains unchanged in 2023, as well as our concern that Russian and Belarusian regimes receive reputation and other advantages, trying to associate themselves with players. Moreover, we know that Russian and Belarusian players played neutral athletes last year. Taking these considerations together, we agreed that all Russian and Belarusian players and auxiliary staff who wish to take the event in our events in 2023 will have to sign proneutatti declarations. This corresponds to the instructions of the UK government and is an approach that was used in other sports, ”the Association explained.</p>

<p>This was stated on Friday during the UN Security Council Security Council at the US Deputy Standing Representative at <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon"></a>Robertwood, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“Less than two weeks ago President Putin in a joint statement with(Head - ed.)The CPRZ has an effective way of reducing the risks of nuclear war and cynically claimed that "states with nuclear weapons should maintain such weapons abroad, as well as to bring nuclear weapons, deployed, deployed," the US representative reminded.</p>

<p>Wood also stressed that Putin once again demonstrated the world his neglect of international law, including the UN Charter. “Russia's arguments that it is a potential deployment(nuclear weapons - ed.)Somehow justified because of the use of armored ammunition is funny, ”the US representative said.</p>
<p>However, he said, the reality is that the Kremlin simply does not want Ukraine to have the ability to defend themselves from Russian tanks. In this context, the US representative stressed that Russian tanks did not find themselves in binding if they were not in the sovereign territory of Ukraine.“We urge Russia to revise our intentions for the placement of nuclear weapons of the Vibrativer and again urge the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

<p>This was stated by a permanent representative of Ukraine at the UN Sergey Kislytsa Nazidana of the UN Security Council to discuss the threats of Russian President Vladimirapoutin to place nuclear weapons in Belarus, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin"></a>It took only four days to release another obligation, which he recently assumed with the leader of the PRC, signed on March 22, 2023. The document proclaims that "all states with nuclear weapons must refrain from developing nuclear weapons outside their national territories," - said.</p>
<p>To the honor of the Chinese side, Kyslitsa added, "it is very reasonable to remind the fact that the nuclear war cannot be won and wage and that it is necessary to prevent the distribution of nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>Unlike Russia, China's position on nuclear weapons is solid and clear, postpress stressed.</p>
<p>Kyslytsya reminded that Ukraine is a participant in the Nuclear Arrangement Agreement, and signed in 1994 the Budapest Memorandum on providing security guarantees in connection with the day -to -day accession.</p>
<p>Ukraine has abandoned the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, he emphasized. However, according to Kislytsya, one of the guarantors-Russian Federation-has not fulfilled its obligations on the Budapest Memorandum from the back demonstrates that he perceives nuclear weapons as a tool of threats and intimidation, not a means of deterrent to war.</p>

<p>According to Ukrinform, this is stated in the article of the high representative of the EU, the Vice President of the European Commission Josepa Borrel for the Austrian newspaper <a href="http://www.derstandard.at/story/2000145060987/josep-borrell-europa-ruestet-auf-nicht-nur-fuer-die-ukraine"></a>.</p>
<p>"Russia should be held accountable. This is why the International Criminal Court's Criminal Court is an important: Putin should pay for war crimes for which he is not responsible. Among them, the violent abduction of many children in Ukraine," Borsel wrote.</p>
<p>He stressed that "in this war history and justice - on the side of Ukraine." But we must accelerate the course of history. Our military support and overwhelming to buy ammunition together serve the case representative <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-evrosouz"></a>.</p>
<p>Borrel pointed out that Ukraine needs not only political and financial support, but of all weapons and ammunition to protect itself and release itself and giving the Russian aggressor to protect the Russian aggressor. "The protection of Ukrainian sovereignty is existential in nature - both for Ukraine and for all of Europe. We cannot reach this without giving Ukraine the means to achieve it," he emphasized.</p>
<p>Against this background, the high representative of the EU reminded that last week, European leaders agreed to a proposal of three points for purchases and production and transfer of them and their transfer to Ukraine, as well as replenishment of their own stocks.</p>
<p>"In the last 20 years, Europeans have reduced investments in the defense industry. In connection with the radically changed security environment, we need to increase them again. In particular, we want to put 1 million artillery shells in Ukraine with Ukraine. Peace. In the case of compensation of 50 to 60%, we can mobilize with a nearly 4 billion euros with this new package, "Borrel said.</p>
<p>According to him, it shows that the EU "is able to act quickly when necessary" and that it demonstrates the decisiveness of European countries to give Ukrainian need for its legal self -defense.At the same time, he stressed that the European Union, as in Ukraine, of course, want peace.</p>
<p>"But we do not want any peace. We want a fair and long peace based on the UN Charter. The peace in which Russia will bring its troops from all the Ukrainian districts that it occupies. That is why we also support President Vladimir Zelensky's peaceful formula. In words, it is important how the war will finish, not just what it will end with, with the territorial and other achievements of Russia from this aggressive war, "Borrel added.</p>

<p>He stated this during a press conference on the results of the Buchan summit, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“The signal that Russia will place nuclear weapons in Belarus, says an unsuccessful meeting with China. The first thing to show some kind of personality, which, under the management of President Putin, has completely lost. But he could not do it on the battlefield. And even about the fact that they started such a bloody war - it is absolutely clear what it will already become. The question is that he simply does not regret our people and kills, but he does not count his people. But these are the affairs of the Russian Federation, ”Zelensky said.</p>

<p>The President also stressed that Putin's statements show completely loss of any subjectivity and President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>"He(Lukashenko - Ed.), I think, no longer decides which weapon is the largest area, "Zelensky added.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Head of State emphasized that Putin is still threatening the world, because if Ukraine does not stand, the Russian dictator will go further to other countries.</p>

<p>Видобуток газу на найбільших родовищах західного сибіру впаде на третину до2040 року через виснаження запасів, що легко видобуваються, попередив урядглава міненерго ніколай шульгінов. До 2040 року показник видобутку газу внадим-пур-тазовському регіоні ямало-ненецького автономного округу скоротитьсядо 255 млрд. За даними росстату, 2022 року в росії було видобуто близько 672млрд кубометрів газу.

<p>A year ago, we learned about the tragedy in Bucha-the satellite of Kyiv, where we were occupied by mass murder and torture locals. The crimes committed by the servicemen in the Kyiv region became the most severe actomyterity against civilian population in the world, genocide in the most horrifying sense. In words, it is impossible to convey the horror that happened here during the production of the city-torture, rape, hanging, burning alive, dismemberment of bodies ... It is impossible to understand and explain the motives of the squeezed-enemy-notes that committed this sin against humanity. The heart will not be able to test for those who now call themselves Russians, the savagery of their arrivals-military criminals ...</p>

<p><img alt="" src="ConvertedIMGs/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-03-31T70-00-00-04-00/mbd1qyo.png" />The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets reacted the decision of the International Olympic Committee to recommend international federations to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to international competitions under the neutral flag. At the same time, the IOC reported that they leave the right to decide whether the athletes of the two countries in the 20124 and 2026 Olympics will participate at the relevant time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission to participate in the Olympic Games in neutral status is an attempt to close their eyes to the crimes that Russia commits in the territory of the state - mass murder, theft, deportation, torture, torture, destruction and destruction of civilian and energy infrastructure. Including from the territory of Belarus, - says Ombudsman.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Commissioner, many athletes of the Russian Federation are military army, which kills Ukrainians. From the beginning of a large -scale invasion, 262 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed. Almost 350 sports facilities are arranged or damaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>I personally communicated with the athlete, who was tortured in the occupation by Russian, breaking the bones of hands and feet, so that he could no longer represent Ukraine in the world arenas, - said Dmitry Lubinets.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also noted that a year ago, the IOC supported Ukraine, dismissal and Belarussian athletes from participation in international competitions.</p>
<p>In his address to the International Olympic Committee, the Ombudsman urges to violate the principles of Olympic peace and prohibit the participation of Russian Ibilorus athletes in international competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The criminal actions of Russia are completely contrary to the modern concept of Olympism, the idea of which is the idea of supporting the anti -war movement and reconciliation of peoples. The Russian Federation and Belarus is not a place in the great sport!</li>
