Since 2014, he realized that his calling to be a military chaplain on the front.

- When Oleksandrhokov called at the beginning of a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation and said that help was needed, I did not think about the name of Nazmiin. He lost, apparently, the fear of these racists. I think we are very different from the Russians, because we really love our country, - said Bulgarian.

The abbot of the Odessa Holy Trinity Church of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Vasily Vyrozub Chaplain, whom the raciers did not want to let out of captivity and holding his other brothers, through the words: "Glory to Ukraine", told what he considers the most difficult in his work and the role of a chaplain. In the army.

- The most difficult in chaplain work is to bring the body of the dead soldier to the native thawing soldiers, with whom he was together yesterday. The chaplain is dad, brother, friend, comrade. It is a volunteer, it is one who should feed, wear, pull out of the battlefield, know how to put a harness. The war came to everyone. There is no civilian in the country, because we are all in the war, - said Vasyl Vyrozub.

- I personally remember the history of our three chaplains. Sapphire was an unusual thing, because it was the only vessel that was officially rescue, and they were not entitled to be detained. After the information that was detained and the people were captured, we were immediately captured by the Russian side of the demand to give us people, because they are protected by the Conventions. But there is nothing holy for Russia, and they do not follow any conventions or norms of international humanitarian rule, - said Irina Vereshchuk.

About it [reports](https://t.me/dsszzi_official/5647)State Secretariat of Uterticulum.

"With the help of hackers, Russia is trying to get any information that can be advised in the Convention," the message reads.

[](https://telegra.ph/file/1d07fbce81ccbefea3039.jpg)According to experts, in January 2023, the activity of cyber -refiners was somewhat reduced. This may probably be associated with the enemy New Year holidays. However, the Ulita hackers returned to the usual level of activity.

Since the beginning of this year, an increase in the number of attacks for espionage has been emphasized on the maintenance of constant access to the organization. And even the middle -aged software distributed by Russian hackers is dominated by data collection and remote access to devices.

“It can be one of the signs that Russia is preparing for a long war. She tries to obtain any information that can give preference in the Convention against our country: from mobilization data-to disclosure of the secrets of Western weapons logistics, ”the Dozhaspecs said.

The Russians brazenly sway their crimes, including illegal deportation of Ukrainian children, in particular orphans, but will necessarily be punished for their own.

This [noted](https://minre.gov.ua/2023/03/24/rosiyany-nahabno-hyzuyutsya-svoyimy-zlochynamy-ale-pokarannya-bude/)Irina Vereshchuk, Viceremier-Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories.

“I am frankly shocked by the behavior of Russian officials. It turns out that they are not uncomfortable to commit a crime. They also brazenly sway it. I think this is some kind of consciousness - to show the world your villain. But all this will not be punished without punishment, ”Irina Vereshchuk said.

She reminded that the Ukrainian authorities repeatedly demanded to return orphans, but the Russians were blocking the return of deported orphans. Instead, the Russian Commissioner for the Rights of the Child demonstrated illegally deported orphans from Ukraine.

About this [it is referred](https://mfa.gov.ua/news/zayava-mzs-ukrayini-shchodo-namiriv-rf-rozmistiti-na-teritoriyi-bilorusi-taktichnu-yadernu-zbroyu)On the MZSUKU website.

"The latest statements of the Russian Federation on the intentions to place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus are another provocative step in the criminal Putin regime, which undermines the principles of non -proliferation of nuclear weapons, architectural disarmament and the international security system as a whole."

Such intentions can not but cause much concern for all world community, since Russia declares them under the conditions of continuation of its unexpected aggressive war against Ukraine.

Despite the horrific crimes against humanity and military crimes that the Kremlin conducts this invading war against the sovereign state, Russia is unable to defeat the battlefield.

In the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the states of the Seven European Union group to warn Belarusian authorities about the far -reaching consequences of Belarus, in the event of its consent to accept in its territory tactical nuclear collection from Russia.

Ukraine is expecting effective action to counteract the Kremlin nuclear blackmail from BCA, China, the United States and France, including permanent members of the UN Radion Safety, which are particularly responsible for preventing nuclear weapons. We demand that the UN Security Council meet immediately for this purpose.

Ukraine calls on all members of the world community to bring to the criminal regime a categorical inability to take its regular nuclear provocations to take measures to effectively restrain and prevent any possible use by the state-aggressor of nuclear weapons.

Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible manager of nuclear weapons as a means of restraining and preventing war, and non -instrumental threats and intimidation. The world must unite against the one who is jeopardizing the future of human civilization.

** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

Today, our National Guard celebrates its day, and it will be right if we thank the National Guard together. For the National Guard, along with all the warriors, he powerfully beat Ukraine. Thank you for the strength and strength of killing for the Donbas. For the defense of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. For the heroic protection of Mariupoli "Azovstal". For fighting in Luhansk region. For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.

Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.

During the large -scale war, almost 5,000 National Guards have been marked by state awards - it is for participation in battles, for bravery, for stability, a slaughter, which is reached by the National Guard. 32 National Guard fighters awarded Hero of Ukraine.

I thank all the Guards: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command!Thank you who helps the National Guard units, who trains the fighters, provides them with them necessary, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation.

The power of Ukraine is the power of all who fight for Ukraine and who helps the soldiers. It is simply impossible to Yuena our state force without the National Guard.

Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special participant. He also held meetings with intelligence.

Defense, strengthening of our protection - both from the external threat, as well as the internal threats. We are preparing our appropriate steps.

Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.

It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.

It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.

He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.

We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.

In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.

Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.

57 Separate Motor Infantry Brigade, 5th Separate Storm Brigade and 93rd Separate Brigade-Well done, boys!Thank you for your power!

Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-all in Donetsk-thank you for being the best in the week!

I also want to celebrate our warriors today, which defend the summary and Chernihiv region. It is also a defense against attempts to start DRG across the border, it is the attachment of Ukraine from air strikes, it is also a protection against terrorists.** _ Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle!_ **

** _ Thank all who help defense!_ **

** _ Eternal memory and respect to all our soldiers who gave their lives in Ukraine!_ **

**_Glory to Ukraine!_**
