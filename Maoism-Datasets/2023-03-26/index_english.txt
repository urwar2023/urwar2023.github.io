The Russians brazenly sway their crimes, including illegal deportation of Ukrainian children, in particular orphans, but will necessarily be punished for their own.
This noted Irina Vereshchuk, Viceremier-Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories.
“I am frankly shocked by the behavior of Russian officials. It turns out that they are not uncomfortable to commit a crime. They also brazenly sway it. I think this is some kind of consciousness - to show the world your villain. But all this will not be punished without punishment, ”Irina Vereshchuk said.
She reminded that the Ukrainian authorities repeatedly demanded to return orphans, but the Russians were blocking the return of deported orphans. Instead, the Russian Commissioner for the Rights of the Child demonstrated illegally deported orphans from Ukraine.

 Ukraine appeals to the Belarusian society to prevent the realization of nuclear weapons in Belarus, which will even turn this country into a Kremlin's hostage and have a catastrophic minute for its future.
About this it is referred On the MZSUKU website.
"The latest statements of the Russian Federation on the intentions to place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus are another provocative step in the criminal Putin regime, which undermines the principles of non -proliferation of nuclear weapons, architectural disarmament and the international security system as a whole."
Such intentions can not but cause much concern for all world community, since Russia declares them under the conditions of continuation of its unexpected aggressive war against Ukraine.
Despite the horrific crimes against humanity and military crimes that the Kremlin conducts this invading war against the sovereign state, Russia is unable to defeat the battlefield.
In the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the states of the Seven European Union group to warn Belarusian authorities about the far -reaching consequences of Belarus, in the event of its consent to accept in its territory tactical nuclear collection from Russia.
Ukraine is expecting effective action to counteract the Kremlin nuclear blackmail from BCA, China, the United States and France, including permanent members of the UN Radion Safety, which are particularly responsible for preventing nuclear weapons. We demand that the UN Security Council meet immediately for this purpose.
Ukraine calls on all members of the world community to bring to the criminal regime a categorical inability to take its regular nuclear provocations to take measures to effectively restrain and prevent any possible use by the state-aggressor of nuclear weapons.
Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible manager of nuclear weapons as a means of restraining and preventing war, and non -instrumental threats and intimidation. The world must unite against the one who is jeopardizing the future of human civilization.

For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.
Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.

Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.
It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.
It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.
He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.
We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.
In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.
Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.
