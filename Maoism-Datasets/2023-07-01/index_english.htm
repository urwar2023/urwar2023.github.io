<p>This was said in [interview with Spanish journalists]](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/6795)President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>“Every meter, every kilometer costs people's lives and you can't send people <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zagibel">died</a>. Because it is necessary to get rich before the summit, because one of the partners lacks information and confidence that he supports Ukraine in vain. This is a policy, and we are in real life. And, unfortunately, in our lives it is a real war. And, unfortunately, such a cockroach, ”the President said.</p>
<p>He noted that there are things that can be done very quickly, "but the field is replaced. You can't send people to die. " Ukraine does not treat its people as a resource, so it does relative to its Russian Federation, the President added.</p>
<p>“We are our treasure and therefore we are very careful. We will definitely win. Sometimes the weather also does not contribute, there were heavy, long rains and these are slowing processes. Sometimes the partners who support us pass something slower than we were expecting. And you can't take risks and go forward until everything is not worth it, ”Zelensky said.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3725818-kontrnastup-jde-nelegko-bo-rf-zaminuvala-200-tisac-km-zelenskij.html)He stressed that the most important thing is that our military is going forward. "Not as fast as someone wanted. But if they were asked about the deadlines, these are two and thousands of people, or three months and will die less. I would ask about 4-5 months and a minimum of losses. Because people are more important in time," states.</p>
<p>.How reported Ukrinform, the commander -in -chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeryzaluzhny criticized external comments that the counter -offensive was more slow than expected, since each meter of liberated territory was given by the more blood.</p>

<p>In a comment to Ukrinform, a member of the Ichkeria Government in exile Inalsherip reported this in a comment.</p>
<p>"We are working on the possibility of creating a separate tribunal through Ramzan Cadirov's religious, extremely radical sect" Akhmat, "the politician said.</p>
<p>The Ichkeria government in exile believes that the ideology professed by the Akhmat unit, justifying its participation in the war against Ukraine and murder of Ukrainians, gives reason to consider it a religious extremist sect, which provides a generic for the peoples of the Caucasus, Europe and Ukraine.</p>
<p>“This religious sect has committed crimes against humanity in Europe. Religiousness launches roots both in Chechnya and in the North Caucasus and all over the world. Therefore, the creation of a special journey on Kadyrov and Akhmatat is very important for Chechnya and Ukraine, ”Serip said.</p>
<p>According to him, a large group of religious managers of ripe thousand people was created in Chechnya, many of them have been educated at Damascus University in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-siria">Syria</a>.</p>
<p>“It is no secret for experts that virtually all graduates of the Sharia Branch University of Damascus from the post -Soviet countries are controlled by the Russian GRU. The Russian Secret Service has long been specializing in a religious topic. Therefore, it is important to display all those involved in the creation of Akhmat's unit inside the dew and its possessions, ”said Ichkeria's government member in exile.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3675183-glava-uradu-ickerii-zaklikav-narodi-kavkazu-zrivati-mobilizaciu-v-rosii.html)He informed that he represented the idea of creating a special about a special about Kadyrov with a nail level in the United States, it was also discussed with members of the inter -factional association "For decolonization and dismantling of the Russian Empire" in the Verkhovna Rada.</p>
<p>According to Serip, consultations on the mechanism of creation of this tribunal continue, as there were no such precedents.</p>
<p>"If we manage to create a special tribunal on Kadyrov, qualifying Ahmat as a religious extremist sectarian group that poses a threat, it is evident that we will destroy the structure they created and which today is justified by the murder of the Ukrainian people," the politician said.As it was reported, "Akhmat" is a special unit within the troops of the National Guard of Russia, which is stationed in the Chechen Republic and which commanded Kadyrov. This detachment is involved in the invasion of Russia into Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cavorus suspects servicemen and the unit commander in the involvement of the civilians of Ukraine.</p>
<p>During his visit to the Kremlin in March 2022, the Chechen leader told Putin that his forces in Ukraine would help Russia to "fight to the victorious end."</p>

<p>“It is striking that Prigogine has sharply accused the Kremlin with a muddy justification for invading Ukraine and the war with Russian military leadership. The influence of these words and those actions will be observed for some time. It is a vivid reminder of the devastating impact of Putin's war on his own society and his own regime, ”Burns stated during a lecture for a special commercial fund(England), which is engaged in American-British relations.</p>

<p>About it on air <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101750">Ukrainian radio</a>Pavel Kovtonyuk told the co -founder of the Ukrainian Health Center, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>"Although people continue to get sick, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-koronavirus">coronavirus</a>becomes a routine disease. It will be included in the set of all viral diseases that circulate in our population. In winter, it will be put more, in the summer - less. That is, Kovid will become something like influenza. Recall that the Grip also once caused pandemics and great mortality. Strains mutate, people get used to them and viruses get used to people, and over time we learn to live. While coronavirus became similar to a routine viral disease, 300,000 people were swept. This is the price we paid for the period, the collar -cavirus from the new virus has become something familiar to us, "Kovtonyuk said.</p>
<p>He also emphasized the problems of vaccination. According to him, about a third of the population was made in the Ukrainianchepher from the coronavirus, and this is not necessary for collective protection.</p>
<p>"Vaccination is a thing where or everyone or no one. We needed to provoke a minimum of three-quarters of the population-any other result gave anything. And about a third of the population was drawn, so we are not very prepared for a united response to such Threats, as Pandemia. 38% of vaccinated do not give collective protection against the virus. These individual people have these people, but the collective - no, " - said the expert.</p>
<p>*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3729520-lasko-koronavirus-ne-znik-ale-vin-vtracae-agresivnist.html)According to him, the reasons for the unwillingness of the population to do vaccinations are the extramongs of medicine and health. "It is a matter of respect, people were not getting forced, they did not trust the state, did not trust the medical system, someone is just poorly educated and informed. These problems need a very serious analysis. Because new pandemics will be definitely established by public health experts," added Kovtonyuk.Photo: Evgeniy Maloletka</p>

<p>Last time in <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-culture/3717775-muzicni-istorii-ak-muzicna-evrointegracia-rozbivae-stereotipi-pro-stili-ta-vikonavciv.html">cycle of podcasts</a>We have begun a journey with musical stories, exploring how the musical cultures of different countries are influenced by one and one and what interesting phenomena it sometimes gives rise to. We will expand our geography of the goodness of countries - from south of Europe to its western and northern boundaries. As always, music will give you a lot of surprises, paradoxes and unusual storylights.</p>
<p>In Georgia, you will hear a wonderful composition that combines traditional Georgian male singing and French chanson.</p>
<p>In Belgium, a classic American black blues will be woven to chanson, and Vandinavia is awaited by an exotic, as one of the presenters, a complete level: Norwegian hip-hop says.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-07-01T11-34-00-03-00/1688200160-452.jpg" />In Turkey, you are waiting, guess, Muslim rock, but do not be mistaken, minutely American sound, well, a little, of course, Japanese influences.</p>
<p>The Lithuanians will offer fed pop-rhythms combined with exquisite electronics, and the Spaniards(In one composition)- rattling mixture of rap, hip-hop, regime, Latin ...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-07-01T11-34-00-03-00/1688200162-132.png" />When ethnic Portuguese will offer you somewhat in the style of Clezmer, or a clergy- a strange mixture of Jewish, Balkan and Eastern European tunes, laid on a jazz basis, you will simply plunge into our new music history, Jesami will not notice how it will come. How is it all, you ask yourself?!No, not all. There will be a third story from a series about music European integration, and believe me, there are also many surprises.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-07-01T11-34-00-03-00/1688200163-499.png" />So far, it is clearer what we are about and who we are today, in detail, to speak, what is on the menu:</p>
<p>Countries: Georgia, Ireland, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Lithuania, Portugal, Poland, Bulgaria, Turkey, Croatia.</p>

<p><em>Video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua">Presidential Office</a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainian women!</strong></p>
<p>We complete this day in the Rivne region - I held the next field meeting. Clavial security issues in the northern regions of our country, our measures of safety. All that concerns both the border and our forces, the North, I -Ukrainian Strategic Objects, such as the Rivne Nuclear Station, which was actually a rate.</p>
<p>There were reports of intelligence, the head, the commander of the North, the head of the border service, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the head of the regional state administration of Rivne region on social issues and needs of people. Also, the head of the head of "Energoatom" Kotin, director of Rivne NPP.</p>
<p>In general, not only worked in detail about the physical safety of most strategic objects and northern regions, but also such sensitive issues as cybersecurity.</p>
<p>I thank everyone and everyone in the Rivne region and here at the Rivne NPP, and the entire perimeter of our northern border, who care about the safety of Ukraine of drowned people.</p>
<p>Today, the next package of sanctions of Ukraine against those who helps Russia to wage this terrorist war. In particular, there are sanctions against nearly 300 legal entities and almost 200 individuals. And these are not only Russian citizens. All who will help the aggressor in the world will receive a response to Ukraine and the world.</p>
<p>Today, the Prime Minister of Spain Sanchez was a visit to Ukraine. It is strongly - on the first day of the beginning of the Spanish presidency at the EU Council. This is clearly indicative of a new reality. Our joint European Dimony could not be imagined without Ukraine. And now we have achieved the political level that European affairs without Ukraine are already not considered.</p>
<p>This visit of Mr. Prime Minister Sanchez talks about the priorities of Spanish Chairman and our cooperation. I thank you, Spain, for the support of - Observer, political, economic!I would like to thank for the respect and help people who found shelter in Spain, escaping from the fighting in Ukraine. I believe that soon we can provide all the necessary conditions for our people to turn home to Ukraine.I am also grateful to those countries with which we have not yet such jointly signed and declared declarations, but which clearly support Ukraine on the path of Vinto, and therefore support the approach of real peace throughout Europe. Thank you!</p>
<p>And one more.</p>
<p>The National Commission for Energy and Utility Services on Water tariffs has emerged today. To put it mildly, a shameful solution. Not agreed with the government. We cannot and will not perceive such decisions. The government is instructed to submit a decision. And they will be.</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

<p>About this <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101762">Ukrainian radio</a>Architect Oleg Grechukh said, analyzing how best to reject the postvoline homes, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>He noted that more foreign specialists should be involved in order to change the Soviet architectural paradigm.</p>
<p>"The experience of English industrial cities and Ukrainian is different, because Ukraine300 years colonized and industrialized by the Soviet authorities. Very many cities were focused on the Soviet military industry and the actual moment there was how they would [live] there <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zitlo">live</a>people. After all, the task of those people was to go and produce weapons, which is why our cities were formed quite rigidly. Plus it is unesthetic. There was a Soviet utopian idea that it was a lot of trees to worry, and there are many trees and there were houses between them and the streets were there. But we know: they are wide because tanks had to pass there, "the expert said.</p>
<p>According to him, to process this aggression, which has been built in the vicchitecture of cities for many years and is aimed at resisting, for a completely different philosophy, the direction of development is difficult for both us and Western architects.</p>
<p>"But we have to attract more Western experiences to change our paradigm. It is enough to hold on to the Soviet School of Architecture," he said.</p>

<p>About this <a href="https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101762">Ukrainian radio</a>Architect Oleg Grechukh said, analyzing how best to reject the postvoline homes, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>He noted that more foreign specialists should be involved in order to change the Soviet architectural paradigm.</p>
<p>"The experience of English industrial cities and Ukrainian is different, because Ukraine300 years colonized and industrialized by the Soviet authorities. Very many cities were focused on the Soviet military industry and the actual moment there was how they would [live] there <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zitlo">live</a>people. After all, the task of those people was to go and produce weapons, which is why our cities were formed quite rigidly. Plus it is unesthetic. There was a Soviet utopian idea that it was a lot of trees to worry, and there are many trees and there were houses between them and the streets were there. But we know: they are wide because tanks had to pass there, "the expert said.</p>
<p>According to him, to process this aggression, which has been built in the vicchitecture of cities for many years and is aimed at resisting, for a completely different philosophy, the direction of development is difficult for both us and Western architects.</p>
<p>"But we have to attract more Western experiences to change our paradigm. It is enough to hold on to the Soviet School of Architecture," he said.</p>

<p>1 . The President of Ukraine and the Head of the Government of Spain have confirmed their unambiguous Russian aggressive war against Ukraine, which continues and undermine the international order and charter of the United States. Ukraine has demonstrated a great determination in the exercise of its inconsistency right to self -defense against this uncontrollable attack. Russia must immediately and unconditionally echo its armed forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized border.</p>
<p>2 . Spain confirms its unwavering dedication to the independence, sovereignty of Ukraine's and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders Ivisoko assesses the determination and courage of the Ukrainian people and its armed forces of fate from illegal Russian aggression and in ensuring the free yoccratic future of Ukraine.</p>
<p>3 .

Spain will continue to provide political, humanitarian and military support to Ukraine and its people, both individually and within the framework of international service, in particular as the Chairman of the Council of the European Union, as much as it will be required.</p>
<p>4 . Spain supports Ukraine's initiative to achieve a just and old peace in accordance with the international law and the UN Charter and the basic and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as provided for in President Vladimir Zelensky's formalimir. Spain approves the key principles of the Ukrainian peace and will continue to cooperate with Ukraine in order to expand the international support of the Ukrainian peace formula, in particular, through the recent global peace of peace. Spain is already making a significant contribution to the formula, including food security.6 . Ukraine and Spain agree with the need to continue the collective -paramount pressure on Russia in order to weaken its ability to continue the non -consumed aggressive war. It is necessary to strengthen efforts to ensure the effective compliance of sanctions, counteracting their bypass and avoidance of unbearable consequences. Due attention should also be paid to the global -negative consequences of the Russian aggressive war, in particular in the field of food security. Spain fully supports current initiatives aimed at taking over and softening of these consequences, including the Spanish plan for counter -food danger and the "paths of solidarity" of the EU - Ukraine, and calls for a pre -agreed continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and Humanitarian Program.</p>
<p>7 . Ukraine and Spain will continue to work together with other parties to overcome the mechanisms to ensure compensation for losses, damage and losses caused by Russian aggression.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-01T81-00-00-04-00/crime-putin.jpg" />About what prospects for creating a special international tribunade by the leader of the criminal Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, the Armyinform <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/">told</a>Director of the Research Institute of Lawmaking and Research and Legal Expertise of the National Academy of Law of Ukraine(Eg), Doctor of Laws, Professor, Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Honored Lawyer of Ukraine Alexei Kot.</p>
<p>The correspondent of the information agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was the hope that in respect of Putin, according to the results of joint work of the Armed Forces, international partners, politicians, lawyers, representatives of the public, the pity will still adhere to the main principle of criminal law - inevitability of punishment.</p>
<p>Another thing, how to provide it? To continue your <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/06/30/sogodni-mizhnarodne-pravo-zabezpechuyut-zbrojni-syly-ukrayiny-oleksij-kot/">interview</a>Our agency Alexei Kot reported that in theory there are such possible models of prosecution of the Russian authorities of the Russian authorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Courts of the aggressor state. 2. National Ukrainian courts. 3. International Criminal Court(International Criminal Court / International Criminal Court).  4. Міжнародний кримінальний трибунал (or a special tribunal).</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the well -known lawyer, the first scenario with the involvement of Putin and his widowers by the courts of Russia is now absolutely unrealistic or even fantastic. Our national courts will also not be able to investigate Putin's military room, which has judicial immunity.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, the UN International Court of Justice clearly determined that national courts have jurisdictions over higher officials of foreign states. The head of state, the head of the foreign country and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are the so -called three, which is endowed with the personal immunity of Ratio Personae, - said Alexei Kot.The International Criminal Court was created by signing the Roman statute to ensure that military criminals are prosecuted, but it does not allow investigation in an inhabita regime - that is, retrieved -a -criminal proceedings. Therefore, Putin as an accused must be in the courtroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last model of attraction of an international criminal, according to Professor, is a national special tribunal - can have certain varieties: such as the Nurneberg or Tokyo Process, in the form of an internationalized or hybrid tribunal on the basis of the Ukrainian Court with the participation of international security officers. United Nations. But in the last case, Russia will undoubtedly vet such a decision of the Council.</p>
<p>The reason for the creation of the tribunal could be the resolution of the General Assembly, however, in view of its charter, neither in the General Assembly, nor such powers in the Secretary General. Therefore, it can question the authority of such a tribunal.</p>
<p>-Speaking of a more or less real option, at least as I see it with my colleagues discussed it at various conferences-it should be a "criminal ramstin". In the end, there is a coalition of our disadvantages, so partners, so I think it would be quite reasonable to ask about the creation of a special International Criminal Court of AD HOC <em>(letters. For a specific case. - Ed.)</em> To consider exclusively military crimes committed by the Russian criminal leadership in our country of anti -Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian cities and towns, Ukrainian nature, - says Alexei Kot. - The agreement on the creation of such a tribunal must be imposed on its powers, procedural aspects, the possibility of joining the signatures of other countries. We know that defeat is always an orphan, and there are always many parents. When we still get our dream trainery, there will be many countries in the hesitation, but later with the fair -to -face "pick up this deck" and join this tribunal. The possible way to join such an agreement should be provided in advance.Photo by the author, collage of the Inform Army</p>

And it should also be noted that the most active countries of Ukraine - first of all, the United States and the European Union - have already begun to plan that it will probably be the most ambitious post -war reconstruction in the modern history.</p>
<p>Experts believe that Ukraine's efforts will be significantly different in recent post -war reconstruction initiatives in Iraq and Afghanistan. This extraction will resemble the situation in Western Europe after World War II, as well as Eastern Europe after the Cold War and Western Balkans after the disintegration. The lessons of these episodes should be a source of information for Ukraine. Their basic and successful formula was created earlier. Thus, at that time, they provided money and safety, and Europeans provided the main part of financial and advanced the historical process of European integration.</p>
<p>And security will be as important as the reconstruction of Ukraine, since the safety of tarestructure mutually reinforce each other. Reliable safety mechanisms increase confidence in order to risk and take on long -term obligations.</p>
<p>However, Ukraine's growth prospects will need a powerful component. Ukraine will need to manage large -scale funding, and the trust of the Donea will be the focus. Accordingly, Ukraine and its donors will need a powerful inspector and effective monitoring and evaluation. The Ukrainian will have a call - but will also be able to make up for 30 years in a non -core economic and political development.</p>
<p>The reconstruction should be organized around several simple principles: Ukraine has to identify priorities, while the United States should lead security and the EU to manage economic reforms and restoration.</p>
<p>Let us mention historical parallels: in order to control the reconstruction of Eastern Europe after the cold war, Congress gave one senior coordinator wide supervisor. The reproduction of this approach for Ukraine will strengthen the US contribution: a collective event should have high -ranking officials in Ukraine who are in contact with the Ukrainian authorities, there are not enough periodic donor conferences.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-07-01T90-00-00-04-00/29.06.23_vidnovlennya-ukrayiny_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Private investments are likely to provide the main part of the funding of Ukraine's restoration. And frozen Russian assets, both official and private, can make a significant contribution to this process, but they will use serious legal justification.</p>
<p>Today, Ukraine has urgent needs for both economic and security assistance, they will not end after the termination of hostilities. Ukraine's restoration can take decades, and constant public support will be vital. The reconstruction of Ukraine will be a long difficult business. But the event should decide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politicians must carefully study the alternatives, as well as foreign, for the safety of Ukraine, preparing for interaction with the Allies. Guaranteed safety is important for any other aspect of reconstruction. * The Takongress administration should approve a modern version of laws that will allow US activities to be in central and Eastern Europe. And an important component will be the creation of an authorized coordinator to work with European governments, international financial institutions, as well as with the population and the government in Ukraine. * Public support for US long -term policy in Ukraine is not possible to be taken for granted. This will require the effort of both parties to explain and create support among the American people.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge of reforming and reconstruction of Ukraine should be considered through the prism of post-war reinforcement and reintegration of Europe, as well as 75 years of security and economic policy. Safety and reconstruction will be a way. A safe, economically prosperous Ukraine, which is fully integrated by the European institutions, will be a significant achievement that will lead to the implementation of a European projection of many generations, which is supported by a strong transatlantic partnership.</p>

<p>Водночас важливо пам’ятати, що COVID-19 нікуди не зникає, а SARS-CoV-2циркулюватиме надалі. Проте хвороба перейшла до групи сезонних захворювань, якгрип. Отже, скасування карантину не скасовує вакцинацію – вона залишаєтьсяєдиним способом запобігти тяжкому перебігу захворювання, ускладнень і смерті.В Україні щеплення проти COVID-19 залишаються рекомендованими і безоплатними.Країна забезпечена вакциною в межах програми COVAX на 2024 рік.</p>
<p>Карантин в Україні тривав понад три роки – від березня 2020. Скільки українцівмали підтверджений діагноз «коронавірусна інфекція», скільки змогли поборотиковід і скільки – ні – дивіться у нашій інфографіці.</p>

<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainian women!</strong></p>
<p>We complete this day in the Rivne region - I spent another outbound rate. All that concerns both the border and our forces, the North, I -Ukrainian Strategic Objects, such as the Rivne Nuclear Station, which was actually a rate.</p>
<p>There were reports of intelligence, the head, the commander of the North, the head of the border service, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the head of the regional state administration of Rivne region on social issues and needs of people. Also, the head of the head of "Energoatom" Kotin, director of Rivne NPP.</p>
<p>In general, not only worked in detail about the physical safety of most strategic objects and northern regions, but also such sensitive issues as cybersecurity.</p>
<p>I thank everyone and everyone in the Rivne region and here at the Rivne NPP, and the entire perimeter of our northern border, who care about the safety of Ukraine of drowned people.</p>
<p>Today, the next package of sanctions of Ukraine against those who helps Russia to wage this terrorist war. In particular, there are sanctions against nearly 300 legal entities and almost 200 individuals. And these are not only Russian citizens. All who will help the aggressor in the world will receive a response to Ukraine and the world.</p>
<p>Today, the Prime Minister of Spain Sanchez was a visit to Ukraine. It is strongly - on the first day of the beginning of the Spanish presidency in the Council of the European Union. This is clearly indicative of a new reality. Our joint European Dimony could not be imagined without Ukraine. And now we have achieved the political level that European affairs without Ukraine are already not considered.</p>
<p>This visit of Mr. Prime Minister Sanchez talks about the priorities of Spanish Chairman and our cooperation. I thank you, Spain, for the support of - opposite, political, economic!I would like to thank for the respect and help people who found shelter in Spain, escaping from the fighting in Ukraine. I believe that soon we can provide all the necessary conditions for our people to turn home to Ukraine.I am also grateful to those countries with which we have not yet such jointly signed and declared declarations, but which clearly support Ukraine on the path of Vinto, and therefore support the approach of real peace throughout Europe. Thank you!</p>
<p>And one more.</p>
<p>The National Commission for Energy and Utility Services on Water tariffs has emerged today. To put it mildly, a shameful solution. Not agreed with the government. We cannot and will not perceive such decisions. The government is instructed to submit a decision. And they will be.</p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>
