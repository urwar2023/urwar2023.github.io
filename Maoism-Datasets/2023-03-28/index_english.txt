 President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy applied to Ukrainians on the 395th day of the war:
_ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ 
Today, our National Guard celebrates its day, and it will be right if we thank the National Guard together. For the National Guard, along with all the warriors, he powerfully beat Ukraine. Thank you for the strength and strength of killing for the Donbas. For the defense of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. For the heroic protection of Mariupoli "Azovstal". For fighting in Luhansk region. For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.
Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.
During the large -scale war, almost 5,000 National Guards have been marked by state awards - it is for participation in battles, for bravery, for stability, a slaughter, which is reached by the National Guard. 32 National Guard fighters awarded Hero of Ukraine.
I thank all the Guards: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command!Thank you who helps the National Guard units, who trains the fighters, provides them with them necessary, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation.
The power of Ukraine is the power of all who fight for Ukraine and who helps the soldiers. It is simply impossible to Yuena our state force without the National Guard.
Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special participant. He also held meetings with intelligence.
Defense, strengthening of our protection - both from the external threat, as well as the internal threats. We are preparing our appropriate steps.
Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.
It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.
It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.
He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.
We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.
In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.
Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.
57 Separate Motor Infantry Brigade, 5th Separate Storm Brigade and 93rd Separate Brigade-Well done, boys!Thank you for your power!
Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-all in Donetsk-thank you for being the best in the week!
I also want to celebrate our warriors today, which defend the summary and Chernihiv region. It is also a defense against attempts to start DRG across the border, it is the attachment of Ukraine from air strikes, it is also a protection against terrorists. _ Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle!_ 
_ Thank all who help defense!_ 
_ Eternal memory and respect to all our soldiers who gave their lives in Ukraine!_

 NATO countries should not be given importance to the Kremlin's statements on the placement of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, since the protection of the Alliance from the threat of a nuclear tight is ensured, regardless of where it can be caused.
About it reported Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvidas Anushauskas.
"Russia is taking new steps, trying to cause dissatisfaction with politicians with the support of Ukraine or intimidate countries that support Ukraine. Development of nuclear weapons in Belarus only testifies to Putin's concerns about NATO's strength on the eastern flank after the war against Ukraine. What will not be worth it now. Country defense of nuclear weapons threat is guaranteed regardless of whether it is located west from our borders(Kaliningrad region), east(Belarus)Or north(Leningrad region)”, - said the head of Lithuania defense.
According to him, the United States also perceive Putin's step very moderately - they are not unique to change any of their plans for nuclear restraint.

Civil infrastructure remains the main purpose of Russian hackers. First, the central authorities. Since the beginning of this year, significant attacks and local governments have been registered(second place in number).
Про це повідомляє State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine.
According to the experts of the Government Response Team to Cert-UA, a year ago, the Sector of Security and Defense took the second place a year ago.
Such a high proportion indicates not only that this segment is interesting for the hackers, but also that local authorities are still insufficiently protected by the enemy, which is usually explained by a lack of funds and experts.
Recall that during January-February 2023 the Government Response Team of Cert-UA, which operates at the State Security Service, worked out More than 300 cyberincidential cyberattacks.

 Center for Combating Misinformation in NSDCs debunk Fake of the Russian Federation: 
Rospropaganda is actively spreading the news of intercepting the first managed missileglsdb, despite the fact that Ukraine, at least officially, has not received them from allies
Actually 
GLSDB missiles are not yet armed in the United States and the US administration orders this weapon for Ukraine from the manufacturer - Boeing and SAAB, and does not transmit to the US Armed Forces.
The United States military aid package was announced on February 32023, and the first batch of GLSDB missiles, according to Western analysts, will be able to nine months.
However, Rospropagandists, led by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, lack of data in Ukraine does not prevent them from "intercepting" and boasting in fictional victories.
