<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Today, our National Guard celebrates its day, and it will be right if we thank the National Guard together. For the National Guard, along with all the warriors, he powerfully beat Ukraine. Thank you for the strength and strength of killing for the Donbas. For the defense of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. For the heroic protection of Mariupoli "Azovstal". For fighting in Luhansk region. For the fighting in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kiev. They keep defense in the south, in the Zaporozhye direction.</p>
<p>Separately, I want to thank for the onset of the offensive, which has already become an example of the formation of new brigades for Ukrainian defense.</p>
<p>During the large -scale war, almost 5,000 National Guards have been marked by state awards - it is for participation in battles, for bravery, for stability, a slaughter, which is reached by the National Guard. 32 National Guard fighters awarded Hero of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thank all the Guards: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command!Thank you who helps the National Guard units, who trains the fighters, provides them with them necessary, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The power of Ukraine is the power of all who fight for Ukraine and who helps the soldiers. It is simply impossible to Yuena our state force without the National Guard.</p>
<p>Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special participant. He also held meetings with intelligence.</p>
<p>Defense, strengthening of our protection - both from the external threat, as well as the internal threats. We are preparing our appropriate steps.</p>
<p>Constantly, unchanged maximum attention - the situation on the forefront. Cruel battles, how much they take away the lives of our people and require a permanent mobilized stinker state and society every day.</p>
<p>It is wrong, it is unfair when our fighters who come in the front have a feeling that for many, the war has been in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk or Nikopol, Saltivka, from the border areas of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhya ... And who is thoughtful from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.Dear Ukrainians!Support our fighters always when possible. Also, also about volunteer meetings and join when you can.</p>
<p>It is very important that everyone who has information influence is involved in the viral work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to anyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world of pro -Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who have passed through occupation through losses ... about what Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for both our people and for all the currents that are threatened by Russian tyranny. The world should be heard as intensively as last year that aggression against Ukraine is ongoing. He should hear that to end the war this year, to liberate Ukraine from Russian evil this year - the recipient task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, the irrespection to protect civilization.</p>
<p>He met with goodwill Ambassador UNICEF Orlando Bloom and UNICEF -Organization team that deals with humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlandoblum has long been working with this direction. He was already in Ukraine, Nanha Donbass, even before the full -scale war. And he knows that this aggression has brought, how full -scale the efforts of the world should be to stop it to draw Ukraine after the war.</p>
<p>We discussed the issue of reconstruction of our country, our school infrastructure. Avid this help. We agreed to make our teams work on a few layers.</p>
<p>In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were exported to Russia by the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of dystioning training in areas and areas where it is impossible to study offline secrets.</p>
<p>Today, as always, I will celebrate our soldiers, who gave a significant result of Ukraine for the last day, for this day, in general this week.</p>
<p>57 Separate Motor Infantry Brigade, 5th Separate Storm Brigade and 93rd Separate Brigade-Well done, boys!Thank you for your power!</p>
<p>Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich"-all in Donetsk-thank you for being the best in the week!</p>
<p>I also want to celebrate our warriors today, which defend the summary and Chernihiv region. It is also a defense against attempts to start DRG across the border, it is the attachment of Ukraine from air strikes, it is also a protection against terrorists.<strong> _ Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle!_ </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ Thank all who help defense!_ </strong></p>
<p><strong> _ Eternal memory and respect to all our soldiers who gave their lives in Ukraine!_ </strong></p>

<p>The Swedish company IKEA has sold its last enterprise in Russia - a furniture factory in the Podbereza Novgorod region. In total, Sweden has built on the Russian Federation of three -factories for the production of furniture, but since the beginning of Russian full -scale aggression against Ukraine decided to leave the Russian Federation completely.</p>
<p>The head of the Gossuum Volodin proposed to change the current legislation in order to conquer the activities of the International Criminal Court in Russia.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economy of the Russian Federation has closed access to the portal of administrative professionalism and open civil control "Operations", introduced in 2014. Formally, because the authorities provide the Russian Federation with information that only 20-40 % corresponded to their real notes on obtaining statistical information, registers and state -owned bases. On their basis, entrepreneurs in particular were able to adjust their business to inadequate services to citizens.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has banned the sale of shares of companies from "unfriendly", according to Russia, countries until October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>More than 52 % of male Russians do not live up to 65 years of age, - said the Chief Specialist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation on reproductive health.</p>
<p>The occupation authorities of Crimea have promised that the Government of the Russian Federation would provide financial assistance to ensure minimum wages to the employees of the tourism industry of the peninsula.</p>
<p>In Russia, there is a shortage of cadaver - corpses on which medical workers study. As a result, the price of cadaver increased by 80-120 %, the accident of training courses by 20-30 %. Currently, Russian companies are trying to adjust the supply of corpses under the scheme of parallel import.</p>
<p>The roselvsky supervision found a dangerous disease - dwarf soot - in seed, imported to Russia from Belarus. The import of almost 5 tons of wheat was debated, the party was returned to the supplier.</p>

The head of the united Present Center of Defense forces of South of Ukraine Natalia Humeniuk, a united Press Center of Defense of South of Ukraine, said in the direct elage of the Tele scale.</p>
<p>-In the direction of the Dnieper-Buzi estuary for three days in a row there is no visualization. Obviously, after the destruction of the field warehouse with ammunition at the same way, the Russians do not have the possibility of their supply. Also, the enemy does not have the possibility of pulling equipment, even mortar weapons, since the successful work of our units was destroyed by their combat positions, ashtorm does not allow free movement. Therefore, we work together with the forces of nature we continue to liberate our territories.</p>
<p>Humeniuk also noted that in the southern direction there is a certain increase in the activity of the enemy.</p>
<p>-This is due to the work of security and defense units for cleaning the 20-30-kilometer strip on the left bank of the Dnieper. This combat work is undergoing and has results. For example, shelling of the Kherson region of the past was fixed at 90-100 shelling per day. Currently, this figure has fallen to 50-60. This suggests that the logistics of the enemy is seriously undermined, they have increased many warehouses and weapons, including artillery and jet installations, and cannot establish a new supply of weapons and ammunition. Automation of anti -polishing missiles last day in the Kherson region, say that the enemy continues to use aviation and is very afraid of our prototypical defense.</p>

<p>It was emphasized the importance of just punishment of all criminals, the efforts of which were broken by the fate of the Russian aggressor of Ukrainian children.</p>
<p>"Only by joint efforts will we be able to save the Ukrainian children stolen by Russia, prove the content of crimes of the Russian military against the Ukrainian people to punish criminals," Daria Gerasimchuk said.</p>
<p>Igor Zhovkva noted that at this time neither the International Committee of the Red Cross, nor any other influential international organization or institution is not justified by the world to save Ukrainian children.</p>
<p>"Together, we have to work out not only the mechanisms and scenarios of rescue Ukrainian children today, but also methods and means, scripts and meaningful ones, which the world can use tomorrow if children need protection or rescue, support or assistance," he stressed.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, the guests received symbolic moto dolls dedicated to Ukrainian children in deportation.</p>

<p>About it <a href="https://gur.gov.ua/content/video-de-nevidomyi-v-ukrainskii-formi-nibyto-striliaie-po-tsyvilnomu-avto-zhinky-z-dytynoiu-ie-prymityvnym-rashystskym-feikom.html">reports</a>GUR MOU.</p>
<p>"Recently, a video on which an unknown person in a Ukrainian military form seems to shoot a civilian car with a young child," is an Erosian fake and a hostile IPSO, "the statement said.</p>
<p>This video was allegedly removed from a registrar in a woman's car.</p>
<p>The following arguments are evidenced by its projection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location in the occupied territory between Donetsk and Makeevka: Turn from the Drug Road DNR; 2. One of the sources of the excite - Nick “Yuri Alekseich Z V”; 3. The Ukrainian soldiers apply solid crosses to their cars. And these are crosses of the Wehrmacht; 4. Registrars in Ukraine are forbidden even in the deep rear and in the west of Ukraine; 5. The car body on which the Ukrainian military seemed to be made in Russia and never shipped to Ukraine; 6. Poor installation. At 1:35 the military in the immediate vicinity of the car shoots from the machine. But there are no loud sounds. The car window is open. There was a conversation through the window. There is no sound from closing the window. When the car goes back again that the window is open. The shot was shown because the video shows the sleeve. At this point, there should be at least some sound.</li>
</ol>
<p>GUR noted that it was a disgusting attempt by hostile IPSO to blamed the Armed Forces soldiers, to show them cruel and inadequate, and to create a conflict with representatives of the Muslim community. This time - with the Crimean Tatars, because from the dialogue of the military and the woman who was driving, it can be understood that it is allegedly belonging to the Crimean Tatar people.</p>
<p>"The video was a complete failure and another blunt fake of Russian propaganda, which in its painful fantasies does not neglect any ethical norms of it," - said in intelligence.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are areas where the distance to the enemy is small, but all attempts somehow improve the tactical position in Russian ending in "underwater expeditions". As for Pomin, we recently organized a defense in a more favorable position, despite the enemy attempts to get us with drones.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-03-28T89-00-00-04-00/golovna-9-1.jpg" />The dangers of spring land work and visits to the wine during Christian holidays for the residents of Kharkiv region were spoken during a briefing with the participation of the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Synigubova and heads of regional structures of law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-03-28T89-00-00-04-00/harkiv-bryfing-vesnyana-nebezpeka-2.jpg" />-In Kharkiv region, 1.2 million hectares of replaced or potentially explosive territories,-said Oleg Synigubov. - 447 settlements, or the villager of the region, were injured by the actions of the invaders. In addition, three hundred thousand kilometers of roads of local importance have not been finally tested for the presence of a mini. It is dangerous to go to their country houses or to go out to nature. At the same time, he owned only one of them and called the SES specialists in a timely manner. The latter had a life or at least prevented him from injury to his relatives.</p>
<p>-Based on all this, during the last meeting of the regional commission, the issues of technogenic and environmental safety issued a decision to prohibit cemetery during Christian holidays. The exception may be based on the decision of local authorities in separate settlements, but agreed by the SES and the SES. Concerning worship in the churches for Easter, they are performed, but within the action of commanding time. That is, from 5: 00 to 23:00, - said Oleg Synigubov.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/harkiv-bryfing-vesnyana-nebezpeka-3.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-03-28T89-00-00-04-00/harkiv-bryfing-vesnyana-nebezpeka-3-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Currently, hundreds of rescuers are demining or providing this work. It was clear to the scale of activity, we get from 300 to 800 appeals daily from citizens about the identification of a dangerous subject. The priority of us is the support of the work of energy, railways and gas suppliers, - Alexander Volobuyev told.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-03-28T89-00-00-04-00/harkiv-bryfing-vesnyana-nebezpeka-5.jpg" />- Over the last 13 months, 24 civilians have been killed in the region from mines. We will not forget the five rescuers and sixhops who died last year during their service tasks. Therefore, I do not arrive at the Kharkiv residents and residents of the region not to attend places, their dachas and not enter the forest strip, and even more Easter will alternate in all 315 Christian churches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, together with the local authorities, we solve all the issues for citizens to be able to embarrass their spiritual needs. Unfortunately, we will not be able to exhibit the patrollers of every cemetery, reservoir or park area. The enemy did a distance, and therefore there are almost no safe places in the region. The day off the departures from the regional center police are clarifying about the way to go to picnics. However, as practice shows, people neglect these ones. As a result, there are fatal cases because of their own irresponsibility, - said Vladimir Timoshko.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speeches of all speakers during a briefing were summed up by the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone will like such strict requirements. However, we only guide safety citizens and evaluate the realities of time soberly. Believe me that we work on this24/7 and we will not stop until the victory, - finally, Oleg Synigubov said.</li>

<p>On March 27, the Kazakhstan Government against the backdrop of reports that Russian companies use local intermediaries to bypass Western sanctions, decide to demand from exporters the provision of additional documents in the course of goods to Russia. The new rules that come into force on April 1 will apply to exports within the Eurasian Economic Union to reduce "underground" trade.</p>
<p>2022 in Russia the production of tractors and combines(in units of technique)decreased by 1 % and 23 % respectively; During January -February 2023, the producers have already lost 11 % of their profit compared to last year. The reasons for such a stand in the Rosspiecmash Association are called a decrease in the profit of agrarians, the unwillingness to buy Russian agricultural machinery, the import of cheaper production from China, Turkey and India.</p>
<p>In the context of the Russian crisis, Rospieczmash appealed to the government for state support.2022, the subsidy for the association was 8 billion rubles, but in 2023 only 2 billion rubles were planned, while producers needed 15 billion rubles. The regulation of the Ministry of Industry, tractors and combines in general should be soldered, respectively, they will be purchased even less.</p>
<p>Russian machine -builders stated that high -tech components of managing equipment at the Russian Federation are produced "in insufficient quantities", "high level of credit rates and taxes, cost and narrow assortment of Metal rental of NAPF, low level of customs protection Quality is 30 % cheaper than Russian. " At the same time, the agrarian states that they are unable not only to buy new housekeeping in the volumes they need, but also to repair what has failed: the cost of Russian products a year increased from 30 % to 70 %.Since the beginning of full -scale military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the main foreign internet, including YouTube, Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, do not provide some resources for advertising Russian companies.</p>
<p>From April 3, Russian Raiffeisenbank will limit the possibility of transferring dollars for private customers, and will increase the minimum threshold of dollars and euros to other banks for individuals.</p>
<p>Rent of rooms has risen significantly: for residents of Vladivostok by 33.2 %, Magnitogorsk - by 30.4 %, Volga - by 29.2 %, Ivanov - by 24.5 %, Stavropol - by 19.2 %, Kemierov - by 18, 9 %, Yakutsk - by 18.2 %, Tomsk - 16.7 %, Vladimir - by 16.4 %, Irkutsk - 16.2 %.</p>
<p>The number of Russian citizens as well as foreigners who have been out of voluntary health insurance for themselves in 2022(DMS), decreased by 5 million people, up to 31.8 million people(According to the results of 2021, there were 7.9 million people growth).</p>
<p>Минулого року кількість офіційно зареєстрованих ВІЛ-інфікованих на росіїзбільшилась на 40 тис. осіб і зараз налічує понад 1,1 млн осіб. За підсумкамипершого кварталу 2023 року, роспотрєбнадзор зафіксував зараження понад 1 %вагітних жінок у 27 регіонах рф.</p>
<p>На білбордах у москві почали транслювати відеоролики про правила збору«тривожної валізи». Водночас влада заспокоює населення повідомленнями, що «цепланові інформаційні відеоролики в рамках функціонування мчс росії».</p>
<p>Черговий російський літак змушений був перервати політ та запросити екстренупосадку. 26 березня борт авіакомпанії «азімут» не зміг долетіти до москви зніжнєго новгорода. Пасажирський літак sukhoi superjet 100, що перебував нависоті трохи більше 3 тис. метрів над містом, подав сигнал тривоги через 10хвилин після зльоту і пробув у повітрі 20 хвилин.</p>
<p>За даними національного статистичного комітету рб, експорт білоруських товарівдо Китаю зріс у 2022 році до 4,7 %. На думку незалежних експертів, цепов’язано не лише з тим, що Китай раптом розкуштував білоруські товари, черезКНР вони можуть йти на ринки третіх країн. На сьогодні білорусь у китайськійзовнішній торгівлі займає лише 0,09 %. Основними партнерами Пекіна є США (16.2% of exports)and EU(15,6 %). Китайський експорт до росії — це 2,1 % відзагального обсягу експорту КНР.</p>
