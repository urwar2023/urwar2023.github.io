 As previously reported, our warriors destroyed another precious hostile helicopter KA-52, known as the "alligator". With the assistance of the United Tavriya defense forces, the Armyonform became known to be famous for how the analogue "alligator" followed the Russian military ship.
The pilot of the Russian helicopter quietly controlled the combat car. It was very confident that it was moving above the temporarily occupied territory of thawing below twenty meters, and the distance to Ukrainian positions was overwhelming. Performing the maneuvers at such a distance, the "Putin -screenwriting" felt almost invulnerable.
The Ukrainian Marines, near the positions of which, had a Russian helicopter, were otherwise thought. The sub-air defense of a separate Marine Corps named after the counter-Admiralhail of Bilinsky performed the task of covering during counter-offensive. Marpich with a call sign "Summer" visually determined the target that was identified as a "Russian shock helicopter KA-52".
The missile, launched from Igla MSrk, hit the tail of the helicopter. Further, "summer", along with the brothers, watched a picturesque picture: praised "alligator", leaving behind the fatty thick smoke, began to lose its height sharply and disappeared from the field of view for a few seconds.
Subsequently, the observers who were in the infantry units of the brigade received confirmation of the affected target. The Alligator has fallen in a territory that is still under the control of the occupiers. So, another praised Russian "alligator" has turned into scrap, which spoils the amazing landscapes of the Ukrainian nature. "But this is a temporary phenomenon," our Marines say.

 The Security Service has collected a evidence base for two Odessa pseudo -journalists, which made staging videos at the request of Russian TV channels. About it reports Security Service of Ukraine.
One of the suspects is the former operator of Odessa State Television, who, after a full-scale invasion, began to cooperate with the Russian TV channel-TV.
According to the investigation, the attacker agreed to the order of the propagandists. For 8 thousand hryvnias, he was familiar with his acquaintance for the role of the "military" of the local center of acquisition.
 The two of them shot a video where the military told how to hunt the Zlovlovs of the conscript age to avoid mobilization.
This fake was aired by Russian Ren-TV, from where he was picked up by more than 20 propaganda information resources, including the largest federal tests.
SBU initiated psychological and linguistic examinations of this video confirmed the facts of criminal acts of the persons involved.
The involvement of the operator in the shooting of a number of custom scenes and events related to the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra is also checked.

Зазначається, що у російському Санкт-Петербурзі пройшла зустріч лідерів семиафриканських країн з президентом Путіним that took place after the official visit of the delegation to Kiev.
For the main purpose of both visits, African leaders set a "peace planned to restore international trade", which calls for termination of fighting and peaceful settlement through negotiations.

Asumani also stressed that peace in Ukraine is important for providing international food and energy security.
"The delegation probably seeks to balance Ukraine and Russia to maintain ancient relations with Russia, without diplomatically associated with the Kremlin's war," the report reads.
In his turn, Putin stated that the Kremlin welcomes the "balanced" approach of the Aphricity states to resolve the issue of war in Ukraine.
Analysts emphasize that the Kremlin is likely to take advantage of this proposal for the promotion of Russian information operations aimed at slowing down western assistance to Ukraine in the sphere of security, at the same time did not show the intent of the intent to participate in any peace process.ISW has already evaluated that the Kremlin regularly signals the fake readiness to regulate the settlement to encourage the event to be concerned and refuse more support for Ukraine.
The Kremlin has already taken advantage of the same "fuzzy peace plan", represented by Chinese in 2023, and tried to use the declared Chinese interest in the reverses in the settlement of war in Ukraine to achieve the desired closer communications with China.
According to Ukrinform, the most fierce fighting on the line of clashes in the course of Ukrainian counter -offensive is observed in three sections. Russian -shaped losses.

“Everyone knows that the best security guarantee for Ukraine is its membership, and I hope it will happen soon. I hope that the Volnya Summit will be announced specific steps that will give everyone understand that the future of Ukraine is in NATO.

 Aggressive Muscovy continues the tactics of nuclear blackmail, using an occupied Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, as well as the territory of Belarus, the dreadful placement of Russian nuclear weapons.
This was stated by a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov during an interview with Anastasia Katerynchuk.
“A number of norms and standards of nuclear safety at the NPP is no longer provided by the current authorities. The fact that they are constantly producing with our Zaporizhzhya atomic station is a nuclear blackmail: it is also the placement of forces and means, weapons there; This is the implementation of shelling by rashists from the territory and in the territory of the lands; It is the terror of the power plant staff and many other factors, ” - said the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.
According to Andriy Yusov, the blackmail on the ZPP and other occupied objects of critical infrastructure is related to the Russian awareness that the occupied territories of Ukraine will have to get out sooner or later.
“The main thing that every Ukrainian and the whole world must understand - in Kakhovka, named" Crimean Titan "and all over Ukraine, and environmental safety at these objects, will be guaranteed when they return under the control of Ukraine and legal power. While Russian terrorists are there, it will be threatened to preserve, ” - said the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

At the same time, the anibilorrian dictator Lukashenko, nor any other in that country is able to influence the placement, use or fate of Russian nuclear weapons.
“Of course, the people of Belarus once again are hostages, now an additional element of nuclear argument, nuclear blackmail. Something additional for NATO, for Ukraine, is not threatened. But Putin shows, they say, she will take some steps on the chessboard, ”Andrei Yusov explained, adding that the dances of Russians with nuclear tambourine in Belarus are expected.
“Despite all the dances with the tambourine, now the nuclear tambourine, for Ukraine, the important factor remains that Belarus is not drawn into full -scale terrestrial Russia against Ukraine, and this is not observed. They want to cover, wave their fists, threaten someone, threateningly move your mustache? - Well, Bellas, " - summed up a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

The officer asked to assist in the constant campaign "support their own" to gather a variety of souvenirs of and joint bracelets and charms for their cooperations. According to the officer, such things, made by the hands of ordinary Ukrainians, are very motivated and needed by people on the front.
Volunteers from the Dnieper, Zaporizhzhia, Vinnitsa, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Yaremcha responded to the call of military journalists ... In a matter of days we gathered a considerable package with various souvenirs, charms and bracelets with patriotic symbols. Bracelets, yellow-blue hearts and even special drawings for psychological unloading-all this is already heading for the military unit. Also, with these souvenirs, journalists received a considerable amount of wicker zbabovovna and wool of special connections for fighters who lost their limbs as a result of Napoli's wounds. These things were transferred to the Lviv City City Center for Assistance to ATO/OOS participants.
 Recall that the "support of your" action, which was initiated by military journalists, has been operating since 2018. It can be a participant who wants to express moral support to our defenders at the front. Sign the flags with support for support, make postcards or amulets - and journalists Armyinformforming information groups working on the front will gladly transfer them to the outlive of fire, where our warriors defend their homeland from the enemy.
And once again we thank all the indifferent Ukrainians who continue to support the Armored Forces of Ukraine!Let's win together!
