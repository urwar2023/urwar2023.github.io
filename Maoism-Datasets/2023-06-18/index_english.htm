With the assistance of the United Tavriya defense forces, the Armyonform became known to be famous for how the analogue "alligator" followed the Russian military ship.</p>
<p>The pilot of the Russian helicopter quietly controlled the combat car. It was very confident that it was moving above the temporarily occupied territory of thawing below twenty meters, and the distance to Ukrainian positions was overwhelming. Performing the maneuvers at such a distance, the "Putin -screenwriting" felt almost invulnerable.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Marines, near the positions of which, had a Russian helicopter, were otherwise thought. The sub-air defense of a separate Marine Corps named after the counter-Admiralhail of Bilinsky performed the task of covering during counter-offensive. Marpich with a call sign "Summer" visually determined the target that was identified as a "Russian shock helicopter KA-52".</p>
<ul>
<li>And then everything they taught: I saw, hit, destroyed, - says Summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The missile, launched from Igla MSrk, hit the tail of the helicopter. Further, "summer", along with the brothers, watched a picturesque picture: praised "alligator", leaving behind the fatty thick smoke, began to lose its height sharply and disappeared from the field of view for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the observers who were in the infantry units of the brigade received confirmation of the affected target. The Alligator has fallen in a territory that is still under the control of the occupiers. So, another praised Russian "alligator" has turned into scrap, which spoils the amazing landscapes of the Ukrainian nature. "But this is a temporary phenomenon," our Marines say.</p>

<p>One of the suspects is the former operator of Odessa State Television, who, after a full-scale invasion, began to cooperate with the Russian TV channel-TV.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the attacker agreed to the order of the propagandists. For 8 thousand hryvnias, he was familiar with his acquaintance for the role of the "military" of the local center of acquisition.</p>

<p>This fake was aired by Russian Ren-TV, from where he was picked up by more than 20 propaganda information resources, including the largest federal tests.</p>
<p>SBU initiated psychological and linguistic examinations of this video confirmed the facts of criminal acts of the persons involved.</p>

<p>After a full -scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he actively called for the support of the collectors and justified their military crimes on his social networks. Thus, he got into the field of view of the Kremlin propagandists and entered with them VKontakte.</p>
<p>In the course of searches conducted by the defendants, the SBU operatives found and seized:</p>
<ul>
<li>mobile phones, computers, professional video equipment and electronic media with evidence of illegal activity; * draft records; * Acting requisite: military uniforms and grilling means.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, the Portuguese was in Croatia, where he worked with the club youth teams.</p>
<p>Edgar agreed with the Miners' management management on the termination of the contract, since Shakhtar decided to return youth teams to Kiev.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, I told the club that I would never return to Ukraine, and the war is in touch. The club, apparently, understood, made my decision and wanted to continue working with me on these conditions. My responsibilities were accompanied by all the teams that were in Croatia, and every time the team under 19 years or the main team went to European competitions or internships, in the summer or Christmas, I came from Croatia and accompanied them, ”Cardoza said.</p>
<p>He also noted that he decided not to return to Ukraine together with the Miners Academy.</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago, the club decided that all players and all teams would return in Ukraine, because the championships will start in September for all age groups, so despite having a current contract with Shakhtar until December 31, it is decided to return to Ukraine. Because it is dangerous. I want to be near the rise of the family again. My life credo - wherever I work, should be my deed, and it would be impossible in Ukraine. This is not my will, not the will of the club, but unfortunately, we have to go different ways. They are returning to Ukraine, and I do a new project, ”explained the former director of the Miners Academy.</p>

<p><em>Video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua">Presidential Office</a></em></p>
<p><strong> I wish health, dear Ukrainians!</strong></p>
<p>This week ends - it is very important to us all the week: for our defense, for our steps forward - for our offensive actions. And it is the time to see all our soldiers, those who distinguished themselves this week.</p>
<p>The Tavria direction is the harshest. Marines of the 35th Separate Brigade-thank you!Seventystyevika paratroopers - thank you!130th separate reconnaissance-thank you!68 Separate Eger Brigade-Thank you!23 Separate mechanized brigade-I am!Artillerymen of the 44th Brigade-I am grateful to you!</p>
<p>I will especially note the mouth of the percussion drones of the 47th separate mechanized Brigade, headed by the chief sergeant Rustam Mustafayev. Thank you for the result, warriors!The crew of the armored car demining the 70th Separate Support Regiment is the eldest sergeant Mykola Nikandrov and the junior sergeant Roman Lisin. Well done guys!</p>
<p>Our National Guard - Thank you all!And especially I will note Chief Sergeantvasil Kovilin and platoon commander Denis Zeleny, 4th Battalioperative Purpose, 1st Presidential Brigade of the National Guard. Thank you!The guys will be tasked with Luhansk region, under Bigorivka.</p>
<p>Our border guards… I will note especially Lutsk and Lviv borderlines. Senior Soldier Vasily Kutsyk, Avdiivskyi Direction - is very effective in picking the storms. Thank you!Sergeant Vadim wife, Siverskyi direction - successfully "minus" soldiers and equipment of the enemy. Thank you!</p>
<p>And of course, our defenders of the sky. In a week, more than a hundred group aviaries on the positions and rear of the enemy. Thank you, our pilots!In seven days, three dozen rockets and about fifty shock drones are destroyed. And separately celebrate the boobs of the sky of Kyiv region. 96th Kiev anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Air Force-thank you!All "calibers" and "daggers" were destroyed during these attacks, and therefore the lives of our people were saved.</p>
<p>And besides I want to say about a few things. First. No matter who, in Russia, he said that our "Petriots" are destroyed, they are all, they all work, the ADIns are knocking down Russian missiles. And knock down as efficiently as possible. No "Petriot" is destroyed!Third. As for the terrorist state, the only thing that has to worry them now is how to prepare their society, Russian society, to the fact that they will repay all that they will destroy their country's future. The enthusiastic territories of Russia will lose. There are no steps from de -occupation and will not be an alternative.</p>
<p>Our military is moving: position by position, step by step.</p>
<p>It was Ramstein this week, and most importantly, it is the speed of delivery. The next week there will be new important communications with partners - just for the sake of our Gourukh, just for the sake of weapons, just for the sake of our soldiers to be all -necessary.</p>
<p><strong> I thank everyone and everyone who is now in battle, on positions and on battlefields!</strong></p>
<p><strong> I thank everyone who helps!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong></p>

Neither the British government nor the European Commission will agree to such a step, while sanctions are in force against Russia through Vladimir's aggression <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin">Putin</a>Against Ukraine, " - it is a testament.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, despite the fact that Abramovich himself is under sanctions because of the proximity to Putin's regime, he must "sign" the transfer of these funds. Alyossi oligarch refused to do so, "because he wants the money to be developed between Russia and Ukraine."</p>
<p>The sources in the British Foreign Ministry confirmed the Daily Mail that the situation is now a samette, also pointing to the words of Minister James Kleverli, who last week to realize that there was no certainty that the money would be gone before the government was going to the next month. "We hope that the money will start coming in Ukraine before the harsh winter conditions come again, but there is no longer the guarantee that it will happen," Kleverla said.</p>
<p>It is reminded that Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea last year, knowing that sanctions were waiting for him. The US billionaire Todd has paid the pad of £ 2.5 billion, and after the expenses associated with the agreement, £ 2.3 billion remained.</p>
<p>These funds remain in a frozen bank account in the United Kingdom owned by Fordstam, controlled Abramovich, and the British Foreign Ministry gave green light to transfer this money.</p>

<p>Recently, the Portuguese was in Croatia, where he worked with the club youth teams.</p>
<p>Edgar agreed with the Miners' management management on the termination of the contract, since Shakhtar decided to return youth teams to Kiev.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, I told the club that I would never return to Ukraine, and the war is in touch. The club, apparently, understood, made my decision and wanted to continue working with me on these conditions. My responsibilities were accompanied by all the teams that were in Croatia, and every time the team under 19 years or the main team went to European competitions or internships, in the summer or Christmas, I came from Croatia and accompanied them, ”Cardoza said.</p>
<p>He also noted that he decided not to return to Ukraine together with the Miners Academy.</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago, the club decided that all players and all teams would return in Ukraine, because the championships will start in September for all age groups, so despite having a current contract with Shakhtar until December 31, it is decided to return to Ukraine. Because it is dangerous. I want to be near the rise of the family again. My life credo - wherever I work, should be my deed, and it would be impossible in Ukraine. This is not my will, not the will of the club, but unfortunately, we have to go different ways. They are returning to Ukraine, and I do a new project, ”explained the former director of the Miners Academy.</p>

Thank you for the result, warriors!The crew of the armored car demining the 70th Separate Support Regiment is the eldest sergeant Mykola Nikandrov and the junior sergeant Roman Lisin. Well done guys!</p>

<p>This was stated by a representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov during an interview with Anastasia Katerynchuk.</p>
<p>“A number of norms and standards of nuclear safety at the NPP is no longer provided by the current authorities. The fact that they are constantly producing with our Zaporizhzhya atomic station is a nuclear blackmail: it is also the placement of forces and means, weapons there; This is the implementation of shelling by rashists from the territory and in the territory of the lands; It is the terror of the power plant staff and many other factors, ” - said the representative of Ukraine's military intelligence.</p>
<p>According to Andriy Yusov, the blackmail on the ZPP and other occupied objects of critical infrastructure is related to the Russian awareness that the occupied territories of Ukraine will have to get out sooner or later.</p>
<p>“The main thing that every Ukrainian and the whole world must understand - in Kakhovka, named" Crimean Titan "and all over Ukraine, and environmental safety at these objects, will be guaranteed when they return under the control of Ukraine and legal power. While Russian terrorists are there, it will be threatened to preserve, ” - said the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Andriy Yusov noted that the enemy's statements about the possible placement of nuclear weapons of Storalier of Belarus is also an element of Moscow blackmail. At the same time, the anibilorrian dictator Lukashenko, nor any other in that country is able to influence the placement, use or fate of Russian nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“Of course, the people of Belarus once again are hostages, now an additional element of nuclear argument, nuclear blackmail. Something additional for NATO, for Ukraine, is not threatened. But Putin shows, they say, she will take some steps on the chessboard, ”Andrei Yusov explained, adding that the dances of Russians with nuclear tambourine in Belarus are expected.</p>
<p>“Despite all the dances with the tambourine, now the nuclear tambourine, for Ukraine, the important factor remains that Belarus is not drawn into full -scale terrestrial Russia against Ukraine, and this is not observed. They want to cover, wave their fists, threaten someone, threateningly move your mustache? - Well, Bellas, " - summed up a representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p>
