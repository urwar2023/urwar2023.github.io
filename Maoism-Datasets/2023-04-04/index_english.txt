About it reports Security Service of Ukraine.
To do this, he organized the launch of the FOENIX FSB controlled FSB on the basis of captured equipment of Ukrainian communication operators in the occupied districts of the region.
Subsequently, he facilitated the invaders in the forced "transfer" of the local residents of the Russian telephone network. In this way, the intelligence service of the aggressor country is obtained to the personal data of subscribers and information about their content.
In addition, the FSB uses a controlled telephone operator for the widening of SMS distributions with misinformation about the situation on the front and intra-political situation in the region.
Another attacker is the "Deputy Director" of the so -called "Unitary enterprise" DNR "of the Phoenix communication operator. It was he who helped the EMFSB staff to get full technological access to the mobile company telecommunications equipment.

 Today, the 74th anniversary of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Main and Political Union in the world, is marking the North Atlantic Alliance. NATO became the basis of a single system of Evro -Atlantic security from Canada to the Baltic countries. For Ukraine, membership of the Educational Alliance is one of the key goals of foreign policy. More about how NATO was created and about its present in the Army's Army.
After the end of World War II, Europe lay in ruins. The United States came out with a superpower, which created military bases on all continents. The warnings of the Western countries to take into account the lessons of the two world wars - that it was better to work with each other than to hostile, led to awareness of the most integration at the military level.
The initiative of the creation of a new union of states came from the United States and the United Kingdom. British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin contributed to the signing of the Brussels Treaty in 1948. The document created the Defense Alliance of Benilux countries(Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg), France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
After that, the conversations of the US, Canada and Britain began to create an Atlantic security system. The novelty of NATO was that the universal defense was committed by the US to the Allies in Europe. In the case of a conditional attack on France, US troops stationed by the Navara European Continent would come to the rescue.
 Signing the Vashington Agreement
On April 4, 1949, the Washington Agreement was signed in the US capital, which was consumed by a document that created the North Atlantic Alliance. However, active discussions between the three major countries - the United States, Great Britain and France - were foreseen.
Signing of Washington Agreement 
Paris saw the future of NATO as a global organization, and Washington and London planned the Alliance as the only security system in the Euro -Atlantic. Excellent views between the Allies were also the inclusion of colonies in collective protection. Then, in the late 1940s, European states were still colonial empire(https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67656.htm).
 Signature
Belgium proposed to mention the Congo, and France Algeria. After all, Algeria remained.* “On the territory of any of the parties in Europe or North America, at the Algerian Departments of France, in Turkey, or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropics of Cancer; * On the forces, vessels or planes of any side when they are in or above, or in any other zone in Europe, where the occupation forces of any of the parties were placed on the date when the contract was obtained validity, either in the Mediterranean, or the North Atlantic area north of the Cancer Tropics. "
The solemn signing of the NATO Establishment in Washington was the initial military-political union. The then US President Harry Truman was among those who saw in the North Atlantic Alliance the future of the safety of and the defense. Moreover, the Cold War began - a period of US struggle with a treacherous union. Europe was divided into opposing camps. By the way, Truminen was the author of the doctrine of restraint, which involved the active cooperation of the allies with the purpose of not widening communism in the world.
12 countries created the North Atlantic Alliance in 1949: the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Norway.
For military integration in NATO in 1951, the headquarters of the Supreme High Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europe was established. The first Supreme Chief Commander was the American General, the Hero of the First World War Taxer of Allies in World War II David Dauyt Eisenhower.
 Eisenhower and letter of its appointment
During the Cold War, NATO became the main outpost of the West in the struggle of the USSR. Although Timothy Andrews Sale notes, the author of the book "Strong Alliance: NATO's History and Global Post -war Order", the Alliance was more likely to be a direct threat to the Soviet invasion, and rather indirect interventions of the USSRSPAGANDS, intelligence. In other words, to influence the public opinion of Ukraine NATO on the placement of ballistic missiles or other operations of military work of allies.
The main principle of the Alliance was and remains the civil control of the military. NATO Gensions usually became the former defense ministers, foreign affairs of Chipremiers of Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Denmark.
 Marcaniederland in honor of the 40th anniversary of NATOIndeed, the period of the 1990s in the history of the Alliance has passed under the desire to attract the Komun communist states in cooperation. On the initiative of US President Billaclineton, in 1994, the NATO Peace Partnership Program was announced in 1994. Therefore, there was an atmosphere of the possibility of coexistence of the former supervisors - this concerned in particular Russia. But, as we saw later, the Kremlin did not give up its imperial complexes with the military invasion of other sovereign states.
At the same time, it was in the 1990s that the North Atlantic Alliance began to actively work with public diplomacy. The latter is to create a positive NATO abroad through informing about the activities of the organization for Ukrainian partners.
In 1997, key events of relations of Ukraine - NATO: 
· NATO Information and Documentation Center in Ukraine has been established;
· At the Madrid Summit, President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma signed KhartiyUkraine - NATO;
· A mission of Ukraine with NATO was opened at the Alliance headquarters.
On September 11, 2001, the US terrorist attacks were a turning point in NATO history. So the only time the 5th Article of the Washington Agreement was applied. On 7 October 2002, the United States launched an anti-terrorist operation against the Taliban Vaffganistan, which was joined by NATO Allies and Partner countries through acting contingents. Among these states was Ukraine. In the end, the most relevant in the history of the Alliance, which lasted 20 years, ended with the withdrawal of military in the summer of 2021.
In June 2020, Ukraine received the status of a partner with advanced opportunities. Although the cooperation of our country with the Alliance has been going on since the 1990s: joint military exercises, rehabilitation of Ukrainian military abroad, and the implementation of NATO standards in the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine.
 Ukraine Minister
After a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, a natively revised security strategy. In the new strategic concept of the Alliance, approved at the summit in Madrid in June 2022, Rosiybul was named "the main security threat to the Euro -Atlantic region."

 "So it happened that night. Using the peculiarities of the Shahheda launch, they began to use the relief of the coast and the coastal zone, in particular, the Bplabuli launched at a very low distance above water levels. This usually complicates their detection of air defense systems - stated Natalia Humeniuk, Head of the Joint Present Center of Southern Ukraine forces of Southern Ukraine, during the Non -New News Etherer.
In addition, the officer noted that the work of the defenders of the sky began simultaneously with a danger of air anxiety. This is due to the fact that the priority was devoted to combat work and then notified. Such cases are not often, but they still happen. This happens because of a very high system of systemPPO during massive attacks.
It is worth noting that the enemy's army aimed at several goals. It was directed in different directions. This indicates the probable tacticorosis of air defense forces. The efficiency of beating the southworks confuses the enemy, so they have not used tortoise or UAV for a long time.
Over the past 24 hours, the enemy army has struck three times with the managed aviation bombamiberislav and Kherson districts. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but such a lot of destruction is caused. Again, the invaders directed them to industry and agricultural land. This is to ensure that the region is not likely to develop and revive.

 About it the President of Ukraine said during their exception to a meeting with members of the National Association of Governor.
“Thank you very much for this opportunity!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Ambassador!
Dear representatives of all America - from the east coast to the western.
All the cities and communities of the United States are actually presented at this meeting, and honor for me - to contact you.
I just completed the trips to those regions of our country that are released by the Obrose Army or border with the fighting area.
All this is a tremendous territory. The line of active fighting in Ukraine is now over 1200 kilometers. It's like Washington, D.C., to Chicago and back!Front -footage - even larger.
Millions of people live in cities and villages, where we either have expelled the Russian label or are getting ready to expel.
Think about this number: nearly 1900 cities and villages of our country need to build.
Schools and churches, houses and enterprises, transport and power plants ... All of you are well aware of what is to restore the living conditions after the devastating tornado. You do it!We do it!But after the strokes of the human element, the human girlfriend, not natural cataclysm.
Ukraine's restoration will be the largest economic project in Europe for the lives for some generations.
And I believe that America will be with us in this reconstruction!Your companies, your working places ... Just as you are now with us in defense.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
To whom, not to you, the governors of the state, to know what really stands according to "reconstruction" and "defense".
This war has not been resolved against our country as against freedom in Europe in general. And when asked why America should help Ukraine in our defense, I answer: just look at reality.
Millions of Ukrainian families are torn by war, millions are forced to look for in other countries of protection against Russian terror. Hundreds of Ukrainian cities and villages in Spanius artillery, rockets, aviation and Iranian drones, which is used by Russia.
There was a city of coal. 15 thousand inhabitants. The aggressor burned it. Mariupol. More 400 thousand inhabitants. Russia left it only ruins.
Thousands of fields are replaced. Much of our economy is broken. Hundreds and hundreds of people by force deported to Russia ...How much will it cost America then?
The Kremlin dreams of humiliation of America, Europe, the whole free world ... The Kremlin dreamed of NATO, to provoke a conflict that will put your nation with a election: to fight or not. It is Ukraine that is now your reliable last limit, your reliable border ... Thanks to the Ukrainian strength, in particular, your people will not be able to make this choice - the choice for your men and women, brave men, whose lives would be laid on the altar of protection of the most valuable - freedom.
1200 kilometers of fighting in Ukraine. And how many plus it can be in Europe? Ukraine is able to prevent the expansion of war. It is able to defeat Russia on our land.
The enemy of freedom must lose quickly and reliably where he came from the criminal aggressive war. That is why we apply for the support of Parsh, weapons and finances. Ukraine stands - your peace, your allied partners will stand.
And I want to thank all the Americans - everyone and everyone, leaders and ordinary people who see this reality, who know how important it is to protect the freedom lashes that support Ukraine.
We are grateful to the President Biden, both parties and houses of Congress and every school that is now involved in the protection of freedom. I am grateful to those who are ready to work with us in reconstruction.
Thank you all. I thank the Arkansas and all the employees of the state defense industry wonderful Himars systems, which actually change the course of hostilities for the departure of the Russian army to the deaf defense.
I thank Alabami and all staff of state enterprises that produce, in particular, Javelin anti -tank systems that saved the lives of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers.
I thank Arizona and Oklahomi, where our military trained, in particular for Petriots. Thank you to every US state that is involved in the production of Petriots.
"Harpons" and "Silegers", "First" and "Bradley", other systems and products(Not safety), services and decisions that bring Ukrainian victory closer, give Ukrainian life stability despite the war, is your production, your states. Texas and Nevada, Maryland and California, Indiana and Oregon, tripodington and New York and many others ...
Each of the states already has experience of helping us. Not only defense, but also people, in particular in the treatment and rehabilitation of soldiers and civilians - adults of I -Ukrainian children who were injured by Russian terrorist strikes and mines.I know that individual states are negotiating special cooperation. Something is being restored. Ohio and our Kharkiv region, Illinois and Nashayiv region, Minnesota and our Chernihiv region. We have to expand such a direction of bilateral cooperation - from state to region, from the city of the house. What will supplement the interstate work powerfully.
It is with Ukraine that America has the opportunity to protect its values that are familiar with the famous ones. Our cooperation also creates a new growth for our safety, for our economy, for jobs in both of our countries.
The main thing is not to lose time, not to lose the chance we have. To act now, to help now. Ukrainians do so that the Americans do not have to fight. We get new strength for our states.
And I am sure that we will always be successful.
Thank you for attention!Thank you, America, for the right help that allows you to transmit!
I invite you who have not yet been in Ukraine, visit our country and see that our people's protection is the protection of our common dream of freedom and vide for everyone.
By the way, Mr. Governor Murphy, who visited the Lviv region in February, can confirm: We are a hospitable people and are always glad to visit an open heart.
Glory to the United States!
Glory to Ukraine!"

 I wish health, dear Ukrainians!
He just turned to the Chile Parliament - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we want. It doesn't matter what the distance between our peoples. We appreciate life and protect the international order. We must deprive the hope of support in Latin America.
He also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time such a special appeal to the representatives of each state elected by citizens. He thanked them with the suspension, emphasizing how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing killing, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore an indirect life after the strikes of aggression.
He spent several international conversations today, talking to our partners.
He thanked Canada and personally Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau for unchanged support. For its next manifestation - financial assistance of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. In detail, we discussed in the battlefield and the security needs of our country.
To reject the enemy from our earth and thus finish this faster, we have to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples, as they agree with the chaos that Russian aggression brings the world.
He spoke to Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps of Vevrointegration, our joint measures, which we are preparing… a new sanction packaging, which must continue the pressure line on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.
Today, by the way, a historic event for our region, for the whole of Europe, the entire Euro -Atlantic community. Finland becomes a 31st NATO member.
I congratulate the entire people of Finland and personally Mr. President. With a reliable guarantee of security - a collective guarantee.
Russian aggression clearly proves: only collective guarantees, only prerequisite guarantees can be reliable. This is what we have always talked about. We also talk about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. We in the infect, what can be the speed of procedures.
By the way, NATO Summit in Vilnius deserves to be quite ambitious.
There will be a day when security will be guaranteed for our country.All day we are preparing for international events planned for this week. They are important, bold, ambitious. As this is a rule for Ukraine.
We keep in control and the internal situation, in particular about spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. To break Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside - no one.
I thank everyone who is in battle for Ukraine!Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Marinka Takrasnogorovka, every hot direction ... I thank you, warriors!
Thank you all who help Ukraine!
I will note two decisions today.
The United States provides a 2 billion $ 600 million defense support package. The HIMARS Boobes for Air Defense, and Artillery, what is needed. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you, Congress, thank every American!
And the second solution. Today, the work of the Independent International Commission of the United Nations, which investigates Russian crimes against Ukrainians, has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the racists to the inevitable, fair responsibility.
Glory to Ukraine!
