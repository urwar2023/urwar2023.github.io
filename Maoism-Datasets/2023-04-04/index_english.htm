<p>About this during the presentation of the analytical report "Inter -Sectoral Cooperation: a lesson of the way to a sustainable society", which took place recently in Kiev, a director of the International Center for Defense and Security(ICDS)in Tallinn, Ministry of Estonia Ministry(1994)Indrek Kannik.</p>
<p>During the joint work of Estonia and Ukraine under the Stable Ukraine program, the International Defense and Security Center was investigated how Ukrainian -stateanation showed its stability under the conditions of a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation is important for our country, as well as for the whole of Europe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Among the Estonians, Ukraine's support probably exceeds 95 percent or even98. The question is about the Russian -speaking population of Estonia. There are approximately 40-50 percents definitely against this war and for Ukraine. 35-40% are those that are difficult to determine. They probably understand that Russia still does the wrong thing of Ukraine, but do not want to interfere and openly speak against aggression, because they have roots there. Those who do not support Ukraine and, unfortunately, are the open Putinists - about 15-20% of the Russian -speaking population. The reasons are different - from the propaganda of the Russian Federation to the Menalgia under the Soviet Union. I want to say that in Estonia a fairly large gap between generations. And if there are those who support the policies of the Russian Federation and Putin among the older Russian -speaking.</li>

<p>About it in your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9iHpJZFwug"></a>At the end of the 405th day of the full-scale war said President of Ukraine Vladimirzelensky, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://t.me/OP_UA/9174"></a><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>He just turned to the Chile Parliament - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we want. It doesn't matter what the distance between our peoples. We appreciate life and protect the international order. We must deprive the hope of support in Latin America.</p>
<p>He also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time such a special appeal to the representatives of each state. He thanked them with the suspension, emphasizing how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing killing, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore an indirect life after the strikes of aggression.</p>
<p>He spent several international conversations today, talking to our partners.</p>
<p>He thanked Canada and personally Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau for unchanged support. For its next manifestation - financial assistance of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. In detail, we discussed in the battlefield and the security needs of our country.</p>
<p>To reject the enemy from our earth and thus finish this faster, we have to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples, as they agree with the chaos that Russian aggression brings the world.</p>
<p>He spoke to Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps of Vevrointegration, our joint measures, which we are preparing ... a new sanction packing bush, which must continue the pressure line on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.</p>
<p>Today, by the way, a historic event for our region, for the whole of Europe, the entire Euro -Atlantic community. Finland becomes a 31st NATO member.</p>
<p>I congratulate the entire people of Finland and personally Mr. President. With reliable security guarantee - collective guarantee.</p>
<p>Russian aggression clearly proves: only collective guarantees, only prerequisite guarantees can be reliable. This is what we have always talked about. We also talk about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. We in the infect, what can be the speed of procedures.There will be a day when security will be guaranteed for our country.</p>
<p>He is constantly in connection with our commander who oppose the state-pursuer of Napoli battle. Today there was a special format of our military meeting. General Syrsky - regarding Bakhmut, Head, Head of GUR - in the general war situation. The Ministry of Defense - on the supply of ammunition and even more by the needs of our defenders. Decisions are already being implemented.</p>
<p>All day we are preparing for international events planned for this week. They are important, bold, ambitious. As this is a rule for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We keep in control and the internal situation, in particular about spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. To break Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside - no one.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who is in battle for Ukraine!Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Marinka Takrasnovrovka, every hot direction ... I thank you, warriors!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will note two decisions today.</p>
<p>The United States provides a 2 billion $ 600 million defense support package. The HIMARS Boobes for Air Defense, and Artillery, what is needed. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you, Congress, thank every American!</p>
<p>And the second solution. Today, the work of the Independent International Commission of the United Nations, which investigates Russian crimes against Ukrainians, has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the racists to the inevitable, fair responsibility.</p>
<p><strong><em>Glory to Ukraine!</em> </strong></p>

<p>About it in <a href="https://t.me/dmytro_lubinetzs/2057"></a>The Commissioner of Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets informed, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“In order for Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti"></a>They were not able to turn home, in Russia are involved in special services, ”he said.</p>
<p>In particular, according to him, the Russian Commissioner for the Rights of the Child Maria Lviv-Belov, who was "awarded" the ICS warrant for arrest for war crimes, during a present-day press conference for foreign media publicly declared that the Russian service had prevented the Ukrainian child.</p>
<p>According to Lubinets, it is a citizen of Ukraine, a 17-year-old Bogdanoremokhin, whom Russian soldiers were initially taken out of Mariupol to Donetsk, an apothis to the Russian Federation. At the same time, Bogdan has a sister in Ukraine, informed Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada said that the guy tried to return to Nabatkivshchyna on his own - he actually reached Belarus, but was detained by the Russian service and returned to the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“It is worth noting that this young man has Ukrainian citizenship. Therefore, the enforcement of it into the territory of the aggressor country is not "salvation", as it is noted by the Bielova, but a crime. This story is another public confession in the crimes committed - the abduction of Ukrainian children, ”said the head of the office.</p>

"We are working for this, but we will turn to the competent authorities for the above mentioned fact," - said Lubinets.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ombudsman informed that Lviv -Belova stated that in Russia, there was a special report on the work of this so -called institution for assistance to children who "touched" a "special military operation" - that is, a cynical attack on our country.</p>
<p>"I emphasize again that these are our Ukrainian children and Russia will answer each other," he wrote.</p>
<p>As it was reported, on March 24, Lubinets informed that the Ukrainian authorities had received signals from the Russians that the Russian Federation could start returning Ukrainian children to our country on a systematic basis.</p>

<p>This, as Ukrinform reports, follows from a new study <a href="http://www.ifw-kiel.de/de/themendossiers/krieg-gegen-die-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/"></a>, which is preparing a King Institute of the World Economy.</p>
<p>Compared to December 2022, there is a general decrease in the volume of new assistance promised to Ukraine. For a new period covered by the period, from January 16, on February 24, 2023, Ukraine was allocated 12.96 billion euros, with a significant part of these funds received only from a few donors. Thus, Japan Tasandaur countries in early 2023 promised to provide significant support to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The most notable are Scandinavian countries: Norway(1.11 billion euros, growth by 90%), Sweden(0.33 billion euros, plus 41%). Denmark(EUR 0.24 billion, plus 33%)Ifinland(EUR 0.56 billion, plus 165%).</p>
<p>Японія пообіцяла нову значну фінансову допомогу на суму 5,1 млрд євро увигляді позик, а Нідерланди пообіцяли 2,5 млрд євро, призначені, серед іншого,для нової системи Patriot для України.</p>
<p>Новим трендом у сфері надання допомоги <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ukraina"> </a>There is a "longer planning horizons". Previously, the aid obligations were short -term and it was difficult to predict. Only the connection has made an obligation for the whole budget year. Now other countries, such as Britain and the Netherlands, imitate this model, promising to provide in 2023 the same amount of assistance as in 2022. Norway has even announced a long -term program of support for Ukraine with financial and military assistance of approximately 7 billion euros over the next five years, according to the study.</p>
<p>“The trend towards one- or long-term planning of assistance to Ukraine is very positive. In 2022, the obligations were mostly inconsistent with taspecific. This is very complicated by budgetary and military planning in Ukraine. It is advisable that some Western governments are holding leadership in acceptance, ”said the head of the group who founded UkraineSupport Tracker, director of the Kristoftrebesh Khistoftrebsh Research Center.</p>

<p>About it in <a href="https://t.me/dmytro_lubinetzs/2057"></a>The Commissioner of Human Rights Dmitry Lubinets informed, Ukrinform reports.</p>
<p>“In order for Ukrainian <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-diti"></a>They were not able to turn home, in Russia are involved in special services, ”he said.</p>
<p>In particular, according to him, the Russian Commissioner for the Rights of the Child Maria Lviv-Belov, who was "awarded" the ICS warrant for arrest for war crimes, during a present-day press conference for foreign media publicly declared that the Russian service had prevented the Ukrainian child.</p>
<p>According to Lubinets, it is a citizen of Ukraine, a 17-year-old Bogdanoremokhin, whom Russian soldiers were initially taken out of Mariupol to Donetsk, an apothis to the Russian Federation. At the same time, Bogdan has a sister in Ukraine, informed Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada said that the guy tried to return to Nabatkivshchyna on his own - he actually reached Belarus, but was detained by the Russian service and returned to the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“It is worth noting that this young man has Ukrainian citizenship. Therefore, the enforcement of it into the territory of the aggressor country is not "salvation", as it is noted by the Bielova, but a crime. This story is another public confession in the crimes committed - the abduction of Ukrainian children, ”said the head of the office.</p>

<p>He just turned to the Chile Parliament - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we want. It doesn't matter what the distance between our peoples. We appreciate life and protect the international order. We must deprive the hope of support in Latin America.</p>
<p>He also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time such a special appeal to the representatives of each state. He thanked them with the suspension, emphasizing how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing killing, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore an indirect life after the strikes of aggression.</p>
<p>He spent several international conversations today, talking to our partners.</p>
<p>He thanked Canada and personally Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau for unchanged support. For its next manifestation - financial assistance of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. In detail, we discussed in the battlefield and the security needs of our country.</p>
<p>To reject the enemy from our earth and thus finish this faster, we have to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples, as they agree with the chaos that Russian aggression brings the world.</p>
<p>He spoke to Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps of Vevrointegration, our joint measures, which we are preparing ... a new sanction packing bush, which must continue the pressure line on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.</p>
<p>Today, by the way, a historic event for our region, for the whole of Europe, the entire Euro -Atlantic community. Finland becomes a 31st NATO member.</p>
<p>I congratulate the entire people of Finland and personally Mr. President. With reliable security guarantee - collective guarantee.</p>
<p>Russian aggression clearly proves: only collective guarantees, only prerequisite guarantees can be reliable. This is what we have always talked about. We also talk about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. We in the infect, what can be the speed of procedures.There will be a day when security will be guaranteed for our country.</p>

<p>All day we are preparing for international events planned for this week. They are important, bold, ambitious. As this is a rule for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We keep in control and the internal situation, in particular about spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. To break Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside - no one.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who is in battle for Ukraine!Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Marinka Takrasnovrovka, every hot direction ... I thank you, warriors!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will note two decisions today.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/1-10.jpg" />Today, the 74th anniversary of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Main and Political Union in the world, is marking the North Atlantic Alliance. NATO became the basis of a single system of Evro -Atlantic security from Canada to the Baltic countries. For Ukraine, membership of the Educational Alliance is one of the key goals of foreign policy. More about how NATO was created and about its present in the Army's Army.</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, Europe lay in ruins. The United States came out with a superpower, which created military bases on all continents. The warnings of the Western countries to take into account the lessons of the two world wars - that it was better to work with each other than to hostile, led to awareness of the most integration at the military level.</p>
<p>The initiative of the creation of a new union of states came from the United States and the United Kingdom. British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin contributed to the signing of the Brussels Treaty in 1948. The document created the Defense Alliance of Benilux countries(Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg), France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>After that, the conversations of the US, Canada and Britain began to create an Atlantic security system. The novelty of NATO was that the universal defense was committed by the US to the Allies in Europe. In the case of a conditional attack on France, US troops stationed by the Navara European Continent would come to the rescue.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/2-12.jpg" />Signing the Vashington Agreement</p>
<p>On April 4, 1949, the Washington Agreement was signed in the US capital, which was consumed by a document that created the North Atlantic Alliance. However, active discussions between the three major countries - the United States, Great Britain and France - were foreseen.</p>
<h3><strong> Signing of Washington Agreement </strong></h3>
<p>Paris saw the future of NATO as a global organization, and Washington and London planned the Alliance as the only security system in the Euro -Atlantic. Excellent views between the Allies were also the inclusion of colonies in collective protection. Then, in the late 1940s, European states were still colonial empire(https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67656.htm).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/3-9.jpg" />Signature</p>
<p>Belgium proposed to mention the Congo, and France Algeria. After all, Algeria remained.* “On the territory of any of the parties in Europe or North America, at the Algerian Departments of France, in Turkey, or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropics of Cancer; * On the forces, vessels or planes of any side when they are in or above, or in any other zone in Europe, where the occupation forces of any of the parties were placed on the date when the contract was obtained validity, either in the Mediterranean, or the North Atlantic area north of the Cancer Tropics. "</p>
<p>The solemn signing of the NATO Establishment in Washington was the initial military-political union. The then US President Harry Truman was among those who saw in the North Atlantic Alliance the future of the safety of and the defense. Moreover, the Cold War began - a period of US struggle with a treacherous union. Europe was divided into opposing camps. By the way, Truminen was the author of the doctrine of restraint, which involved the active cooperation of the allies with the purpose of not widening communism in the world.</p>
<p>12 countries created the North Atlantic Alliance in 1949: the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Norway.</p>
<p>For military integration in NATO in 1951, the headquarters of the Supreme High Commander -in -Chief of the United NATO Armed Forces in Europe was established. The first Supreme Chief Commander was the American General, the Hero of the First World War Taxer of Allies in World War II David Dauyt Eisenhower.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/4-8-scaled.jpg" />Eisenhower and letter of its appointment</p>
<p>During the Cold War, NATO became the main outpost of the West in the struggle of the USSR. Although Timothy Andrews Sale notes, the author of the book "Strong Alliance: NATO's History and Global Post -war Order", the Alliance was more likely to be a direct threat to the Soviet invasion, and rather indirect interventions of the USSRSPAGANDS, intelligence. In other words, to influence the public opinion of Ukraine NATO on the placement of ballistic missiles or other operations of military work of allies.</p>
<p>The main principle of the Alliance was and remains the civil control of the military. NATO Gensions usually became the former defense ministers, foreign affairs of Chipremiers of Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Denmark.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T68-00-00-04-00/5-7.jpg" />Marcaniederland in honor of the 40th anniversary of NATOIndeed, the period of the 1990s in the history of the Alliance has passed under the desire to attract the Komun communist states in cooperation. On the initiative of US President Billaclineton, in 1994, the NATO Peace Partnership Program was announced in 1994. Therefore, there was an atmosphere of the possibility of coexistence of the former supervisors - this concerned in particular Russia. But, as we saw later, the Kremlin did not give up its imperial complexes with the military invasion of other sovereign states.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was in the 1990s that the North Atlantic Alliance began to actively work with public diplomacy. The latter is to create a positive NATO abroad through informing about the activities of the organization for Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong> In 1997, key events of relations of Ukraine </strong> - <strong> NATO: </strong></p>
<p>· NATO Information and Documentation Center in Ukraine has been established;</p>
<p>· At the Madrid Summit, President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma signed KhartiyUkraine - NATO;</p>
<p>· A mission of Ukraine with NATO was opened at the Alliance headquarters.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2001, the US terrorist attacks were a turning point in NATO history. So the only time the 5th Article of the Washington Agreement was applied. On 7 October 2002, the United States launched an anti-terrorist operation against the Taliban Vaffganistan, which was joined by NATO Allies and Partner countries through acting contingents. Among these states was Ukraine. In the end, the most relevant in the history of the Alliance, which lasted 20 years, ended with the withdrawal of military in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>In June 2020, Ukraine received the status of a partner with advanced opportunities. Although the cooperation of our country with the Alliance has been going on since the 1990s: joint military exercises, rehabilitation of Ukrainian military abroad, and the implementation of NATO standards in the Security and Defense Sector of Ukraine.</p>

<p>After a large -scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, a natively revised security strategy. In the new strategic concept of the Alliance, approved at the summit in Madrid in June 2022, Rosiybul was named "the main security threat to the Euro -Atlantic region."</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T69-00-00-04-00/gumenyuk-rozpovila.jpg" />"So it happened that night. Using the peculiarities of the Shahheda launch, they began to use the relief of the coast and the coastal zone, in particular, the Bplabuli launched at a very low distance above water levels. This usually complicates their detection of air defense systems - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">stated</a>Natalia Humeniuk, Head of the Joint Present Center of Southern Ukraine forces of Southern Ukraine, during the Non -New News Etherer.</p>
<p>In addition, the officer noted that the work of the defenders of the sky began simultaneously with a danger of air anxiety. This is due to the fact that the priority was devoted to combat work and then notified. Such cases are not often, but they still happen. This happens because of a very high system of systemPPO during massive attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>I draw attention to the fact that the enemy launched 17 "Shahaned" in order for some of the outs to be distracted by the maneuver, and that our air defense worked on them, the bypassing maneuvers for hits into industry objects - Dodalakapitan and rank.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that the enemy's army aimed at several goals. It was directed in different directions. This indicates the probable tacticorosis of air defense forces. The efficiency of beating the southworks confuses the enemy, so they have not used tortoise or UAV for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>When they carry out the attack in our direction, they try to bypass Ukrainian air defense. We now record that Russians focus more attention to the enclosure of engineering structures and defense. Occupation troops are also strengthened by the Taxes of Defense, as they realize that they will soon take them, - said Natalia Humeniuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, the enemy army has struck three times with the managed aviation bombamiberislav and Kherson districts. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but such a lot of destruction is caused. Again, the invaders directed them to industry and agricultural land. This is to ensure that the region is not likely to develop and revive.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T72-00-00-04-00/photo_5287583321448105537_w-1-1.jpg" />Instructor Yevgeny Ivanytsky emphasized that there are no dangerous mines: "All minia or other explosive objects are made to hurt the human life of a person, or to disable equipment."</p>

<p>The instructor devoted most of the speech to mines that come in two types: anti -personnel and anti -transport(which are often called "anti -tank"). Ворогнерідко використовує їх комбіновано, коли потужна міна встановлюється на меншу— наприклад, ПММ-2 віджимної дії, яка спрацьовує, коли хтось намагаєтьсяприбрати протитранспортну міну, що лежить на видноті.</p>
<p>Більше ніж 50% травмування від вибухонебезпечних предметів становитьнеобережне поводження зі звичайними набоями до стрілецької зброї.</p>
<p>Також інструктор розповів про міни-метелики та міни-пелюстки, касетнібоєприпаси, про небезпечні, схожі на «болтики», детонатори, які спрацьовуютьвід вібрації та інші «подарунки», які окупанти залишають на звільненихтериторіях.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-04T72-00-00-04-00/photo_2023-04-04-15.17.40.jpg" />Valentina Bykov's instructor has specified that the territories of Ukraine will now set more than 180 thousand square kilometers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is about the territory of two Austria or four Swiss, - said Valentina. - The sappers have such statistics that at least 10 years of demining are required every year. So, count. The war is already underway and it does not end yet, that is, we will need 100 years in order to ensure that the whole territory of Ukraine is fully fully safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The norm of the sapper is a demining of 25-100 square meters. m per day.</p>
<p>In the second part of the training, children under the guidance of the Instructor of the Association of Saper Ukraine Valentina Bykova learned about the signs that the territory could be substantiated, also about the procedure for action during suspicious objects. Or a person who got into a minefield or even a wealthy injury. Girls and boys enthusiastically participated in discussing the proposed situations, actively discussing their actions in danger.</p>
<p>Researcher at the National Military History Museum of Ukraine Dmitrymakhtakhtarov, present at the meeting, spoke about the museum and suggested that students visit their institution to study dangerous representations in a safe environment: ammunition, mines, bombs, etc.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Lyceum Director Tatiana Yermak in a comment to the correspondent Armyinform said she considered such measures extremely important.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that lessons should be. At least where we are invited - we come, - said Ms. Tatiana. - Children have to socialize, they have been quarantined for a long time, nowadays - wartime. In addition, safety is one of the most important things that the school should teach.</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevance of the military chaplaincy began with the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in 2014. It was then that the priests began to go to the war zones as volunteers to support and assist the military and civilian population. The next stage of 2015–2016, when the priests came to the army of chaplains as civilians. However, the state could not provide all guarantees and rights for this person in the area of hostilities, which is where there should be a military cape. Be near the serviceman.

It was after the ancestral component invasion in 2022 began to be implemented by the official chaplaincy, which was created in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on the "Military Chaplaincy Service", which is directly subordinated to the head of the Armed Forces.</p>
<ul>
<li>At present, we have fundamental changes: a military chaplain is an officer. He is the military rank and position, he in his uniforms with his servicemen - this is the standard of most NATO countries. Like their structure, the other military chaplain is an assistant who performs the function of physical protection and weapons in his hands because our military chaplain is not a combatant. Therefore, the military chaplain always has an assistant. Now there are military chaplains in each breeze or a separate battalion, - said Alexeieshtreshuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also told that the main task that sets a organization is to meet the spiritual and religious needs of a serviceman.<em>Foto Dmitry Yurchenko</em></p>

<p>In this way, the enemy tries to "felt" our air defense to ideal, where we have stronger places, and where we are weaker, so they are attacked from various nations, in particular from the coast of the Azov Sea. About it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">stated</a>During the "Uniform News" Telelorphone, a spokesman for the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Yurignat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now they start much less drones. It is worth remembering the New Year's night. Then the enemy released a record 45 UAV on the territory of Ukraine, and the next one - 39. Then our air defense forces shot down all the "chess". We now see the lessactivity of the use of drones-Kamikadze. Nevertheless, Russia has the production of shock UAV-"Lancet-1", "Lancet-2", "Lancet-3" with different combat part. This is primarily the defenders in the leading positions. These drones are directed with a camera, they have an operator who tries to stress the armored equipment. Various protidias are already coming up against such UAVs, and Ukrainian defenders are trying to destroy them, - an emphasis.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Shaksa's night attack on Odesa region, these unmanned aircraft are designed to fly as low as possible. They are hidden from radar stations, thus difficult to detect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each drone can be programmed to a certain flight height and a route. Odessa is the Black Sea, so enemy troops have the opportunity to customize "Shahda" to the water surface. After all, when they fly to land, they are still destroyed by our anti-aircraft missile forces, ”Colonel Yurignat added.</li>

<ul>
<li>These bombs pose a serious threat, because they can overcome the distance of up to 70 km. This depends on the height at which the aircraft rises. The higher the aircraft, the bomb will fly, because it is equipped with wings - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY8sDvZdWEA">told</a>Colonel Yuriy Ignati, spokesman for the Air Force forces of Ukraine during the "Uniform News" TEMACHAFON.</li>
</ul>
<p>The weight of such aviation bombs is 500 kg, which makes them quite powerful. If the enemy will use such ammunition, it can lead to the destruction of entire cities.</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw that the enemy did with Mariupol these bombs. Of course, they were not planning, but free fall, but unfortunately, at that time there was no Ukrainian air defense. Therefore, the occupation troops did everything they wanted with our city, ”the officer added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our defenders understand that the use of such planning bombing by the enemy will be new threats. They will not fly as accurately as the enemy would like, but over time, occupiers can refine it. Therefore, the risk remains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if these bombs get 20 or 30 kilometers from the line, it is still a very serious threat to our military personnel and prifrontoe cities. Three things that could drive away hostile planes from our border are Patriot, SAMP \ T and F-16 fighters. Unfortunately, we do not have any of the above equipment yet. Of course, Patriot Tasamp \ t will come to Ukraine soon, but we need to continue to tell the world, we need modern fighters, - said Colonel Yuri Ignat.</li>

<p>About it during a roundtable at the Military Media Center “Officers without weapons. The Institute of Military Chaplaincy in Ukraine: formation, mission, ecumenism” told Colonel Alexei Tereshchuk, Head of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Head of the Military Chaplaincy Service reported that according to the current law, a military chaplain may be a citizen of Ukraine, a representative of a religious organization that is registered in Ukraine in accordance with the current entry and has a mandate for the implementation of military-Kamplean activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>A mandate is like a license that is issued according to the need. The Armed Forces conducted a personnel survey and the quotas of the denominational representation of the military chaplains were determined. According to these quotas, each religious organization receives a request from the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedoms on the number of priests they should be delegated to the armed forces. They receive a mandate responsibly, and this enables them to carry out military-capeclarship activities,-said Alexei Tereshchuk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> He noted that there are 738 positions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As of today, the mandates have been issued to 244 clergymen, and 78 officers have been assigned to the staffing military chaplains. </strong> **</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the mandate does not yet indicate that the priest is immediately a become a military chaplain. There is a certain procedure, and today 78 -staffed military chaplains have been appointed, which received the military rank and signed the Contract. After appointment to the post, a military chaplain undergoes a special training. The preparation is not only in the pastoral care of or educational work, but also counseling, especially the commander, - said Alexei Tereshchuk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The head of the military chaplaincy said that consulting is commanding a very important area of work of the Chaplain.</p>
<p>-When the unit enters the area of combat mission, as shown by the practitioner, it is very important for the commander to understand the spiritual and religious situation in the districts and among his personnel. In 2014, there were even cases where our crews on the streets stopped civilians with signs of religious surgical. This is a very important work of the military chaplain, ”Alexei Tereshchuk reported.</p>
<p>The event also noted that the military chaplain should meet the spiritual and religious needs of the personnel and, if necessary, involve a representative of another religious denomination.</p>

<p>Deputy Minister <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/614">reported</a>In her technology, that the technology of information campaigns regarding the "story" and conscript was always the same.</p>
<p>"To spin a story where the announcement was discharged with a disabled person, the deceased, the absence of World War II. The hero is always different, it is about the essence.</p>
<p>Or they distributed some wild text of the summons or questionnaire of the conscript.</p>
<p>We regularly denied it.</p>
<p>Now the enemy has a little complicated by its technology and adds stories about the amazing place of handing stories and "waves" of mobilization.</p>
<p>The goal is obvious. Discredit and disrupt the work of the shopping mall(Former troops).</p>
<p>Маніпулювати вони намагаються на двох речах:</p>
<p>🔹страх отримання повістки</p>
<p>🔹формування суспільного осуду до роботи ТЦК СП</p>
<p>Але після широкомасштабного вторгнення цими Іпсо важко на щось чи на когосьвплинути.</p>
<p>Бо перелякати повістками після всього, що ми пройшли за цей рік, — важко.</p>
<p>На кону — держава, і всі це розуміють.</p>
<p>Що ж стосується осуду роботи ТЦК СП. Ми мусимо розуміти кілька речей.</p>
<p>✔️ ТЦК СП(the army)Today, the problem is strategically important for the defense.</p>
<p>✔️ They work live people and they can be mistaken or even commit. In such cases, it is necessary to act legal.</p>
<p>☝️ And the main thing is that you should not make sensations and loud headlines.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for this opportunity!</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>Ambassador!</p>
<p>Dear representatives of all America - from the east coast to the western.</p>
<p>All the cities and communities of the United States are actually presented at this meeting, and honor for me - to contact you.</p>
<p>I just completed the trips to those regions of our country that are released by the Obrose Army or border with the fighting area.</p>
<p>All this is a tremendous territory. The line of active fighting in Ukraine is now over 1200 kilometers. It's like Washington, D.C., to Chicago and back!Front -footage - even larger.</p>
<p>Millions of people live in cities and villages, where we either have expelled the Russian label or are getting ready to expel.</p>
<p>Think about this number: nearly 1900 cities and villages of our country need to build.</p>
<p>Schools and churches, houses and enterprises, transport and power plants ... All of you are well aware of what is to restore the living conditions after the devastating tornado. You do it!We do it!But after the strokes of the human element, the human girlfriend, not natural cataclysm.</p>
<p>Ukraine's restoration will be the largest economic project in Europe for the lives for some generations.</p>
<p>And I believe that America will be with us in this reconstruction!Your companies, your working places ... Just as you are now with us in defense.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
<p>To whom, not to you, the governors of the state, to know what really stands according to "reconstruction" and "defense".</p>
<p>This war has not been resolved against our country as against freedom in Europe in general. And when asked why America should help Ukraine in our defense, I answer: just look at reality.</p>
<p>Millions of Ukrainian families are torn by war, millions are forced to look for in other countries of protection against Russian terror. Hundreds of Ukrainian cities and villages in Spanius artillery, rockets, aviation and Iranian drones, which is used by Russia.</p>
<p>There was a city of coal. 15 thousand inhabitants. The aggressor burned it. Mariupol. More 400 thousand inhabitants. Russia left it only ruins.</p>
<p>Thousands of fields are replaced. Much of our economy is broken. Hundreds and hundreds of people by force deported to Russia ...How much will it cost America then?</p>
<p>The Kremlin dreams of humiliation of America, Europe, the whole free world ... The Kremlin dreamed of NATO, to provoke a conflict that will put your nation with a election: to fight or not. It is Ukraine that is now your reliable last limit, your reliable border ... Thanks to the Ukrainian strength, in particular, your people will not be able to make this choice - the choice for your men and women, brave men, whose lives would be laid on the altar of protection of the most valuable - freedom.</p>
<p>1200 kilometers of fighting in Ukraine. And how many plus it can be in Europe? Ukraine is able to prevent the expansion of war. It is able to defeat Russia on our land.</p>
<p>The enemy of freedom must lose quickly and reliably where he came from the criminal aggressive war. That is why we apply for the support of Parsh, weapons and finances. Ukraine stands - your peace, your allied partners will stand.</p>
<p>And I want to thank all the Americans - everyone and everyone, leaders and ordinary people who see this reality, who know how important it is to protect the freedom lashes that support Ukraine.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the President Biden, both parties and houses of Congress and every school that is now involved in the protection of freedom. I am grateful to those who are ready to work with us in reconstruction.</p>
<p>Thank you all. I thank the Arkansas and all the employees of the state defense industry wonderful Himars systems, which actually change the course of hostilities for the departure of the Russian army to the deaf defense.</p>
<p>I thank Alabami and all staff of state enterprises that produce, in particular, Javelin anti -tank systems that saved the lives of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
<p>I thank Arizona and Oklahomi, where our military trained, in particular for Petriots. Thank you to every US state that is involved in the production of Petriots.</p>
<p>"Harpons" and "Silegers", "First" and "Bradley", other systems and products(Not safety), services and decisions that bring Ukrainian victory closer, give Ukrainian life stability despite the war, is your production, your states. Texas and Nevada, Maryland and California, Indiana and Oregon, tripodington and New York and many others ...</p>
<p>Each of the states already has experience of helping us. Not only defense, but also people, in particular in the treatment and rehabilitation of soldiers and civilians - adults of I -Ukrainian children who were injured by Russian terrorist strikes and mines.I know that individual states are negotiating special cooperation. Something is being restored. Ohio and our Kharkiv region, Illinois and Nashayiv region, Minnesota and our Chernihiv region. We have to expand such a direction of bilateral cooperation - from state to region, from the city of the house. What will supplement the interstate work powerfully.</p>
<p>It is with Ukraine that America has the opportunity to protect its values that are familiar with the famous ones. Our cooperation also creates a new growth for our safety, for our economy, for jobs in both of our countries.</p>
<p>The main thing is not to lose time, not to lose the chance we have. To act now, to help now. Ukrainians do so that the Americans do not have to fight. We get new strength for our states.</p>
<p>And I am sure that we will always be successful.</p>
<p>Thank you for attention!Thank you, America, for the right help that allows you to transmit!</p>
<p>I invite you who have not yet been in Ukraine, visit our country and see that our people's protection is the protection of our common dream of freedom and vide for everyone.</p>
<p>By the way, Mr. Governor Murphy, who visited the Lviv region in February, can confirm: We are a hospitable people and are always glad to visit an open heart.</p>
<p>Glory to the United States!</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!"</p>

<p>He just turned to the Chile Parliament - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we want. It doesn't matter what the distance between our peoples. We appreciate life and protect the international order. We must deprive the hope of support in Latin America.</p>
<p>He also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time such a special appeal to the representatives of each state elected by citizens. He thanked them with the suspension, emphasizing how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing killing, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore an indirect life after the strikes of aggression.</p>
<p>He spent several international conversations today, talking to our partners.</p>
<p>He thanked Canada and personally Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau for unchanged support. For its next manifestation - financial assistance of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. In detail, we discussed in the battlefield and the security needs of our country.</p>
<p>To reject the enemy from our earth and thus finish this faster, we have to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples, as they agree with the chaos that Russian aggression brings the world.</p>
<p>He spoke to Ursula von Der Lyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps of Vevrointegration, our joint measures, which we are preparing… a new sanction packaging, which must continue the pressure line on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.</p>
<p>Today, by the way, a historic event for our region, for the whole of Europe, the entire Euro -Atlantic community. Finland becomes a 31st NATO member.</p>
<p>I congratulate the entire people of Finland and personally Mr. President. With a reliable guarantee of security - a collective guarantee.</p>
<p>Russian aggression clearly proves: only collective guarantees, only prerequisite guarantees can be reliable. This is what we have always talked about. We also talk about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. We in the infect, what can be the speed of procedures.</p>
<p>By the way, NATO Summit in Vilnius deserves to be quite ambitious.</p>
<p>There will be a day when security will be guaranteed for our country.All day we are preparing for international events planned for this week. They are important, bold, ambitious. As this is a rule for Ukraine.</p>
<p>We keep in control and the internal situation, in particular about spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. To break Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside - no one.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who is in battle for Ukraine!Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Marinka Takrasnogorovka, every hot direction ... I thank you, warriors!</p>
<p>Thank you all who help Ukraine!</p>
<p>I will note two decisions today.</p>
<p>The United States provides a 2 billion $ 600 million defense support package. The HIMARS Boobes for Air Defense, and Artillery, what is needed. Thank you, Pan -President Biden, thank you, Congress, thank every American!</p>
<p>And the second solution. Today, the work of the Independent International Commission of the United Nations, which investigates Russian crimes against Ukrainians, has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the racists to the inevitable, fair responsibility.</p>
<p>Glory to Ukraine!</p>

<p>Ukrinform reports with reference to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/04/nyregion/trump-arrest-arraignment#trump-is-expected-to-turn-himself-in-and-be-arraigned-today-heres-what-to-know"></a>.</p>
<p>The case, violated by the District Prosecutor of Manhattan Elvin Bragg, concerns the submission of false documents - a crime of low gravity, for which there is a punishment of up to four years of imprisonment, is also possible.</p>

<p>Tabloid made another payment of the partner of the year according to Playboy magazine in 1998 Karen McDugal, who wanted to sell her story about a novel with Trump during the 2016 election campaign. She concluded an agreement for $ 150,000 with a Zatabloid who bought the rights to her history to hide her.</p>
<p>The last payment, which is focused in the indictment, concerns an agreement worth $ 130,000 between Trump's mediator Michaelkoen and the porn star Stormy Daniels, enclosed in the last days of the election campaign. The payment, which, according to Cohen, made at the instructions of Trump, guaranteed that Daniels would not publish his story about sexual connection from the outstanding one.</p>
<p>Trump reimbursed Cohen's losses, and falsifying the relevant documents is a fracture, prosecutors say. In internal documents, the Trump company indicated the payment of Cohen as legal expenses, referring to the previous cost of the fee. However, as the investigation revealed, there was no such cost, and the agreement on the fee was also fictitious.</p>
<p>Trump denies all the offenses as well as any sexual contact with a porter.</p>
