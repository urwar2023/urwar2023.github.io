 Greetings to the graduates of the Taras Shevchenko Military Institute, Braian Menness, a maider-Major of Liberty Fort, the United States Armed Forces.
I want to express my gratitude to the brigade General Anatoliishevchenko for the opportunity to share with you a few tips, as Vasaclas prepares graduates who, while risking their own lives, take on a sensotement to perform tasks that will undoubtedly help protect Ukraine.
I recently dismissed the deputy commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. At one time, we were a unit of the US Armed Forces, which supported the Armed Forces of Ukraine from February to December 2022. The armeds of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine were incredibly impressed by us.
In 2000, more than 23 years ago, I participated in one of the first exercises with the program "Partnership for Peace" in the west of Ukraine, near Lviv, he drew for joint strategic planning together with the then commander of the Armed Forces, Colonel Ivan Yakubts. For me, this was a good experience. Comparing the condition of your army then and now, I am amazed at how much the armed forces of Ukraine have strengthened, in particular, thanks to such co -wanders as you.
More than 35 years ago, I graduated from the Academy in the West Point. Among the Academy's immigrants, there is a belief that if the release ceremony rains, the graduates will be war. In our case, the belief has come true. For more than five years, he managed the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also answered for planning the actions of the combined command of special operations of the efficiency of the deployment in these countries. He also performed the duties of the battalion and brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division, the first Ranger battalion and the 10th Mountain Division Commander.
I acknowledge that I did not have such combat experience as the one that is obtained in Ukraine, however, I am deeply convinced that there are inviolability that commanders should possess:* be technically aware. Commanders should be experts in their field;
The world is not in place, as well as the challenges we face. Commanders should be open to new knowledge, master new tactics, technologies of Tastrategy. The training should be continuous.
And most importantly, commanders should be true to their country and always hold their word. The devotion and purpose of military service should not be in doubt.
Your main motivation should be to protect and defend the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine. In difficult times, military duty and protection of your country are the main call. You are all doing right if you enjoy the time spent on the service. Be careful to the servicemen and educate the subordinates who will appreciate your command qualities.
The power of the army is in its unity. Successful completion of the task is always a common mate.
Finally, take the time to remember those who served us to be sacrificial immune and invaluable experience of which is now an important lesson for us. Honor them do their best to preserve the principles they fought for. I will consider that you will be guided by these tips during your service. Beat, strong and worthy.
Thank you for the opportunity to greet you. I really admire you!Good health to you!I pray that one day in Ukraine there will be peace.

“In the war, it is important to understand what is happening on the battlefield and to propose technological solutions. We see how the situation on the front changes in direction. How important are UAVs, satellite communications, situational identity systems. The picture of the battle changes. Fast decisions need to be made to realize effective ideas. It is now critically important to create alternative counteraction to Iranian Shahaned. We have cool cases with the army of drones, when not only foreign drones, but also UAVs of domestic production were supplied to the front. Similar to the development of systems of protection of the Ukrainian sky, ”said the Vice Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology-Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov.
The winners of the drone hackathon "Anti-Shahed" will conclude contracts for 1 million donors. The funds will go to the development of development as soon as possible, which destroy the wicked drones in the Ukrainian sky. New technologies will help fight stars Shahas so that you do not spend powerful resources for the Air Force.
“In fact, the Ukrainian infrastructure is being attacked by Iranian drones. Only at least 400 Shahaneda has been launched in May. In total, at least 1,200 percussion was launched in Ukraine last year. Ukrainian experts are able to amaze the world and efficiently counteract. Our task is to support the developers, to create speeches for mass production of alternative systems of counteraction to Iranian shivedam, ”-said Oleksandr Kubrakov, Vice Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine-Minister of Development of Ukraine-Minister of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure.That is why it is critical to us to create alternatives to counteracting Iranian shivedam.

I am sure that every idea proposed by Nahaktone has every chance of working for victory, ”Vladimir Koval, General General of Ukraine, said.
“When a new modern idea is being put into practice, it is an effective surprise for our enemy. According to available information on the territory of Russian, UAV production plants are actively built, and therefore the percentage of new Dronovpovp attacks will increase. With each attack, the enemy analyzes his or her bug works constantly on changing tactics. Therefore, the first thing that can be implemented as quickly as possible is the system of detection of enemy drones and, of course, their prompt destruction, ”said Anatoliy Krivonozhko, Lieutenant General, Commander-General, Commander-in-Chief of the Center.
“Every great war sets new trends in the development of military technologies. First -Ass to create a war of tanks. The second is aviation. This war has shown that the wars of unmanned aerial vehicles will take place at the next decades. That is why we need to create these modern technologies to overcome the enemy on the front today and to protect our territories in the closest, ”said Yuri Shchigol, Head of the State Secretariat of Communications.
We will remind, earlier within the army of drones we have already held the first Drone Hackathon.The 30 formed teams, which presented technological solutions in the development of the BLPL, 6 became winners. In half a year, they embodied their ideas into a product that was repaired at the landfill.

 The fact that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his entourage was represented as a strength of the system for years was the greatest weakness.
This opinion was expressed by the expert of the German Council on Foreign Relations Stefanmaster when communicating with foreign journalists in Berlin, Ukrinform reports.
According to the master, the attempt of the putty, arranged by the last weekend of Eugene and PVC "Wagner", showed the full "weakness of the Putin system, which is being drawn around one person, personalized."
The authorities, having lost, and temporarily, monopoly on violence, was not able to negotiate, for a few hours the country lost its administration: all the awaiting what will say [Putin].(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin), and "he looked as if he did not understand what was happening, he was weak, far from reality."
“If Putin does not respond, the system flows into chaos. The system is not flexible enough to respond to the force majeure, ”the expert summarized. He believes that "the incredible loss of prestige for Putin, which is very difficult for him, and the entire system is weakened."
As for Wagner PEC, it will not play an important Important in the war, says the master, this army is no longer powerful as before. The expert is also reported that the model of private companies, started in 2014 to conduct hybrid operations, exhausted itself, lost its relevance during the real war and the system was sooner or later punished by Prigogine and taken under control.
Putin, in turn, obviously wants to demonstrate even stronger determination, but also exacerbate repression within the country.

He called this "German fear" a problem. But today's Russian federation is not the USSR in the 1980s. In a table of a highly stanged systematic system in the Russian Federation, it can very quickly get to the putty, "faster than everyone could imagine."
We will remind, last weekend of PEC "Wagner" went a march to Moscow, but in a few hours she stopped her advancement, explaining it by the reluctance of shedding.

 The Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigogin is not an independent figure, behind him are people in the way, who seek to change the leadership of the Russian Federation.
According to Ukrinform, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexei Danilov said this on the air of the nationwide television.
“I can't agree that it was a performance, it was a real fighting, barefoot when the whole world saw that Putin was not the leader of the country, all, as Shchuri, fled from Moscow, fled urgently as soon could not influence, and for Russia It will have enormous consequences. First, I want to say that Prigogine himself is not an independent figure, behind him stands in shoulder straps, and this is quite clear today, it was not his own desire to go somewhere, he clearly under control. But if he was under Putin -controlled earlier, then this control of Putin is already lost, he is in a common, relatively speaking, the group with other persons whose goal today is the issue of replacing the leadership of the Russian Federation, ”Danilov said.
According to Danilov, some representatives of the Russian political elite understand that there are no ability to win in the war with Ukraine, and they will prepare a certain basis to depart from this situation.
Responding to the question of whether the "second season" of rebellion in Russia, the Secretarrhrnbo noted: “There will be more than one season, not as quickly as we would like, but the process began and yesterday there was a continuation. Yesterday's performance of the Kremlin Shchur(Vladimir Putin - Ed.)With a statement that was to outline the "future", she was so strange - he thanked the people who killed Russian. It goes beyond any understanding. "
Danilov added that the consequences of Prigogine's hike will definitely be.
“The consequences will be. The whole world has seen that Russia as such a managed country is not existing, it is a very dangerous territory and we will continue to observe. I cannot say whether they will go out and remove the masks now, to worry about Putin's mussing, but the fact that the people who participated in this were in the Kremlin are clear, ”Danilov said that it was a bold -specific operation to discredit Putin.
According to the Secretary of the NSDC, there are some reasons that the Wagnets did not reach 200 KMDO Moscow.*!(https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/3728184-ssa-trimali-u-taemnici-rozviddani-pro-plani-zakolotu-prigozina-vid-bilsosti-souznikiv-cnn.html)He also reported that Putin's protection is significantly strengthened and even the injection of members of the Russian Council in the room is guarded, which has never been earlier.
As reported Ukrinform , the leader of the Wagner PEC Yevhen Prigogin announced Demarsh of the Anti -Russian Military leadership on June 23, in particular against the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergiyashah.
Oleksandr Lukashenko negotiated with Prigogin, after which he stated that the groups of the group return to the field camps. On Tuesday, Lukashenko approved the arrival of Prigogine in Belarus.
Polish President Andrzej Duda believes that the movement of Wagner PEC and her leader of Prigogine to Belarus is “ a very negative signal ”.

 The fact that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his entourage was represented as a strength of the system for years was the greatest weakness.
This opinion was expressed by the expert of the German Council on Foreign Relations Stefanmaster when communicating with foreign journalists in Berlin, Ukrinform reports.
According to the master, the attempt of the putty, arranged by the last weekend of Eugene and PVC "Wagner", showed the full "weakness of the Putin system, which is being drawn around one person, personalized."
The authorities, having lost, and temporarily, monopoly on violence, was not able to negotiate, for a few hours the country lost its administration: all the awaiting what will say [Putin].(https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-putin), and "he looked as if he did not understand what was happening, he was weak, far from reality."
“If Putin does not respond, the system flows into chaos. The system is not flexible enough to respond to the force majeure, ”the expert summarized. He believes that "the incredible loss of prestige for Putin, which is very difficult for him, and the entire system is weakened."
As for Wagner PEC, it will not play an important Important in the war, says the master, this army is no longer powerful as before. The expert is also reported that the model of private companies, started in 2014 to conduct hybrid operations, exhausted itself, lost its relevance during the real war and the system was sooner or later punished by Prigogine and taken under control.
Putin, in turn, obviously wants to demonstrate even stronger determination, but also exacerbate repression within the country.

He called this "German fear" a problem. But today's Russian federation is not the USSR in the 1980s. In a table of a highly stanged systematic system in the Russian Federation, it can very quickly get to the putty, "faster than everyone could imagine."
We will remind, last weekend of PEC "Wagner" went a march to Moscow, but in a few hours she stopped her advancement, explaining it by the reluctance of shedding.

 Thus, the researcher says, according to the searches, it is a plane Fw190 modification of A6, lost on July 16, 1944. The pilot is a lieutenant Hans Press, it is considered missing.

Unfortunately, Ukraine became the scene of both world wars, and today the greatest war after the Second World War continues in its territory. And there are also whipped aircraft and other aircraft - both hostile and ours. Of course, times are other, and with the least possibility, their fragments and, in the cuttings, pilots are taken away. So the coming generation of searchmen, unlike Andrei Kiryanov and his like -minded people, will have less work. We will hope for it.
 As for the community of searchmen itself, they have a large -scale war, like all Ukrainians in general, broke their plans and changed their lives. According to Andriykiryanov, many of them went to defend the country. The rest were involved in Privature. And one of its directions was the organization for the willing commercial hikes in the mountains - hiking with excavations in interesting places, where during the Second World War there were accidents. The project has been put into practice, and the result was and continued to be added to the Armed Forces and the targeted assistance of the search engines with specific units of the Ukrainian army. But this is a topical story.

 The Coordination Headquarters met with the families of missing persons of the military personnel of the Separate Marine Infantry Brigade named after Mikhail Bilynsky. Native and close defenders are interested in the recovery of exchange algorithms.
About it reports Coordination headquarters of inquiries for the treatment of prisoners of war.
The coordination headquarters explained that the aggressor country does not have an authorized structure that would exchange prisoners of war, so each exchange is a separate operation of Ukrainian special services. It is impossible to talk about clearly defined algorithms in this context.
The expert also noted that the work on the exchange on the principle of "not all" is slow, but is moving.
“We have already taken the initiative and gave the Russians without any conditions of five. They, in turn, later gave their own initiative. However, this does not mean that if we give tomorrow, conditionally, a hundred of their wounded, we will get the same number of ours. There is no guarantee at this time, ”the expert said.
The coordination headquarters also drew attention to the fact that the disadvantage of the stay of our defenders and defenders in captivity are public and can be provided even by close relatives. At the same time, the headquarters can notify the departments of the prisoners' maintenance - such data will be displayed in the Personal Office. Staff experts try to track the movement of prisoners in places in Russia, but it is always possible to do it promptly and accurately.
"Sometimes even their Ministry of Defense does not know where one or the other is located," the headquarters representative emphasized.
The coordination staff staff also emphasized that the enemy continues to carry out information and psychological special operations regarding relatives of government. In particular, the Russians deliberately disseminate information of the intersection of a defender in a particular colony, although it is not in fact.
The coordination headquarters again emphasizes the need to use only official information from authorized persons and institutions.

 _ The Ukrainian army is increasingly moving away from outdated Soviet management methods, mastering the latest domestic developments. Remember, for example, the introduction of a protected combat system of management of the tactical link "Nettle", without which no combat unit now does? Now the Armed Forces have every chance of weaponing another unique development _ — an automated and remote control system of artillery intelligence barak , which cannot be detected by any technical means. And this is because it gives a clear "tight" of the coordinates of the work of even a large caliber -gun at a distance of 12 km, and mortars and artillery — ** _ up to 30 km.
Correspondent Armyinform He had a conversation about this development with the chief of artillery of one of the individual infantry brigades that nowadays the invaders in the Donetsk direction. Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Podvysotsky Testatta helps to improve the truly unique invention of his author and his large team of like -minded people for almost a year. According to him, the development is already practical to wide use in the Armed Forces.
 *!
Honestly, I did not believe at first that barak would work effectively when a team of like -minded people and colleagues of the inventor with some thamphon and microphones came to the front. But we urgently needed some new tool of artillery intelligence, first of all, for an effective counter -battery fight against the enemy. Therefore, we joined their work, and in the summer of Odessa we were given to us for testing a pilot version of the complex barak .
 The first version of the barracks
But at the moment we have reached the next. Now we are filled with accurate coordinating articles and individual enemy guns at distances of up to 30 kilometers. We have the most accurate data if we fire from distances of U18-24 kilometers. We spend no more than five seconds on "sampling". After that, with the help of barak operators, we compare our data with the data of our "birds", which are almost constantly spreading in the sky and are with operators_Barak_ on direct communication online, information from tactical intelligence, we get the same coordinates of goals.
Mr. Vitaliy, what is this complex physically? 
It is easy to work, does not require large human or material costs. Physically, it is eight, and, if necessary, small, small modules of directional action, which are located according to certain schemes of tacked, for several kilometers. They work around the clock, independently of each other, having every energy supply for 5-7 days. Software is constantly being improved taking into account various factors that fall to the work of the complex. It is the intensity and massness of the work of the gate -artillery, each barrel of which barak should be astonished, the time of day, the temperature environment, etc. The latest updates that have made for barak Odessa are an opportunity to shine the spans of Iranian "Shahmed", as well as a module or system -module when the sounds of outputs are fuzzy. Bazazvis for determining goals is constantly updated, up to calibers less than 82 millimeters. By the way, the latest version of the complex barak is already actively used directly on the Odessa coast.
Modules can be controlled remotely? 
So. If the operator receives from the air intelligence data about the work of the artillery -protector that leads fire on us, and barak it "does not see" at all, Vinidststentally makes a restart of a module, seeks and changes frequency -determination, etc. The operator also has the opportunity to process the obtained data with software algorithms, which, according to the expert, will determine the most precise coordinates of the goals. The data obtained shall be transmitted to the senior boss, who already enforce the expediency or possibility of using the fire in response.
 
As far as I know, there are no world analogues of the world at all. At least by dimensions, survivability, mobility, ease of application and service, width of the observation strip and accuracy during the coverage of a total number of goals. And most importantly - it has a passive effect, it is planned to detect any technical means. He is not capable of influencing the enemy radio struggle. Moreover, it is planted to destroy it physically, such as acoustic intelligence station for a false or armored database. Try to find in the fields and forestry in a few kilometers eight dug and masked under the locality or soils of the case with a suitcase-diploma!Even if the number of them will be accidentally destroyed or failed, the complex will act. The module does not give any radiation, even thermal, and how operators receive information from them - the "secret of the firm".
How long does the algorithm take: "Severe" Coordinates goals - data transfer - a decision - a fire in response? 
Five seconds to determine coordinates, 30 seconds for processing and transferring data to an artillery group, a few minutes to make a decision to impress the target and set the fire task of the artillery unit, and the first shot.
The results are satisfactory? 
More than. In addition to the direct hits, which are constantly in place, we are even naximal shooting distances for errors in determining the coordinates of 50 meters, we can, say, calculations of enemy guns and the guns of the gun-fugitive projectile, fragments of which are flew in a radius of 200 meters. But we or the means of impression of the higher command have a mobile opportunity to suppress the work of the enemy's art to support the action of our possessive.
** Vitaliy Ivanovich, in your opinion, is it capable of barak to take place in the artillery units of our troo
 
 - As far as I understand, barak is simply a short name of the complex, he does not have an industrial manufacturer. But how does the inventor qualify him? 
The definition of the author sounds as follows: "The centralized multi -moderate system of the reconnaissance of the passive principle." And barak is really an abbreviation.
We can see the work of operators barak ? 
So. A officer from the Fire Support Department of the brigade, who is engaged in this direction, will now be coming behind you. You will see the command of operators, which alternates on the complex and shifting, serves modules, exhibits them according to the schemes and replaces the power supply ...
… We talk to the head of the department, the senior operator of complex -reconnaissance Yaroslav.
 - Yaroslav, how much do you think is effective barak ? 
In terms of accuracy of determining the coordinates of shooting guns or reactive systems of volley fire, it is extremely accurate at distances somewhere in 25 kilometers, and gives a small error at the maximum distance of determining the targets of 30 kilometers. Moreover, we already clearly shine the work not only of mortar calibers, but also anti -aircraft installations and even large caliber machine guns 10-12 thousand meters.
Does the quality of work depend on weather conditions or other factors? 
We have six methods of information processing. Four of them take into account the meteodans, which we enter into the program. Each module gives out the results of the "seam" coordinates autonomously. They are combined in a special plate, after which we receive data on the direction of conducting fire - that is, where the orcs are firing, the distance to their firearms, and in the end - their current coordinates. Then we compare the result with the data of the subdivision, with which we are on online communication, and at night additional with information of the respective points at the leading positions. Then we give out the most exact result where it is necessary.
How protected in all senses the modules themselves? - modules give failures? 
Sometimes. But they are able to restart either independently or remotely with the help of operators. By the way, remote control is a single plus barak . There were several cases where the enemy's work was recorded at any of the directions of the speech, and our complex did not hear it. We remotely reconciled the work of several modules into a different frequency range quickly fell out the enemy. Further, our arta was taken for the cause.
You know about the results of her work? 
I know, but I will not voice. When the older command expresses gratitude to us, it means that we and our artillery worked perfectly.
Your impression of barak ? 
He is incredible!
P . S . ** Sond the interview, the author contacted Odessa, namely, and invented _barak (He has now asked for his name). За його словами, цей комплекс вже ефективно працює не тільки наДонецькому напрямку, але й уздовж узбережжя Чорного моря, в акваторії Очакова,у багатьох бойових бригадах на півдні України. Завдяки БАРАК вони посилиликонтрбатарейну боротьбу з орками та вже навчилися виявляти й знищуватиіранські «Шахеди». Команда однодумців у винахідника велика, наразі вона працюєна волонтерських засадах. Про стовідсоткову готовність комплексу до серійноговиробництва, зі слів винахідника, можна буде говорити лише післядержвипробувань та прийняття його на озброєння в ЗСУ._

Enemy hackers attack the critical infrastructure of Ukraine: it is necessary to work constantly.
About it reports Special Communications and Information Protection Telegrams of Ukraine.
From 2022 to this day, the government response team of Ukraine Cert-UA, which operates at the State Secretariat, has worked and explored more than 3,000 cyberincyders and cyberattacks.
Among the goals of hostile hackers are many objects of critical infrastructure of Ukraine, because the attackers do not leave attempts to leave Ukrainians without vital services.
The State Secretariat is reminiscent of: even those organizations in which the protection is built by the curtailed standards must constantly overestimate the risks, test the various scenarios of penetration and the possibility of detecting attacks, updating knowledge and documenting processes, since hostile hackers use the whole arsenal.
 Today, we all have to understand that even after the end of the Convention against IT infrastructure, we can last for many years.
Russian hackers continue to penetrate the network of critical infrastructure as through computers of executives(What are the use of unlicensed programs), and through computers of IT administrators who consider it protected, and through trust with suppliers, including IT software-developed software.
Therefore, strengthening of their own protection is extremely important for everyone: the university of the organization - to the trainee, from the water supplier - to the Department of Social Administration.
