This was said in [video address](https://t.me/OP_UA/9782)Presidential lodimer Zelensky, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Video: [Presidential Office](https://t.me/OP_UA/9782)** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

** _ I wish health, all the people of the world!_ **

Today is the day when there should definitely not be silence. And leadership is definitely needed.

Today, the world saw that the owners of Russia were not controlling anything. In general. Just full chaos. The complete absence of any predictability. And it is a napan territory that is stuffed with weapons.

We all remember how in the 21st year the head of Russia threatened the world. He had some ultimatums there, he tried to show some force there.

The 22nd year showed that he confused-he confused his illusions of the Tabr, which he was fed. They are there, in the Kremlin, capable of going to any terror capable of go to any stupidity, but they cannot provide percentage control. And they are a real problem.

In one day, they lost several millionaire cities and showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs and anyone else, as it is easy to capture Russian cities and probably arsenals with weapons.

It is very important now that no one in the world is silent because it is afraid of this Russian chaos. All leaders' actions can now be historical. Every word journalists - by weight of gold. The source of the problem should be clearly called. And if someone in the world tries to sleep the situation, if someone in the world is exposed to illusia, as if the Kremlin is able to restore control, then only delaying the problem of a torture breakthrough of chaos - even more dangerous.

We all know the solution.

First, the world should not be afraid. We know that only our unity protects us.

Ukraine will definitely protect Europe from any Russian forces, it is important who commands them. We will protect. The safety of the eastern flank of Europe will only be in our defense. And that is why every manifestation of our defense is also supporting your defense, all in the free world.Second: everything should be real. It is time for everyone in the world to say that Russia's comprehensive actions against Ukraine have been and are unprovured. And we all have to orient our joint security priorities.

NATO is not just a word or set of formal promises. It is a reliable guarantee of all that peace will not be destroyed. Without Ukraine, such guarantees are nothing. Already in July at a summit in Vilnius - a historical chance for real decisions of loving on Russia. Any nation that borders with Russia is really supporting.

And the third.

I will say in Russian. The Kremlin's person, obviously, is sought to be very scared, and the spinning, it is not shown. Imved, which is no longer in Moscow. Welcome to something, it will work something. He knows, he was afraid, so that he himself is a creation of etougrosis. All evil, all the craft, all the hatred - he is a space. And more thanks, he is a hunger over his bunkers, the topics of all, everything, everything, that is squeezed with Russia.

What will we do, Ukrainian?

And we will blame their country. We will be delayed by their freedom. We will not build, and we will not be unattended. We will run out - and this will be. Our war in this war will be unambiguously.

And what do you do?

Moreover, the army will be on the Ukrainian land, the topics of the top were shaped by the tidy of the night to Russia. What will it be a man in the Kremlin, the topics of the catastrophe.

Now I'll move on to my native.

Thank you to our soldiers!Thank you all who are beating the occupiers now!Thank you to the air for the protection of our sky!

**_ Glory to Ukraine!_ **

** _ Let's win!_ **

![](Images/yкринформ/2023-06-24T12-41-00-03-00/630_360_1584996574-182.jpg)The Ministry of Health continues to inform how to prepare possible emergencies at the Zaporozhye NPP, which is temporarily captured by Russia.

According to Ukrinform, the MoH was published in [telegram](https://t.me/mozofficial/3541?fbclid=IwAR1wOfRTwuhYGrRPg5nTdSrQ1MXX5TE5eFl_9IQmJC_rN-QcVVv76BDhx5E)Tips for the content of home first aid kits of the inhabitants of the 50-kilometer-long zone around the ZPP.

The message stresses that this information applies only to residents of the 50-kilometer zone around [ZPES](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zaporizka-aes)And it is not relevant for people living outside this radius.

The Ministry of Health is advised to make sure that there is potassium iodide in the first aid kit, which is useful to reduce the negative impact of radioactive iodine into the thyroid in the event of a nuclear object.

It is necessary to take the required dose of iodide potassium only after official alert!

** Read also: ** [Vereshchuk on Risks on ** ZPP **: It is not necessary to be afraid of Russians, but their cephalopods](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3727008-veresuk-pro-riziki-na-zaes-boatis-treba-ne-rosian-a-ihnogo-golovotapstva.html)It is optimal to take the drug after alerting for 6 or less hours of overcoming the radioactive cloud, but potassium iodide remains effective with the receipt of the "cloud" and 6 hours after it.

The drug is not recommended 24 hours after the cloud is received.

Aluminum-antacid sorbents should also be in the first aid kit. Such a group of means will contain the active substance hydroxide of aluminum and are used to accelerate the notorization, binding and excretion of radionuclides from the body and, thus, a decrease in the risk of health due to their receipt.

In addition, it is necessary to take care of the presence of alginate, the active substance - sodiumalginate. It creates a protective barrier on the surface of the liquid stomach content. This barrier prevents the body from being absorbed.

Also in the first aid kit should be put sodium bicarbonate, a remedy for the restoration of alkaline blood and correction of metabolic acidosis(a condition characterized by a breaking of chemical balance of acids and alkali in the blood).

In the first aid kit must be a mask, which is a means of physical protection of the hazard to reduce the ingress of dangerous substances.

As reported by Ukrinform, the risk that the Russians will commit another terrorist attack by the Nazaposhi NPP remains high. [In the case of radiation hazard](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3726454-moz-dalo-poradi-ukraincam-so-robiti-v-razi-radiacijnoi-avarii.html)It is necessary to get a job as soon as possible and follow the instructions of the SES and local authorities.

According to Ukrinform, the Minister of Culture and Information Policy Oleksandrkachenko announced this on the national telephone "Yeninovina", commenting on the adoption of the law on the ban on imports of books from Tabilorus.

“Import of Russian books is forbidden. It is worth noting that it is needed work, including law enforcement agencies, because the so -called gray or black import exists. In addition, in Ukraine, unfortunately, some of the books published in Russia are favorably illegally. I think that during the war it is a rather right decision, because the termination of this flow of Russian literature into Ukraine will allow to focus on Ukrainian publishers on their own work, ”the minister said.

"The Conference in London has exceeded my hopes, but they may not have been high after this year's experience in Lugano, where everything was very swallowed at the level of general principles. One of the great differences is the CTA active the presence of [business](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-biznes), in particular, foreign ones. The Ukrainian business was also, but could be even better representative, ”Vashchuk says.

Although, according to him, "last year state representatives were in conferences, and business - separately" behind the fence "himself held his meetings. Therefore, a very important and positive moment."

About it on air [Ukrainian radio](https://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101718)Romanvashchuk told the business ombudsman.

He noted that, according to the World Bank, there are 5 directions in Ukraine that are re -rebellious. Next year, more than 14 billion dollars are required. The fifth point is the economic support of small and medium -sized businesses.

"Can be rebuilt for people [housing](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zitlo), you can additionally visit a school with shelter, but if there is no bakery, a pharmacy of a grocery store in a town or in a village, then people will not return there. So, the reconstruction of small and medium -sized businesses is commemorative for the life of communities. Many at the conference spoke about decentralization, not only to focus on the temporary military centralization of funds, but to return to the money to go to the places where they can be best distributed. And it seems to me that it will be one of the accents in the approach to this question, " - summarizes Vashchuk.

At the same time, in the belief of a business ombudsman, before launching programs of support that costs money, and they are not currently lacking, it is necessary to stop doing something that damages the business. "For example, how taxes and customs in Ukraine should continue to change in favor of business. That is: fewer stops, less non -neus inspections, less determination of arbitrary customs value, so as to simply perceive an account from the EU country and the declaration of its customs service for a clean coin. It is necessary for business to be able to spend time and energy to help, to help, to develop, not to reflect from all kinds of official encroachments. The first steps are already scheduled, in particular in the tax sphere. Ina conferences in the presentations of the Ministry of Economy and Economic Deputy Fire of the President. Changes in these areas. We need to see that we will see in these areas over the next months, "he said.

За її словами, імперський похід за новими землями не може перекрити внутрішніпроблеми в державі, а лише загострити, що і відбувається.

“Яку б державу вони не будували, в них всеодно виходить "Гулаг", який рано чипізно бунтує і ії розвалює”, - наголосила Маляр.

About it in an interview [Welt](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus246031950/Deutscher-Brigadegeneral-Die-Russen-haben-dazugelernt.html?icid=search.product.onsitesearch)The head of the special staff on Ukraine at the Ministry of Defense of Germany Bradygadniegner Christian Freuding reported, Ukrinform reports.

The general called air defense a key weakness in the current contrast of the Armed Forces.

“We do our best to support the best. We put into Ukraine two SLM Iris-T, two more-this year, four more-in 2024. We put34 Gepard anti -aircraft tanks, 15 more - the next weeks. In addition, by the end of the year we want to put up to 30 Gepard SAU in cooperation with the United States. We also gave the Patriot Complex as one of the three nations. We do what we can. But this is the case, whether Ukraine has enough air defense? It is clear that no!”Freuding said.

He called the "treachery of the Russian strategy" that they continue to attach settlements to force Ukrainians to concentrate a anti -air defense around cities. But the offensive would need air defense, Aii is currently not in the right amount. Ukraine cannot leave this dilemma, the general admitted. At each meeting of partners in the so -called Ramstaynu -Ukrainians format three priorities: [air defense](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-ppo), Air defense, aircraft, he reminded.

According to him, Ukraine as a party that requires success requires a local advantage of 3: 1 or even 5: 1. The army of the Russian army, which turned out to be, do not underestimate their possibility: Russian armed forces still need to be taken seriously, they have a great potential for personnel, armored vehicles. And they still have air and naval forces, as well as in the last 15 months, the Russians have "studied, albeit to a limited extent", - said the commander.** Read also: ** [About the deployment of the SAMP/T complex in Ukraine the Air Force Commander - Ignatius](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3726120-pro-rozgortanna-v-ukraini-kompleksu-sampt-ogolosit-komanduvac-povitranih-sil-ignat.html)Freuding praised the efficiency as a German weapon transferred to the Armed Forces, so they are using it. The IRIS-T SLM air defense system has, according to it, almost100 percent accuracy. Very effective Patriot, so last week FRNNIVRIRIVRIR immediately transfer 64 missiles to this system from the Bundeswehr warehouses.

“And the Gepard, which we removed from our weapons, is experiencing the Renaissance that we could not imagine. It is especially effective in protecting from drones of icer missiles. We will also be able to supply new production ammunition for Gepard. With regard to artillery, the Ukrainian army is convinced that Panzerhaubitze 2000 is the most effective and fastest gun that is at their discharge. And if we talk about tanks, "Leopard -2" and "Leopard -1 A5" clearly outperform Russian samples in hostilities by combat capabilities. They have the ability to night fighting, the advantage of range and the ability to lead while driving, " -said general.

He also recalled that a few weeks ago, the Bundestag allocated more than 12 billion -year -olds for military support of Ukraine, which included projects by 2032. It will guarantee that we are constantly supporting Ukraine.

As it was reported, a special national in Ukraine was established at the end of February 2022.

This was said in [video address](https://t.me/OP_UA/9782)Presidential lodimer Zelensky, Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Video: [Presidential Office](https://t.me/OP_UA/9782)** _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ **

** _ I wish health, all the people of the world!_ **

Today is the day when there should definitely not be silence. And leadership is definitely needed.

Today, the world saw that the owners of Russia were not controlling anything. In general. Just full chaos. The complete absence of any predictability. And it is a napan territory that is stuffed with weapons.

We all remember how in the 21st year the head of Russia threatened the world. He had some ultimatums there, he tried to show some force there.

The 22nd year showed that he confused-he confused his illusions of the Tabr, which he was fed. They are there, in the Kremlin, capable of going to any terror capable of go to any stupidity, but they cannot provide percentage control. And they are a real problem.

In one day, they lost several millionaire cities and showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs and anyone else, as it is easy to capture Russian cities and probably arsenals with weapons.

It is very important now that no one in the world is silent because it is afraid of this Russian chaos. All leaders' actions can now be historical. Every word journalists - by weight of gold. The source of the problem should be clearly called. And if someone in the world tries to sleep the situation, if someone in the world is exposed to illusia, as if the Kremlin is able to restore control, then only delaying the problem of a torture breakthrough of chaos - even more dangerous.

We all know the solution.

First, the world should not be afraid. We know that only our unity protects us.

Ukraine will definitely protect Europe from any Russian forces, it is important who commands them. We will protect. The safety of the eastern flank of Europe will only be in our defense. And that is why every manifestation of our defense is also supporting your defense, all in the free world.Second: everything should be real. It is time for everyone in the world to say that Russia's comprehensive actions against Ukraine have been and are unprovured. And we all have to orient our joint security priorities.

NATO is not just a word or set of formal promises. It is a reliable guarantee of all that peace will not be destroyed. Without Ukraine, such guarantees are nothing. Already in July at a summit in Vilnius - a historical chance for real decisions of loving on Russia. Any nation that borders with Russia is really supporting.

And the third.

I will say in Russian. The Kremlin's person, obviously, is sought to be very scared, and the spinning, it is not shown. Imved, which is no longer in Moscow. Welcome to something, it will work something. He knows, he was afraid, so that he himself is a creation of etougrosis. All evil, all the craft, all the hatred - he is a space. And more thanks, he is a hunger over his bunkers, the topics of all, everything, everything, that is squeezed with Russia.

What will we do, Ukrainian?

And we will blame their country. We will be delayed by their freedom. We will not build, and we will not be unattended. We will run out - and this will be. Our war in this war will be unambiguously.

And what do you do?

Moreover, the army will be on the Ukrainian land, the topics of the top were shaped by the tidy of the night to Russia. What will it be a man in the Kremlin, the topics of the catastrophe.

Now I'll move on to my native.

Thank you to our soldiers!Thank you all who are beating the occupiers now!Thank you to the air for the protection of our sky!

**_ Glory to Ukraine!_ **

** _ Let's win!_ **

“Our strategic goal and purpose is to liberate all our territories. The Russians will try to try to complete the tasks to say whether their "special military operation" is completed, or they have finished, " - said the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

According to him, in the near future Russians will not be able to enter the administrative border and Luhansk region, which remains one of the goals of the enemy.

Vadim Skibitsky described the difficulties of the aggressor state: Russia is trying to fill the personnel liquidated in the war in Ukraine, but the scale mobilization was not the same as in the fall of 2022.

At the same time, he added that terrorist Moscow has more serious problems:

“All new parts of the enemy try to equip very quickly. This does not work. The question is not only in people - the question arises in modern weapons, but a darkness, which is stored in the warehouses of the Russian Federation after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has a lot of investments to bring to normal combat, ” - explained representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Personally we do not agree. They tried to take away the person of extremely serious injuries, which is between life and death. It will be able to fight, that is, it will not cause any harm to the aggressor country, but it has not been not available. Personnel negotiations can only hurt returns. Such a impression, they deliberately do not give difficult to make us pain. "

Discussed cases where the names of the defenders appear on the Internet several days before the exchange:

“The Russians sometimes make such" showers "two days before the exchange. Sometimes it is unreasonable. And sometimes - not completely. Someone is not returned, and relatives are already awaiting people at home. Then they despair. That is why we do not publish the Jodni -cuttings before the exchange. "

The headquarters also stressed that with the least possibility we take away, despite the unit - paratroopers, Marines, border guards:

"If there is one chance out of a thousand, we cling to him. They have not yet refused a blade of person. "

About this [deputy](https://t.me/annamaliar/882)The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Hannamars wrote in her telegram.

Anna Malyar emphasized that Ukrainians can regard events that have begun asleep as the inevitable degradation of the Russian state.

For Ukraine, this is a window of opportunity, but it is not necessary to relax, it is better to be careful and prepared for any scenario.

"We are working on our strengthening and victory," she said.

The Deputy Minister of Defense noted that the imperial campaign on new lands could not cover the internal problems in the state - only aggravating. What is Ivid. Whatever the state they build, they still get a "gulag", which sooner or later rebels and breaks down.

“The war in Ukraine has shown the weakest place of the Russian Empire - fear of preference. All their solutions are based on lies. They always created "air locks" for the king and believed in them themselves. This is such an imperial feature - to indulge in your own grandeur and overestimate yourself. This was prompted by a completely adequate decision - to solve the war with Ukraine without systematic truthful calculations of their own capabilities. Exclusively ambition and arrogance. The price of this non -governmental solution is the fate of Russia itself. They are fighting with us and destroying themselves, ”her post reads.

Anna Malyar emphasized that if you look globally at this as an evolutionary process, then a non -viable system launched a self -destruction program. There is no conspiracy or world conspiracy. These are natural processes.

“They will destroy themselves as a state in this form, and we will naturally defeat themselves, are painfully ready to move forward. We are a nation that now creates a new type of culture in the world. To us - culture always lost barbarism. We prove that you can be strong, protect yourself and remain civilized. Therefore, the future is behind us, and Russia is the past, ” - summarized.

What is happening in the Russian Federation today, and three weeks earlier in the Belgorod region, is a natural and logical consequence of the aggressive imperial politics of those who are currently in the helm of the Russian state. The dictators' dictators are not good for rising internal problems.

About this [it is referred](https://t.me/militarymediacenter/2344)In a comment to MilitaryMedia Center.

“Any empires built on lies, coercion and ideological perversions are doomed to death. As soon as the empire ceases to expand, entropic processes are switched on - and today's armed rebellion in Russia is just a place. We can only sincerely wish both the sides, ”the testimony reads.

The Militation Media Center showed a "current account" on the scoreboard that "PVC is currently leading, but by the end of the match is still very far":

Just full chaos. The complete absence of any predictability. And it is a napan territory that is stuffed with weapons.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/ukrayina-tochno-zmozhe-zahistiti-yevropu-vid-bud-yakih-rosij-83781)In your evening address.

“We all remember how in the 21st year the head of Russia threatened the world. He had some ultimatums there, he tried to show some force there.

The 22nd year showed that he confused-he confused his illusions of the Tabr, which he was fed. They are there, in the Kremlin, capable of going to any terror capable of go to any stupidity, but they cannot provide percentage control. And they are a real problem, ”he said.

In one day, they lost several millionaire cities and showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs and anyone else, as it is easy to capture Russian cities and probably arsenals with weapons.

The head of state stressed that it is very important now that no one in the world is silent what is afraid of this Russian chaos. All leaders' actions can now be historical. Every word of journalists - by weight of gold. The source of the problem should be clear. And if someone in the world tries to sleep the situation, if someone in the world is illusion, as if the Kremlin is able to restore control, then only delaying the problem before the next breakthrough of chaos - even more dangerous. We all know the solution.

“The first: the world should not be afraid. We know that we only protect us.

Ukraine will definitely protect Europe from any Russian forces, it is important who commands them. We will protect. The safety of the eastern flank of Europe will only be in our defense. And that is why every manifestation of our defense is also supporting your defense, all in the free world.

Ukrainian warriors, Ukrainian guns, Ukrainian tanks, Ukrainian missiles are what protects Europe from such marchs, as we see Natrospian territory today. And when we turn to F-16 or ATACMS, we will develop common protection. Real protection. This is what you need. Now is the time of giving the necessary to protect weapons.NATO is not just a word or set of formal promises. It is a reliable guarantee of all that peace will not be destroyed. Without Ukraine, such guarantees are nothing. Already in July at a summit in Vilnius - a historical chance for real decisions of loving on Russia. Any nation that borders with Russia is really supporting, ”the head of state emphasized.

The President of Ukraine also addressed Russian:

“I will say in Russian. The Kremlin's person, obviously, is sought to be very scared, and the spinning, it is not shown. Imved, which is no longer in Moscow. Welcome to something, it will work something. He knows, he was afraid, so that he himself is a creation of etougrosis. All evil, all the craft, all the hatred - he is a space. And more thanks, he is a hunger over his bunkers, the topics of all, everything, everything, that is squeezed with Russia.

What will we do, Ukrainian?

And we will blame their country. We will be delayed by their freedom. We will not build, and we will not be unattended. We will run out - and this will be. Our war in this war will be unambiguously.

And what do you do?

Moreover, the army will be on the Ukrainian land, the topics of the top were shaped by the tidy of the night to Russia. If it will be a man in the Kremlin, the topics of the catastrophe, ”the address reads.

Volodymyr Zelensky thanked our soldiers and air forces for a more protected sky.
