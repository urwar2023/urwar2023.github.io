 Volodymyr Zelenskyy
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the daily message of the D -Ukrainian people:
The other two sanctions lists are natural and legal persons that help sanctions against Russia, hold the property of military criminals and involve the reduction of freedom both in the territory of Russia itself and in our land.
Our sanction packages are elaborated in detail, and in particular - for synchronization from partners. This is one of our common tasks - absolutely everyone who will end the faster end of the war, faster than our victory. The task is to remove any opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. Each Russian scheme that allows you to bypass sanctions, adds time to this war, adds opportunities to the aggressor.
Accordingly, the sanction regime against Russia, which is more restricted in front of the terrorist state and all related persons, against the whole Russian economic economy of war, will be more likely to complete aggression. And I thank everyone in the world who understands it.
Glory to all our soldiers!Glory to all our heroes of different times who fought for the independence!Ukraine will always be free!Glory to Ukraine!

We have never attacked anyone and did not have no territorial claims. We just want Russia to return what it stole from us. And I mean not only the Ukrainian territory. Also Russian stole peace in Europe and stability in the world, ”the General Foreign Ministry wrote.Kuleba expressed his deep gratitude to all allies and partners, including Znimenchyna, for tireless support since February 2022.

 The Kremlin came up with a method of replenishing the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and reducing the level of voltage, reports Center of National Establishment.
In Russia, migrants from Central Asia began to be pressed and demanded in the war against Ukraine. The Russians go two ways.
The first is through military enlistment offices, and this applies to migrants who are the owners of the Russian passport. Almost immediately, they receive a summons and during the communication with the excommonation, they will receive threats that they will be deprived of citizenship if they will be mobilized.
The second applies to those who have not yet received the passport. They are promised to receive a citizen in the shortest possible time, if they go to the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. In the case of their reflection, they are threatened with deportation.
One of the reasons for this decision is the dissatisfaction with the families of Russian servicemen on delays in payments for the dead. The mobilization of migrant has been concerned with the reassurance of ethnic Russians about new waves of mobilization. In such a way, the Kremlin continues the strategy of use as cannon meat inhabitants and less secured people as opposed to Muscovites.

According to him, the Armed Forces Command has been informed by the Armed Forces for almost a month, however, that we have new threats from enemy aviation. The enemy fighter-bombers Su-35, Su-34 are attacked by managed aircraft.
- This ammunition is not a new invention. This is that they use a miserable amount of rocket weapons. Therefore, they began to modernize the bombs. To make them with JDAM analogues, that is, planning high -precision ammunition. Examine them without entering the area of lesions of our air defense. That is, unpacked areas that they can affect up to 70 kilometers. Unfortunately it is a serious call. The bomb has 500 kilograms. Similar ammunition was dropped on their own Belgorod. And everyone saw what it had a consequence. The enemy does it to beat our frontline cities, in a residential area. It is difficult for him. But we will intensify by getting new systems to counteract these new threats, - Yuri Ignat.
He also noted that the Russian Federation uses up to 40 airports to attack Ukraine. This is the airfields in the occupied Crimea, and the airfields in the aggressor country in the near, far and medium approaches to our borders. And about 20 aircraft from cyaerodromes are in the air in the light of the day.
Colonel Yuri Ignat also showed a selfie with Patriot air defense system and said that one of the divisions, armed with this air defense system, has already receded for combat -fighting for the protection of Ukraine's airspace. According to him, the Commander of the Armed Forces personally visited the combat position of the division to thank the personnel warehouse, which was prepared early in Germany and returned faster to intercede for the protection of the air borders of Ukraine.
- Other samples of air defense systems that we promised to pass Western partners, are already a path to our combat positions. We will wait for positive results. In particular, against Rushist aircraft, - Yuri Ignat.

 Collage from the official page of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in FB
19 393 children!On the official page of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Facebook, the first -time chairman(https://www.facebook.com/verkhovna.rada.ukraine/posts/pfbid03SEpYnt3XEuRY7JNzJdfsLQBJXVakDvAw5oCUEfZ3sEew7E2uAyyLNqvGr4pmKaVl)Information of the online platform "Children of War" about the number of deported to the Russian Russian children.
-However, in fact, the invaders could take out about 200-300 thousand people. According to the data voiced in open sources, deported children are much more - over 700,000, - writes Irina Konstankevich.
The study of the Yale Laboratory of Humanitarian Studies refers to a majority of 70 camps for "re -education" of these children. It is a systematic state policy of the Russian Federation in order to re -educate Ukrainian children, destroying their identity.
They cynically kill all their native and expensive for our children, take away their benefits, deprive them of the past, violate their rights. They abduct our future. They do their best to make Ukrainian children find and return to their homeland.
