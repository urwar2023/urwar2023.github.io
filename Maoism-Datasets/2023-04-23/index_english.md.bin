President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the daily message of the D -Ukrainian people:

- Today, three new sanction decisions have come into force on those who are hidden in Russian aggression and supports it, - [noted](https://www.president.gov.ua/videos/zavdannya-pribrati-bud-yaki-mozhlivosti-rosiyi-obhoditi-sank-4573)President. -First of all, it is a regular package of sanctions against the Russian MIC-enterprises that provide a terrorist army. This time, 322 companies were added to the sanctions lists: manufacturers of weapons, components and the like.

The other two sanctions lists are natural and legal persons that help sanctions against Russia, hold the property of military criminals and involve the reduction of freedom both in the territory of Russia itself and in our land.

Our sanction packages are elaborated in detail, and in particular - for synchronization from partners. This is one of our common tasks - absolutely everyone who will end the faster end of the war, faster than our victory. The task is to remove any opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. Each Russian scheme that allows you to bypass sanctions, adds time to this war, adds opportunities to the aggressor.

Accordingly, the sanction regime against Russia, which is more restricted in front of the terrorist state and all related persons, against the whole Russian economic economy of war, will be more likely to complete aggression. And I thank everyone in the world who understands it.

Glory to all our soldiers!Glory to all our heroes of different times who fought for the independence!Ukraine will always be free!Glory to Ukraine!

As Ukrinform reports, it reports [](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/23/un-security-council-russia-us-00093272)With reference to the State Department official.

“This means referral to some lower-rank diplomats instead of Linda Thomas Grinfield. These diplomats then left the meetings on the time, ”the official explained on the conditions of anonymity.

Thomas-Grinfield also missed a traditional breakfast that the Russians made the opportunity to start their presidency on April 3.

According to the official, all this testifies to the need for Washington's stated - changes in the structure of the United Nations.

"It is madness that Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council after Vonomaggrubo has violated the UN Charter," he said. "It is really one of the many manifestations that the Security Council and the UN as a whole need reform."

The UN is accustomed to the weirdos, absurdity and a certain part of hypocrisy, notes the publication, but in April, "it reached epic scale, as Russia has taken over the Chairman of the UN Security Council on a rotary basis and used it to make its war against Ukraine."

On April 5, the Russian Federation met the members of the RB in the format of Arriya to justify children from the occupied territories of Ukraine.

On April 10, it organized open debate in the Radbeza to accuse Western countries of supplying weapons to Ukraine.

On Monday, April 24, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be prescribed at a meeting of the RB on the protection of the principles of the UN Charter, including the prevention of wars.

"They try to troll us," said the American official. - They see topics that relate to their most flashy actions in this war, they are able to turn everything upside down. We will not fall on it. "

As it was reported, in April, Russia is presiding on the UN Security Council. The presidency of this body changes every month between its members. In May, this role will be done by Switzerland, in June - the UAE.

The Council consists of five permanent members ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon)** - USA, UK, France, Chinese Russia(on the site of the Soviet Union), vetoed, as well as 10 member states on a rotary basis.

The wife of the deceased Natalia recalls that Dmitry did not think for a moment or to war.

“He was very brave and steadfast. Honest and fair. At first, I thought, why didn't I get it off? But then he said to him, "Who could stop your father? No one…". He believed in Ukraine, believed UNASH victory and wanted to bring it closer, ”says Natalia.

About it in the comment [](https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,1564457,wiceszef-msz-gdyby-niemcy-nie-staraly-sie-opoznic-wejscia-ukrainy-do-nato)The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Piotr Vuzhik, commenting on the German Defense Minister Boris Panstorius that it is not very appropriate to speak about Ukraine's membership in NATO and this decision should be made with a “cold head”, Ukrinform reports.

"Question: When will it be time for these" cold heads ": 10 or 30 years after the war?",- said Vjuzhik, responding to the words of Pistorius.

According to Vuzhik, the position of the German minister can delay Ukraine's accession to NATO, since when the new country is accepted to the Alliance, one is required by the individual among the Member States of the Organization.

He stressed that Poland supports Ukraine's membership in the EU.

"In our opinion, the faster it will happen, the better, because it will be a guarantee not only of Ukraine and Poland, but of the whole region," - said the deputy Glava of Polish diplomacy.

Vjuzhik assured that Warsaw is trying to convince Western partners all the time to change their minds and that Ukraine would join Donato as soon as possible.

This is stated in the guest article by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmitrykuleb for the German edition [](https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article244947038/Dmytro-Kuleba-Russland-hat-auch-Europa-den-Frieden-gestohlen.html), reports Ukrinform.

"The territorial integrity of Ukraine needs to be restored, a compromise with Moscowava would be fatal consequences for the future world order," - a confident Kuleba.

He draws attention to the fact that, against the background of the weakening of Russia's offensive in eastern Ukraine, the expected Ukrainian offensive voices from all over the world call for peaceful interpretations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, to the immediate ceasefire. These voices are the fact that Russia has not demonstrated the real interest of the pre -core negotiations or termination of hostilities, the minister said. Vinuuly is that the words of Moscow are worth nothing and it will still continue to furnish Ukraine to kill more people and seize more territories.

“No country in the world seeks peace like Ukraine. But we also know that a truly peace must be fair and strong. The vision of Ukraine is realistic and concrete, ”the Foreign Minister emphasized. He reminded the proformula of President Vladimir Zelensky's peace and urged all the nations to support it.

** Read also: ** [](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3699079-u-mzs-zaavili-ukraina-ne-vstupatime-v-nato-castinami.html)Kyiv carefully examines all proposals and welcomes any initiative that respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the principles of the UN Charter and the relevant operations of the General Assembly, the diplomat added. But, he noted, any proposition of Ukraine will be rejected to territorial concessions.

“We never wanted this war and we do not want more than what belongs to the international law and the UN Charter. It is a realistic and legal requirement, which is not a maximalist. We have never attacked anyone and did not have no territorial claims. We just want Russia to return what it stole from us. And I mean not only the Ukrainian territory. Also Russian stole peace in Europe and stability in the world, ”the General Foreign Ministry wrote.Kuleba expressed his deep gratitude to all allies and partners, including Znimenchyna, for tireless support since February 2022. This help saved many lives and helped Ukrainians survive, he emphasized.

If we make a mistake now and decide to reward Putin for his aggression in a different form, not to win him as a lesson for all other potential aggressors, the future of Ukraine, Europe and the world will be in danger, ”Kuleb wrote.

He stressed that true peace means the restoration of international recognized border of Ukraine. True peace means a safe homeland for the Crimean Tatar people in Ukrainian Crimea. True peace means grain, not warships in the Black Sea. A true peace means a world united under the rule of international law.

The UN is accustomed to the weirdos, absurdity and a certain part of hypocrisy, notes the publication, but in April, "it reached epic scale, as Russia has taken over the Chairman of the UN Security Council on a rotary basis and used it to make its war against Ukraine."

On Monday, April 24, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be prescribed at a meeting of the RB on the protection of the principles of the UN Charter, including the prevention of wars.

- Many have already voiced these news. In particular, we have a comment on the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov. And the topic of providing modern combat aircraft for Ukraine is always in priority, - said the spokesman of the Air Force of the Armed Forces.

According to him, air defense means are also a priority task today. Not only the systems themselves, but also rockets to them. A very large stock of rocketbulo was used in the autumn and winter.

- But the Patriot systems have already come, we are waiting for other systems to enhance with retaase. It will not be possible to get planes at one time. It is necessary for this at least. And the air defense systems can be obtained now. Because there are already noon people on Nasams, Iris-T, Patriot, and Samp/T. This is that it can help in the short term. There will be more meetings in Ramstin. And not alone, apparently. We hope that there will be a fateful decision that the Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. We will wait for good news, ”Yuri Ignat said

- Obviously, they can do it not only before the cold. But they did not reach their goal. The Russian Federation will use any ways and methodologics in the missile potential. Last autumn and winter, they launched so many rockets that they would not be able to accumulate even a third of them from them that remained until the fall of 2023. Because the production of rocket flights lasts for a long time. And in the context of sanctions, it is not easy to implement it. The war will try to get additional systems in other countries. The prose was said half a year ago. And we know what countries in this process can be involved, whom they wanted to attach to such cooperation, - said Yurignat.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-23T77-00-00-04-00/img_20230423_110419_209.jpg)Members of the US Congress at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs condemned the deportation of Ukrainian children and submitted a relevant resolution to the Senate's gates. They emphasized that such hearings help to find the levers and ways to hold the perpetrators responsible, [reports](https://minre.gov.ua/2023/04/23/amerykanski-zakonodavczi-zaklykaly-rosiyu-negajno-povernuty-deportovanyh-ukrayinskyh-ditej/)Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine.

The participants of the meeting gave the facts when the invaders literally torn children from the families, were taken to the camps where they live in inhumane conditions. In places of intervening, they are pressed by Russian propaganda. In this way, they try to re -educate and make obedience. It is not only a war crime, it is a sign of the agenocide and an attempt to erase the very identity of the nation.

Congressmen noted that the International Criminal Court of Putin's International Criminal Court on this accusation is the first of many important steps to bring Russia's senior political leadership.

This resolution should demonstrate that the American people support Ukrainian aspirations to fight for their democracy and the return of these children to their homes.

In Russia, migrants from Central Asia began to be pressed and demanded in the war against Ukraine. The Russians go two ways.

The first is through military enlistment offices, and this applies to migrants who are the owners of the Russian passport. Almost immediately, they receive a summons and during the communication with the excommonation, they will receive threats that they will be deprived of citizenship if they will be mobilized.

The second applies to those who have not yet received the passport. They are promised to receive a citizen in the shortest possible time, if they go to the ranks of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. In the case of their reflection, they are threatened with deportation.

One of the reasons for this decision is the dissatisfaction with the families of Russian servicemen on delays in payments for the dead. The mobilization of migrant has been concerned with the reassurance of ethnic Russians about new waves of mobilization. In such a way, the Kremlin continues the strategy of use as cannon meat inhabitants and less secured people as opposed to Muscovites.

This is what we fight for - not only for victory in the war, but also for a real, long -term peace, ”the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine explained.

Always help our soldiers when needed, always support the state defense as possible.

19 393 children!On the official page of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Facebook, the first -time chairman(https://www.facebook.com/verkhovna.rada.ukraine/posts/pfbid03SEpYnt3XEuRY7JNzJdfsLQBJXVakDvAw5oCUEfZ3sEew7E2uAyyLNqvGr4pmKaVl)Information of the online platform "Children of War" about the number of deported to the Russian Russian children.

-However, in fact, the invaders could take out about 200-300 thousand people. According to the data voiced in open sources, deported children are much more - over 700,000, - writes Irina Konstankevich.

The study of the Yale Laboratory of Humanitarian Studies refers to a majority of 70 camps for "re -education" of these children. It is a systematic state policy of the Russian Federation in order to re -educate Ukrainian children, destroying their identity.

They cynically kill all their native and expensive for our children, take away their benefits, deprive them of the past, violate their rights. They abduct our future. They do their best to make Ukrainian children find and return to their homeland.

通常，在地面上，在与地球磁极20-35°的距离上观察到这种光泽，同时又有不同的强度。 它在50°纬度上发现，因此对于该地区，这种现象极为罕见。

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-04-24T99-00-00-04-00/minre.jpeg)The missing families often do not know how to act and to which bodies to call on issues that concern them.

Minreintegration [cite](https://minre.gov.ua/2023/04/23/algorytmy-dij-dlya-rodyn-znyklyh-bezvisty/)The most common questions:

* Interaction of families disappeared with territorial centers of equipment and social support. * How to get information about the investigator who conducts criminal proceedings. * Registration of money of the missing person. * How to get an excerpt from the Unified Register of Pre -trial Investigations.

The Ministry of Reintegration has prepared algorithms for the most pressing issues. Algorithms were developed on the basis of requests received on the hot lines of the missing person. Answers to the most pressing questions are stamped on [link](https://minre.gov.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/algorytm_dij_dlya_rodyn_znyklyh_bezvisty_04.pdf).
