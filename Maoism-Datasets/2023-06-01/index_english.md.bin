Information from cameras can be obtained from online broadcasting through a streaming-naval platform or through a hacker "fracture".

The SBU also emphasizes that it is forbidden to shoot and publish photographs on the activity of defense forces and the consequences of hostile shelling. The extension of such records is a crime that provides punishment for up to 12 years.

Today, when all of Ukraine successfully opposes the undercover and treacherous enemy, it is extremely important not to give the invaders even the slightest opportunity to adjust the shelling.

So, we ask to be vigilant and follow security recommendations!

He expressed this opinion in an interview "[Channel 24](https://24tv.ua/gromadyanska-viyna-rozval-shho-chekaye-rosiyu-mihaylo-podolyak_n2326010?fbclid=IwAR1iMplwVpW-j6TTOyj0ksiNmUsHC0T_dUH1otQdfC5La7BFlsKYQmomeKE)”, Reports Ukrinform.

Commenting on the shelling of Russia on the Day of Children's Defense, Podolyak noted that [RF](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)shows his true face.

“They are like that. They were like that. They were masked for a long time, they always used to be propaganda to disguise their hateful sincere attitude around. And above all, to us. But they use this time that has fallen to them, the last summer to kill as many common people they hate as possible. That is, they are no longer masking anything, they are frank in their propaganda narratives, you see on the playgrounds, they will go: "Let's kill, to kill Ukrainians mercilessly, as many as we can," said Podolyak.

He believes that "Russia in this form is absolute evil."

“It is not just a Russian state, but a Russian community. It sincerely demonstrates what it is internally. And so we cannot look at them with normal behavior. One that is inherent in the modern world. No, we have to win in the war in order for them to be in fear of perennials forward. And when they see the word "Ukraine" that they may already be soaked, apologize, the trousers sat, etc. ”, - said the adviser to the head of the OP.

According to him, the Russians should be afraid that they will be mercilessly punished.

"Therefore, for me, for example, there are no other ways to come to the end of this war, except for the loss of Russia, fixing the legally of this loss, is tough enough," Podolyak said.

He believes that "it is not necessary to expect that they will behave in a different way."

“And, of course, on June 1 it was finally recorded that Russia has nothing to do Russia. It's all fiction. All these are: "We are there on June 1, We celebrate children's Day." No, this is not all. They celebrate Children's Day, and "The Day of Murder of Children". This is an official holiday, I will say, the official holiday of Russia - "Day of Murder of Children" June 1, " - emphasized the head of the OP.As reported [Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-kyiv/3716810-policia-utocnila-informaciu-pro-zagiblih-u-kievi-dvoe-zinok-i-devatiricna-ditina.html), in Kiev, three people were killed as a result of the attack of the Russian Federation, including a child who tried to get into a closed -fingered stomach during air anxiety.

** Dear Ukrainians!**

This long and hard day is being completed.

First of all, my condolences to the relatives and relatives of whose lives were taken away by Russia.

We do the maximum to protect people. There was no such international meeting, there were no such international negotiations that would not raise the issue of the issue of Ukraine.

But protecting people is protection at all levels. The shelter should be available. The situation should no longer be repeated as this night in Kiev, when people came to the shelter and the shelter is closed. It is a duty of local departments, a very specific duty - to ensure the availability and availability of plates around the clock. It hurts to see a negligent attitude to this duty. It seems to see losses. And if the duty on the ground is not fulfilled, it is a direct obligation to law enforcement officers - to be held accountable.

Today in our country, as in many other countries, there is a day of protection of children. But on this day, the terrorist state claimed the life of the Ukrainian child. But on this day, Russia fired at our cities - from Kharkiv Daherson, from Kiev to Donbass. But we also used this day to the maximum to be defeated by terrorists. And this day became a time when we are approaching the responsibility of Russia - every murderer, every terrorist.

Our Ukrainian delegation - in Moldova at the Summit -European Political Community. Now here is the center of political discussions in the continent. There were very important negotiations. Moldova President of France, Prime Minister and the President of the European Commission, President of Romania and Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister Albania and Prime Minister of Northern Majoria, premiere of Italy, President of Azer, President of Swiss, President, President, President, President.

There was also an extended format with representatives of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Britain, Poland, Belgium. And, of course, meetings in the fields of the summit and jointly ascending all participants of the summit ...And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us by these points. This only support for Ukraine is the support of real security for all of Europe.

Separately, I want to thank Ms. Ursuli von Der Lyen, the President of the European Commission, to retain our initiatives to protect our children, to find and return little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who were deported to Russia. We have to return them all, we have to do everything possible and impossible to protect all people-to the maximum-from any Russian threats. I am sure that it is not enough.

I would like to thank President Michelle, the President of the European Council, held a special security session within the summit.

And separately I would like to thank Roberti Motzoli, the head of the European Parliament, a wearing decision on ammunition for Ukraine - with the support of the allocation of an additional 500 million euros for this. Thank you!

Thank you all our soldiers!Thank you all who train our warriors!Who helps weapons!Who treats our heroes after injuries!I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the SES and other services that eliminate the consequences of Russia!I thank all the volunteers who help our warriors, our bride, our country!

I thank everyone with whom we go side by side to our victory, to our peace and the help of Russian terrorists.

**Glory to Ukraine!**

This opinion was expressed by the representative of the Muslim Congress of Ukraine as a maidakhmetovtov during the "round table" in Ukrinform on the topic: "Ukraine and the Global South: Searching for Ways of Cooperation".

"If we talk about certain practical developments, it is very important to organize advocacy trips to different countries of the global south, where representatives of public or religious organizations of Ukraine are obligatory to enter. This is that in Ukraine one of the indigenous peoples of the Yemlim people [Crimean Tatars](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-krimski-tatari)", - said Saidakhmetov.

He added that this should also be taken into account in the formation of information policy, since Muslims of the Global South are perceived by Ukraine primarily as a duties.

"The minimum they feel when they hear that there are indigenous people in Ukraine, it is a surprise, and then it is possible to set up some to expand this context, because in fact, in addition to the political level, in most of these states - for example, in Turkey, for example, in Turkey, for example.

However, the calculation of the Russians that such actions they will be able to achieve this, it turns out to be ignorant, and if they taught history, they would understand that only enhanced and hatred and consolidate Ukrainians. This opinion was expressed in [comments of Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3716686-bilse-20-nicnih-atak-voroga-u-travni-aki-nastroi-sered-ukrainciv-fiksuut-psihologi-i-sociologi.html)Doctor of Philosophy, Professor, Director of the Institute of Sociology of NAS of Ukraine Yevgeny Golovakha.

“At least in 1939, when the Second World War began, it was the Nazis to the UK. And, in fact, it was hoped that the constant night bombing of Lndon would make the British be more perceived as German conditions, ”the expert said.

According to him, such actions are reached by the Russians, because, first, they consolidate Ukrainians, and secondly, they strengthen our understanding that they will use such methods of aggression with attempts to destroy infrastructure and peaceful people, especially Ukrainians will seek. It is not possible to stop any price because peace is impossible as long as they exist as a predatory and crazy country.

At the same time, according to Golovakha, in the psychological aspect, it all has consequences for Ukrainian. According to the sociological data, which the scientist cited, full-scale entry showed significant psychological consequences last year-if only 4% of people were constantly seen by horrors and nightmares in a dream, in the fall of 20122, this happened with almost a third of Ukrainians. The permanent Stanvoga was 10%before the war, and in the fall of 2022 this figure increased to 40%.

This was stated by the founder of the Save Ukraine Rescue Network, the former Presidential Officer of Ukraine Mykola Kuleba, informs [Ukrainian Radio](http://ukr.radio/news.html?newsID=101559&fbclid=IwAR04gyzdUYs3uxw1nAZaN6DhSbHYa1-1xzQTWj3hjq-KhSJUtyrITJFFds0), reports Ukrinform.

According to him, the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights tries to find any opportunity to communicate with the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation to return Ukrainian children. Kuleba specified that this is what he knows, Alvin believes that these attempts are not enough.

“Therefore, I understand how difficult it is for the official Ukrainian side today, public authorities to try to communicate somehow, because they communicate with a reference that kills, teaches children, deport them. How can you negotiate at all? But according to international norms, just in such situations, the aggressor should transfer information about the children to the third party. How much I know, Switzerland should be a mediator, but Russia rejected any attempts to become other countries, ”he said.

The former Children's Ombudsman informed that the FSB is currently opposing the SaveUkraine Foundation and the return of Ukrainian children.

“And we see that [Russia](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)Genocide, war crimes continue. For this, everyone who does it is Putin, Belova Tavi, others who make decisions, and those who execute them will be responsible for the pre -tribunal tribunal and will be convicted, ”Kuleba is convinced.

According to him, the Save Ukraine Fund returned about 120 children. But he believes that, compared to how many children were stolen by Russians, it is almost a little.

“Therefore, of course, international organizations work to now establish Russia in genocide in genocide ... this evidence, cases(Mass deportation of Children of the Ukrainian to Russia - ed.)should be presented in the tribunal and the decision must be issued. The way was the decision on the arrest of Belova and Putin. But cestioned arrest. That is, this decision has not yet been made about genocide, so first, Putin and Belov should appear in court, ”said the former children's Ombudsman.As it was reported, on May 31, Lubinets stated that the Russian Federation, killing Ukrainian children, was trying to kill the future of Ukraine.

A permanent representative of Ukraine at the Uonsergius Kislytsa said this in a comment to Ukrinform.

He said that in 1996, the UN introduced the post of special representative of the IEntaries for Children and Armed Conflict.

13 resolutions of the Council contain a requirement for the UN system, including the general representative of the Secretary -General, to collect and check the information of proposed children, to use it in the annual report of the Secretary General, to name conflictisters that commit gross violations against children, to conduct a dialogue with these. The pasattaging them.

According to Kislytsia, the Security Council identified six gross violations against children during armed conflict, which are the basis for inclusion in the reporting representative. These are, in particular, recruitment and use of children, murder of Tarasalism, sexual abuse, attacks on schools and hospitals, abduction of children, refusal of humanitarian access.

Kyslytsa stressed that Ukraine expects specific results of the Secretary General's activity [UN](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon)Virginia Gamba, in particular from her trip to Russia, where she met with the authorized right of children in Maria Lviv-Belova.

“We expect to see the specific results of the Special Representative Tour, namely that [RF](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)It will stop crimes against Ukrainian children and constructively promote the return of deported children to Ukraine, ”he said.

Postpred reminded that Gamba visited Ukraine in early May, where she had a nestle with Ukrainian high -ranking officials. In mid-May, she also looked in Russia, where she had a very controversial meeting with Lviv-Bielova, which "expected a wave of indignation, in particular, among a human rights community, and not only", he added.

Kislytsya emphasized that the most effective way to prevent crimes against children is to hold all violators and provision of fairness for the victims.

Postpred emphasized that it is the duty of the international community, so it is necessary to "consolidate efforts and to combat these most disgusting war and crimes against humanity.""At the same time, we see that Russia continues to use hunger as a digest, blocking Ukrainian seaports, destroying agricultural infrastructure, polluting agricultural land," Postpred said.

According to him, in countries where conflicts have been ongoing - Yemen, Somali, Afghanistan and Syria - "the main thing for protecting children is to solve famine."

In particular, in Somalia, 43 thousand people died of starvation last year, half of whom children died. Another 18,000 can die within half a year if appropriate international assistance will be provided. In total, about 1.8 million children under the age of five are affected in this country.

In Yemen, 2.2 million children are significantly malnourished, and more than 540 thousand are starving. In general, more than 11 thousand has been killed or crippled. children.

In Afghanistan, 35,000 children have been killed during the conflict, which has been ongoing since 2001. After the Taliban seized the Taliban in August 2021, the situation of the children worsened significantly. Today, according to UNICEF, 100%of children in a country of almost 13 million need humanitarian aid. Hunger is the cause of 45% of children's deaths. Due to the inaccessibility of elementary medical care, 212 children die every day.

"I cited these horrible numbers to show how critically important the grain initiative that Russia blocks in every possible way," Kislytsya emphasized.

** Dear Ukrainians!**

This long and hard day is being completed.

First of all, my condolences to the relatives and relatives of whose lives were taken away by Russia.

We do the maximum to protect people. There was no such international meeting, there were no such international negotiations that would not raise the issue of the issue of Ukraine.

But protecting people is protection at all levels. The shelter should be available. The situation should no longer be repeated as this night in Kiev, when people came to the shelter and the shelter is closed. It is a duty of local departments, a very specific duty - to ensure the availability and availability of plates around the clock. It hurts to see a negligent attitude to this duty. It seems to see losses. And if the duty on the ground is not fulfilled, it is a direct obligation to law enforcement officers - to be held accountable.

Today in our country, as in many other countries, there is a day of protection of children. But on this day, the terrorist state claimed the life of the Ukrainian child. But on this day, Russia fired at our cities - from Kharkiv Daherson, from Kiev to Donbass. But we also used this day to the maximum to be defeated by terrorists. And this day became a time when we are approaching the responsibility of Russia - every murderer, every terrorist.

Our Ukrainian delegation - in Moldova at the Summit -European Political Community. Now here is the center of political discussions in the continent. There were very important negotiations. Moldova President of France, Prime Minister and the President of the European Commission, President of Romania and Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister Albania and Prime Minister of Northern Majoria, premiere of Italy, President of Azer, President of Swiss, President, President, President, President.

There was also an extended format with representatives of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Britain, Poland, Belgium. And, of course, meetings in the fields of the summit and jointly ascending all participants of the summit ...And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us by these points. This only support for Ukraine is the support of real security for all of Europe.

Separately, I want to thank Ms. Ursuli von Der Lyen, the President of the European Commission, to retain our initiatives to protect our children, to find and return little Ukrainians and Ukrainian women who were deported to Russia. We have to return them all, we have to do everything possible and impossible to protect all people-to the maximum-from any Russian threats. I am sure that it is not enough.

I would like to thank President Michelle, the President of the European Council, held a special security session within the summit.

And separately I would like to thank Roberti Motzoli, the head of the European Parliament, a wearing decision on ammunition for Ukraine - with the support of the allocation of an additional 500 million euros for this. Thank you!

Thank you all our soldiers!Thank you all who train our warriors!Who helps weapons!Who treats our heroes after injuries!I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the SES and other services that eliminate the consequences of Russia!I thank all the volunteers who help our warriors, our bride, our country!

I thank everyone with whom we go side by side to our victory, to our peace and the help of Russian terrorists.

**Glory to Ukraine!**

He expressed this opinion in an interview "[Channel 24](https://24tv.ua/gromadyanska-viyna-rozval-shho-chekaye-rosiyu-mihaylo-podolyak_n2326010?fbclid=IwAR1iMplwVpW-j6TTOyj0ksiNmUsHC0T_dUH1otQdfC5La7BFlsKYQmomeKE)”, Reports Ukrinform.

Commenting on the shelling of Russia on the Day of Children's Defense, Podolyak noted that [RF](https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia)shows his true face.

“They are like that. They were like that. They were masked for a long time, they always used to be propaganda to disguise their hateful sincere attitude around. And above all, to us. But they use this time that has fallen to them, the last summer to kill as many common people they hate as possible. That is, they are no longer masking anything, they are frank in their propaganda narratives, you see on the playgrounds, they will go: "Let's kill, to kill Ukrainians mercilessly, as many as we can," said Podolyak.

He believes that "Russia in this form is absolute evil."

“It is not just a Russian state, but a Russian community. It sincerely demonstrates what it is internally. And so we cannot look at them with normal behavior. One that is inherent in the modern world. No, we have to win in the war in order for them to be in fear of perennials forward. And when they see the word "Ukraine" that they may already be soaked, apologize, the trousers sat, etc. ”, - said the adviser to the head of the OP.

According to him, the Russians should be afraid that they will be mercilessly punished.

"Therefore, for me, for example, there are no other ways to come to the end of this war, except for the loss of Russia, fixing the legally of this loss, is tough enough," Podolyak said.

He believes that "it is not necessary to expect that they will behave in a different way."

“And, of course, on June 1 it was finally recorded that Russia has nothing to do Russia. It's all fiction. All these are: "We are there on June 1, We celebrate children's Day." No, this is not all. They celebrate Children's Day, and "The Day of Murder of Children". This is an official holiday, I will say, the official holiday of Russia - "Day of Murder of Children" June 1, " - emphasized the head of the OP.As reported [Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-kyiv/3716810-policia-utocnila-informaciu-pro-zagiblih-u-kievi-dvoe-zinok-i-devatiricna-ditina.html), in Kiev, three people were killed as a result of the attack of the Russian Federation, including a child who tried to get into a closed -fingered stomach during air anxiety.

She tries to submit to the Russian inhabitant a "delay" with his premium as evidence of the weakness of the enemy and the indomitability of the positions of own army, [reports](https://www.facebook.com/protydiyadezinformatsiyi.cpd/posts/pfbid0yNaoJjcAon1yTXCZDZ9JBFkvx2VFWED9nA5xAo1CtNQ1oTTjdAijTotcg9ukMJ74l)The Center for Combating Misinformation on Facebook Page.

The propagandists began a real information attack, seeking to prove the Russian audience hypertrophied information about the final "bleeding" of Ukrainians and the same voiceful statements about the effective destruction of Western equipment.

Information preparation of the Russians for the future offensive of the Armed Forces provides for the subsequent theses in their consciousness.

** First, the ** The Ukrainian army allegedly has no counter-offensive, and the statements of the gap-nothing more than a "reception" for "asking" new supplies of Western. In order to give "authority" propaganda actively manipulates the estimates of the "former US Navy officer, Professor of the School of Public Tamzhnaya International Relations of Georgia University Colonel James". In publications of the Propaganda media(lenta.ru)The reference to this "expert" states that "Ukrainian leaders use the future offensive as weigh to support the supply of Western weapons." In fact, the expert does not exist, and the links are taken to Dr. James Holmes blog(really a former US Navy officer), which does not contain assessments of the Armed Forces, but only the Ukrainian counter -offensive has already begun.** Third, ** is moving as an indisputable thesis that Russia allegedly successfully reduces the equipment of the Armed Forces both in combat positions and on the path of its supply, as a result of which the Ukrainian army simply does not have enough heavy arms for offensive actions. However, objective confirmations of this word, and the data of the Oryx portal, which calculates only photo fixations of losses of equipment, show - in daily mode more heavy weapons lose the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The British intelligence believes that the Russian command tries to form the reserve forces and place them where, in their opinion, the Ukrainian counter -offensive can be able to resolve. But this prevents the need to throw reserves on the front line in Bakhmut and the border areas of the Bryansk and Bryansk regions after Ukrainian operations in the "gray zone". Incarnation to falling discipline in its benches.

It all testifies that the Kremlin recognizes the success of the Ukrainian contrast and tries to mitigate the demoralization of Russian society with the introduction of the fall of the authorities, as it was after the military failures of the RFN Kherson and Kharkiv region.

However, despite the manipulative "tricks", the topic of discrediting the Ukrainian contrast remains a weak link in Russian propaganda. Independent information on the Internet, which the Russians are increasingly trusting, proving notes opposite to the official Kremlin narratives. Namely - the agenda of the game at the front is actually dictated by Ukraine, and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are only passively resort to that the enemy will not reserve on the counterattack. Even the most aggressive propagandists do not risk proving the ability of the Russian Army to only new breakthroughs, but also to the maintenance of already occupied Ukrainian territories. The threats of the Russian General and individual warriors to defeat the Ukrainian counter -offensive look as a mockery of themselves against themselves in the past year near Kiev, Kharkov and Kherson. Even the leader of the Wagnerians is. Prigogine, commenting on the desire of Russian propaganda to increase the successes of the Russian Army and humiliate the combat qualities of the Armed Forces, called such a recipe for defeat, and acknowledged that "the Ukrainian army is preparing and showing quite good results."

Much attention was paid to the tragic cases of the death of our defenders in captivity. They become known mainly after exchange of bodies. During the identification, it turns out that they returned the body of the person who was captured.

“Also, some cases of death becomes known from those who have returned from the ground. Russia does not report such cases, ”said the headquarters representative.

"When we find such facts, we register criminal proceedings, conducting a model investigation, as far as possible during hostilities," the National Police Representative said. - After the release of occupied land investigations will be continued. Cases of death in captivity qualify as the violations of the laws and customs of war. "

"The power of the state that holds the prisoners must take care of a decent burial so that the body could then be taken away," the ICCH representative said. - We passed the information in captivity to the Russian side and waiting for answers. The captivity in captivity is responsible for holding the country that holds. When the crime is already committed, the ICCH is condemned, but international courts. We are ready to provide more assistance, and no side of the conflict should be hindered. We will not calm down will reach the desired. "

According to a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during each international meeting both within the framework of the state organizations and bilateral contacts, Ukraine raises two main issues - the return of Russia and prisoners exported by Russia.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T53-00-00-04-00/8-2-scaled.jpg)Last week, the Russian army, as always, demonstrated the world of a miserable plant of its equipment and inefficiency of management, trying to keep the space -heated territories solely by replenishing the numerical composition with new parties of cannon meat.

It was due to the large number of assault detachments, not their viciousness, that the enemy tried to move on the Kupyansk, Lyman Taavdiivsky directions. Expected - there was no success, he suffered losses. The divisional Guard of Ukraine, which perform combat and special tasks of complications of defense forces of Ukraine, was not allowed in these areas of losses.

About it during [briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfnjT8q0xNg)VMILITARY MEDIA CENTER was informed by the Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the Main Directorate of NSU Colonel Mykola Urshalovich.

In the Kharkiv direction, the enemy attempted to find weak places in uniform defense, using sabotage and intelligence groups from the cross-section of the state border. As a result of effective contradictory measures with the participation of units of NSU, the enemy suffered losses and departed.

In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy moved to the defense on the ruins of self -made settlements.

In the Zaporizhzhya and Kherson directions, the situation did not undergo significant changes. The significant impact on the course of hostilities this week had weather conditions there - in particular, heavy cloudiness and showers significantly complicated the conduct of air intelligence and correction of artillery fire, and also limited the passage of engineering on soil roads. At the same time, all the tasks of the Guards were fulfilled.

On ** Shakhtarsky ** the occupiers were unsuccessfully advanced in the direction of thewaggledar. Due to the lack of any achievements on the battlefield, they occupy the shelling of our positions near the Great Novosilka Donetsk region.

Instead, the Guards continued to cause loss of the enemy in the power of the tacitics. Last week, the units of the National Guard were neutralized by about 170 invaders, 67 of them "disposed of forever"; destroyed armored vehicles and artillery weapons with calculations.

NSU intelligence officers found 338 enemy goals, some of which were destroyed in cooperation with the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T53-00-00-04-00/3-1.jpg)He also said that the national artillerymen during the week completed 260 firing tasks, which were neutralized by 70 enemy people, destroyed three artis systems, automobile equipment and three ammunition depots.

NSU aircraft made 4 combat missions for the enemy fire. As the result-the enemy lost 40 invaders, PTRC and AGS-17 with calculations, a warehouse with ammunition, a platoon stronghold. - In the Zaporizhzhya Tachson directions, our units of unmanned aviation were carried out to perform intelligence tasks, which showed the CAU, artillery system, three combat armored vehicles, boat, 17 car vehicles. But the coordinates for their fire damage were provided, - said Mykola Urshalovich.

Last week, it was also effective for air defense units, so the National Guard was landed 5 air purposes. In particular, the razor shooters in the area of small Tokmachka from the Igla MSC were knocked down by a pilot-25, from which the pilot was catapult and the other Su-25 was damaged.

Розглядаючи впливцифрового світу на ментальне здоров’я дітей і підлітків, слід ставити собіпитання: хто ким управляє? За статистикою, близько 80% підлітків засинають згаджетами в руках, що призводить до порушення якості сну, а сон — це одна зключових передумов ментального здоров’я.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T80-00-00-04-00/prez111.jpeg)Every time decisions are being prepared and made for the sake of Europe, for the sake of values, it is necessary to remember that every doubt here in Europe is a trench that is obliged to occupy Russia.

About it [stated](https://www.president.gov.ua/news/kozhen-sumniv-u-yevropi-ce-okop-yakij-obovyazkovo-sprobuye-z-83305)The President of Ukraine during a speech of the meeting of the European Political Community.

“Every doubt brings more danger. Whether doubts about vital steps, whether doubts about our unity with you, or doubts, with your ability to answer the challenges of time, ”he stressed.

According to the Head of State, from February 24 last year the boundaries of security in Europe are literally the limits of determination, the ability to act together for the sake of the people of the whole Europe.

“As far as we can discard doubts, we can also reject misappression. There are no ones among us who do not know what decisions are now needed by Europe.

The first is full protection against Russian terror. Both on earth and in the sky.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T80-00-00-04-00/prez22.jpeg)This night, Russian missiles took three more lives in our capital, in Kiev. Ten people were injured. One child was killed - in addition to hundreds killed by Russian terror earlier. At least 484 Ukrainian children are killed.

There are two decisive components. This is a Petriot coalition that will end the Isro -sharant of ballistic missiles. And the second is a coalition of modern closers, which will prove that terror against our cities has no chance. And I thank you who helps, those who understand that the speed of formation of these two -coalitions - "Petriots" and fighters is literally accelerating peace.

The second is the full power of our unity. We see who is the aggressor. We see where the aggression is exactly. Russia is afraid of NATO is true - and tries to swallow those who are outside the common security space. And Russia tries to leave the territory of the neighbors of the "frozen" war, if it is not possible to swallow the entire country.

For example, why the Russian contingent is still in Transnistria? The Kremlin is a dawn to "thaw" an attack on Moldova one day. How long will the Europe will endure? The issue has been 30 years. It should be answered.

There should be no "frozen" or hot war on our continent!We see what is happening in Belarus. We see what happens in Georgia. We see how these peoples are delayed-though differently-but in the same peak. But what do they see?

Even if the Ukrainians, who prove their commitment to freedom and valuables of united Europe, have not yet heard a clear positive answer to the EU and NATO, then the hopes of others become quite ghostly. Imagine this frustration. The disappointment and our warriors for freedom, and those for whom our struggle in Ukraine is their hope.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T80-00-00-04-00/prez33.jpeg)This year is for decisions. And this is the third point where I would like to emphasize.

In the summer in Vilnius, the NATO summit requires a clear invitation of Ukraine to Ukraine, as well as security guarantees on the way to NATO membership. The fall is a clear positive decision on our accession to the EU. We also prepare Samitmir, which directs the world to the realization of our formula of peace. And a brick need. Time has come and doubts must disappear.

Positive solutions for Ukraine will be positive solutions for all. The security basis. Obviously - for Moldova. It is very important. In the future, for Georgia. I have no doubt that over time - for Belarus. And therefore, for the European peace. Because there will be no doubt for aggression against someone in Europe.

And I thank all of you who understand that Europe should be just as far -sighted in order to be truly peaceful.

The Ukrainian approach is obvious and open. We openly proposed a formula of peace, and its points are obvious. We are openly talking about the importance of NATO and the relationship between reducing our doubts and the expansion of our space safety. We openly say that only a strong air defense, namely a coalition of "Petriots", namely a coalition of modern fighters, can be able to interpret Russian terror. It is a reality in which we live and fight daily. This is the openness on which our Europe is based, one of our main common principles. These are facts, obvious facts. Openness and honesty. Now we are making the necessary solutions.

He recalled that the war began not in 2022, but much earlier in 2014. Therefore, it is necessary to do everything possible to prevent the Russian Federation after the end of the war, to regroup and to attack again after a few months of Chirok.

- In order to stop this cycle, we must provide long -term support for Ukraine, implement different programs, as we discussed, and look at what we will have a structure and what mechanisms we will have to provide the necessary security guarantees so that the Russian Federation does not start attacking Ukraine again, In order not to undermine European security, - the Alliance Secretary General emphasized.

![](Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-01T92-00-00-04-00/volodyayaya.png)This long and hard day is being completed.

First of all, my condolences to the relatives and relatives of whose lives were taken away by Russia.

We do the maximum to protect people. There was no such international meeting, there were no such international negotiations that would not raise the issue of the issue of Ukraine.

But protection of people is protection at all levels. The shelter should be available. The situation should no longer happen again as this night in Kiev, when people came to the shelter and the shelter is closed. It is a duty of local departments, a very specific duty - to ensure the availability and availability of plates around the clock. It hurts to see a negligent attitude to this duty. It seems to see losses. And if the duty on the ground is not fulfilled, it is a direct obligation to law enforcement officers - to be held liable.

Today in our country, as in many other countries, there is a day of protection of children. But on this day, the terrorist state claimed the life of the Ukrainian child. But on this day, Russia fired at our cities - from Kharkiv Daherson, from Kiev to Donbass. But we also used this day to the maximum to be defeated by terrorists. And this day became a time when we bring the responsibility of Russia - every murderer, every terrorist.

Our Ukrainian delegation - in Moldova at the Summit -European Political Community. Now here is the Center for Political Discussions by the continent. There were very important negotiations. Moldova President of France, Prime Minister and the President of the European Commission, President of Romania and Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister Albania and Prime Minister of Northern Majoria, premiere of Italy, President of Azer, President of Swiss, President, President, President, President.

There was also an extended format with representatives of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Britain, Poland, Belgium. And, of course, meetings in the fields of the summit and jointly ascending all participants of the summit ...

We are preparing new defensive solutions for Ukraine - this applies to air defense and aviation, and other promotion on Earth. We are preparing a real political content for Natu Vilnius summit. We are preparing a security package for our country on the way of Valiance. We do our best to bring the political decision of the European Union on the Svetwan of Ukraine. We prepare the peace of peace based on the Ukrainian formula of peace.

And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us by these points. This only support for Ukraine is the support of real security for all of Europe.I would like to thank President Michelle, the President of the European Council, held a special security session within the summit.

And separately I would like to thank Roberti Motzoli, the head of the European Parliament, a weed decision on ammunition for Ukraine - with the support of the allocation of an additional 500 million euros for this. Thank you!

Thank you all our soldiers!Thank you all who train our warriors!Who helps weapons!Who treats our heroes after injuries!I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the SES and other services that eliminate the consequences of Russia!I thank all the volunteers who help our warriors, our bride, our country!

I thank everyone with whom we go side by side to our victory, to our peace and the help of Russian terrorists.

Anna Malyar said that it could be an example of a nervous reaction to other events. In the information space, the theme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was actively covered, and the Russians had a panic influence.

- Indeed in the east of our country, they tried to step from the New Year to 4 more - now they added 2 more, but nothing works. The Russians are constantly advised to give their tasks, for example, to get out on the turn of the Lugansk and Donetsk region, so the program they have set themselves after they did not realize Kiev, they could not implement, - said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine.

In addition, she added that the enemy is definitely looking for other paths to still be Ukraine and many of their steps are due to distorting a psychological equilibrium and demoralized.
