<p>About it in your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smPw_2txVnE">appeal</a>At the end of the 465th day of the war said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reports Ukrinform.</p>
<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUkkIiHzdc">op</a></em></p>
<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Almost every night, in such appeals, I thank our soldiers - specific units, specific brigades that have distinguished themselves most on the forefront or the image of our sky a day or a week.</p>
<p>And today - more personal thanks, specific soldiers.</p>
<p>We must remember everyone that our defense, our active actions and independence of Ukraine is not something abstract. These are very specific people, specific actions of specific heroes, through which Ukraine will be Ukraine. Thousands and thousands of the most sound, brave, our most accurate people ...</p>
<p>Such as Soldier Yaroslav Kan, our warrior warrior. He fought in the hottest points. Bigorivka, Lisichansk Defense, Soledar Defense. Fighting for Svatovo, Kreminna, Bakhmut ... Four wounds!Now treatment is undergoing treatment, restores. And ready to return to the front again. This is the extraordinary power of man!Thank you, Yaroslav!</p>
<p>Senior Sergeant Yevgeny Kepsha, commander of the platoon department of anti -tank missile complexes. Bakhmut fighting. PTRK "Stugna". Very well, very bold. Together with the Skhlopians, along with their brothers from their calculation - very good results of reducing the invaders. Thank you for that, Eugene!</p>
<p>Senior Sergeant Maxim Kuzmenko and junior sergeant Anton Andrushchenko-soldiers of the110th separate mechanized brigade. Fighting in the Avdeevsky direction. Very fierce battles. Constant hostile assault. And this is the result of Ukraine needed by Ukraine. Thank you guys!</p>
<p>Many times I thanked our soldiers from the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". The boys are all the good. They fight very powerfully, foolish. And today I will note the artillery battery with the collection of Captain Mykola Nosach. Avdeevsky direction. Russian assaults are very well. Exactly what is needed. Thank you, Nicholas!Very pleasantly to report on your accuracy.Our glorious 35th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade named Michaelostrogradsky ... In almost every day of the fighting, boys deserve a drink. And today I would like to celebrate the whole 1st battalion of the Marines Brigade separately. Thank each of you guys!Your strength is an example for everyone.</p>
<p>And the defenders of our sky. Such as soldier Anatoliy Pavlenko, the National Guard. The Storm Division of the storm. A guy who is able to get Russian rockets extremely aptly - and with the help of just Igla MSr. Thank you for the swing!</p>
<p>Usually we thank the warriors who defend our cities from Russian terror because of powerful air defense systems: "Petriots", "nonsense", "Iris" and others. And it is absolutely fair - they saved a lot of lives of our people, a lot .</p>
<p>However, important - and effective!- Warriors of our firing maneuverable groups that intercede various civilian and military objects. As for example, senior state Viktor Sidnev is a senior one of these maneuverable groups working for the protection of Kiev. Excellent coordination of actions, excellent combat skills. And Jewsult is minus the occupiers' missiles. Thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you all who are in battle for Ukraine!Thank you all who are at combat posts and assignments!Thank you all who constantly train our warriors, and everyone who trees our heroes after injuries!</p>
<p>And I ask you all: please do not forget to thank you personally to our warriors. You know who you know personally. Those you may just have been signed by the Wester networks. To those you just heard and can tell other Ukrainians, our people. Gratitude is always important, and it is important to hear that you are grateful when you are fighting for your people.</p>
<p>_ <strong> Glory to all our heroes!</strong> _</p>
<p>_<strong>Glory to Ukraine!</strong> _</p>

<p>He said this during a speech at the Shanngry-La Dialogue forum, Verzhapuri, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>In his speech, the Minister, in particular, noted that in this year's forum, the numerous delegation of high-ranking heads of defense of European states was involved in this year's forum, and this, in his opinion, is evidence of the importance of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>He then went to the Ukrainian theme, noting that "events in Ukraine" affect a large number of people around the world, as prices have increased dramatically food and energy, and formulated his own "peace plan": "First, immediately stop fire and fighting. . Secondly, to breed troops of the side side 15 kilometers from the current line of the front and to create a demytilized zone, and the third, to create under the auspices <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-oon">UN</a>A peacekeeping mission that will monitor the ceasefire regime. "</p>
<p>After that, Subianto proposes to organize and hold referendums with "controversial territories" in order to "objectively establish the will of the majority of disputed territories" regarding the vision of their future.</p>
<p>He assured that Indonesia was ready to send its representatives to such a non -human mission of the UN.</p>
<p>"I do not know if my proposal is acceptable, but these are specific recommendations for the forum for the fastest de -escalation and termination of bloodshed in this armed conflict," Subianto said.</p>

<p>Europe, as we know, is one, and at the same time - varied. But how diverse, sometimes we even forget. We just don't imagine.</p>
<p>So here you can choose to listen to our story on Spotify or other subconscious platforms:</p>
<p>Or in the video format on the Ukrinform YouTube channel.</p>
<p>We will listen to musicians from different European countries. Known and not very. One thing is one thing - a complete indulgence in a stereotypical idea of a musical scene. For example, France is Chanson, Britain-Rock and Roll, Germany-Ramstein, and Italy is a solid San Remo ... We promise surprises for this drug menu.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-03T11-40-00-03-00/1685780942-207.png" /></p>
<p>Як вам, наприклад, таке: британська група, у складі якої немає жодногобританця, співає пісню американського крунера про бразильську каву у країні,де існує заледве не культ чаю…</p>
<p>Або ж слухаєте джазовий стандарт Sweet Georgia Brown, а чуєте симпатичну сумішсвінгу, рокабілі, джазу та панківської відв’язності? І ніякого шансону, хочазвучить все це, так, з Парижу...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-03T11-40-00-03-00/1685780946-594.png" />Is it a collage: an Austrian vocalist, Chilean accompanies and an outstanding flutist. And all this is recorded at the German studio with its company "Interests".</p>
<p>So adjust to paradoxes. About Germany in German, about Beni Andersen Slidegive Swedish band Abba, who was known at the Motherland by another style, about Roxette soloist Marie Fredrixon, who you do not know her, the pronewal adventures of Hit Hungary Omega, the same, not only, not only sperpions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/yкринформ/2023-06-03T11-40-00-03-00/1685780944-569.png" />One word, traditionally: listen to us - do not listen ...</p>
<p>Unless you will return to the podcasts already recorded, you will remember what you seemed to be the most interesting. And in the meantime we will write new "Musical Stories", watch ...</p>

<p>He said this in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8SKQuCruro">interview</a>For Latin American media, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“I am not for the first time in public and not public, through someone, through the media and the President Luli, and I can again confirm once again - I am interested in the Utilities with President Lula. I am interested in having a meeting. He was in any format. I invited the President repeatedly, invited a visit to Ukraine. We connected with the President Lula's team when he met in Spain, Portugal, he was in Europe, I think about this time because the distance is smaller and I want him to find. Then I had different meetings at the G7, and even someone said we were unfamiliar ... It's a beacon. It is even uninterest to listening to it when someone speaks about it- frivolous and unremitting people. I am interested in meeting with the President. And I think we need to talk, ”Zelensky said.</p>
<p>According to the head of the Ukrainian state, he needs "to support Ukraine or not support Russia in this situation as possible, if they are ready to support Ukraine, unfortunately."</p>
<p>“It is very important for me that people understand all the details of what is happening. For me, it is very important for people to be involved, big powers. It is a large state - in fact, in power, a representative of Latin America - Brazil. And that Brazil is also at the level of other states in the formula of peace, the world of peace is presented.

<p>This belief was expressed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8SKQuCruro">interview</a>Representatives of the Amlatin American media are transmitted by Ukrinform correspondent.</p>
<p>"First of all(necessary)It is real to evaluate what is happening in Ukraine, to evaluate what a war is, to assess whether it is fair that Russia has attacked us and every day all living things. ... <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-antirosijski-sankcii">sanctions</a>... Important to isolate the Kremlin's authoritarian rule and his desperation to capture Ukraine and return everything to the Soviet Union. Sanctions are tools from tools. So I say that first we need to understand what is here, and then, when people learn the whole truth, people will propose themselves: let's somehow influence, let's stop the Kremlin, stop this, suffering people, ”the president said.</p>
<p>He noted that in Latin America, which had a close connection of the Soviet Union, there was no understanding that the countries that were in the cephaeting at one time have chosen independence.</p>
<p>At the same time, Zelensky noted "some progress", because people abroad began to understand that the war in Ukraine is not civil - it is a war of Russia against Ukraine, which is forced to conduct defense actions.</p>

<p>“And before that, to be honest. But it seems to me as tired of the Russians, no one is tired. It seems to me that they are tired morally. It seems to me that they are tired morally scary, they are shocked that they are not able to still seize Ukraine, they could not capture the mind of people.

<p>This opinion was expressed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8SKQuCruro">interview</a>Latin American media, Ukrinform correspondent reports.</p>
<p>“Depends on <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia">Russia</a>- military(by - ed.)We de -navigate the territory or not, and only from Russia. And today our partners see, and already those countries that were skeptical. For example, Germany. Chancellor Scholtz openly says: “I believe that Russia is… there is no to talk about it until it leaves the territories(Ukraine - ed.)”. Draw the attention - not until Ukraine is dealing with their military, and until Russia works. Therefore, there is a logic for me. If you want to talk to me and talk to a curved world, you should not wait for you to be over. They will be they, ”Zelensky said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he noted that by dealing of the Russian -owned territory of the Russian Federation in the Ukrainian way, we lose our people.</p>
<p>“The question is not in time. We do not get tired for the sake of victory. The question is not in time, the question in people. And if we knock out the force(Russians from Ukraine - ed.), then, believe me, when we will squeeze them out of our territory, what do we talk about with them? What is the point to speak? I think that then Russia will look for themselves other leaders who will be able to find an approach to the whole civilized world, to find the opportunity for people to sit with them at least something to say something, because after they did, no one is ready for dialogue with them. . This is if we knock out the force, so such a big difference, ”said <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-zelenskij">Zelensky</a>.</p>

<p>Zelensky expressed his belief that Ukraine has been depriving its territories to Tann on the importance of what way it would be.</p>
<p>“It is very important to lose people or not to reduce losses. It is very important to me. And then it depends on, again, whether we are ready for any communion, ”the head of the Ukrainian state added.</p>
<p>In his opinion, "any other leadership of the Russian Federation will be looking for a output from this situation."He stressed that the war is taking place in Ukraine, not Russia.</p>
<p>“The war is here. Them(Russians - ed.)I would like to talk that something is reflected in Russia. Nothing is happening there. I will tell you, u have some weapons that we do not use in Russia, because we have stolen us, for example, "Himars", which we have no right to use the gerrulates of other states, Russia. We are talking about Russia today. That is, we use in the territories of our temporarily occupied, so, the impressive goals and affecting some warehouses with ammunition, etc. You already know Russia. If we have a powerfully impressed targets in the Russian Federation, believe me, there would be a lot of casualties. Truth? We see what 50, 100 rockets are, widening for us. We see what sacrifices are visible. And we know what the Russian Federation is. If they had any casualties, believe me, the whole information space would be in this. And this is a fact. They can make a whole information bubble, ”the head of the Ukrainian state said.</p>

<p><em>Viso: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUkkIiHzdc">op</a></em></p>
<p><strong> _ I wish health, dear Ukrainians!_ </strong></p>
<p>Almost every night, in such appeals, I thank our soldiers - specific units, specific brigades that have distinguished themselves most on the forefront or the image of our sky a day or a week.</p>
<p>And today - more personal thanks, specific soldiers.</p>
<p>We must remember everyone that our defense, our active actions and independence of Ukraine is not something abstract. These are very specific people, specific actions of specific heroes, through which Ukraine will be Ukraine. Thousands and thousands of the most sound, brave, our most accurate people ...</p>
<p>Such as Soldier Yaroslav Kan, our warrior warrior. He fought in the hottest points. Bigorivka, Lisichansk Defense, Soledar Defense. Fighting for Svatovo, Kreminna, Bakhmut ... Four wounds!Now treatment is undergoing treatment, restores. And ready to return to the front again. This is the extraordinary power of man!Thank you, Yaroslav!</p>
<p>Senior Sergeant Yevgeny Kepsha, commander of the platoon department of anti -tank missile complexes. Bakhmut fighting. PTRK "Stugna". Very well, very bold. Together with the Skhlopians, along with their brothers from their calculation - very good results of reducing the invaders. Thank you for that, Eugene!</p>
<p>Senior Sergeant Maxim Kuzmenko and junior sergeant Anton Andrushchenko-soldiers of the110th separate mechanized brigade. Fighting in the Avdeevsky direction. Very fierce battles. Constant hostile assault. And this is the result of Ukraine needed by Ukraine. Thank you guys!</p>
<p>Many times I thanked our soldiers from the 55th Artillery Brigade "Zaporizhzhya Sich". The boys are all the good. They fight very powerfully, foolish. And today I will note the artillery battery with the collection of Captain Mykola Nosach. Avdeevsky direction. Russian assaults are very well. Exactly what is needed. Thank you, Nicholas!Very pleasantly to report on your accuracy.Our glorious 35th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade named Michaelostrogradsky ... In almost every day of the fighting, boys deserve a drink. And today I would like to celebrate the whole 1st battalion of the Marines Brigade separately. Thank each of you guys!Your strength is an example for everyone.</p>
<p>And the defenders of our sky. Such as soldier Anatoliy Pavlenko, the National Guard. The Storm Division of the storm. A guy who is able to get Russian rockets extremely aptly - and with the help of just Igla MSr. Thank you for the swing!</p>
<p>Usually we thank the warriors who defend our cities from Russian terror because of powerful air defense systems: "Petriots", "nonsense", "Iris" and others. And it is absolutely fair - they saved a lot of lives of our people, a lot .</p>
<p>However, important - and effective!- Warriors of our firing maneuverable groups that intercede various civilian and military objects. As for example, senior state Viktor Sidnev is a senior one of these maneuverable groups working for the protection of Kiev. Excellent coordination of actions, excellent combat skills. And Jewsult is minus the occupiers' missiles. Thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you all who are in battle for Ukraine!Thank you all who are at combat posts and assignments!Thank you all who constantly train our warriors, and everyone who trees our heroes after injuries!</p>
<p>And I ask you all: please do not forget to thank you personally to our warriors. You know who you know personally. Those you may just have been signed by the Wester networks. To those you just heard and can tell other Ukrainians, our people. Gratitude is always important, and it is important to hear that you are grateful when you are fighting for your people.</p>

Everyone knows that it is very difficult when you cannot protect the baby from the threat. Therefore, when we talk about the defense today, it is first and foremost about literal protection. From death, injuries, suffering, from death.</p>
<p>About this the first lady of Ukraine Elena Zelenskaya <a href="https://t.me/FirstLadyOfUkraine/3277">wrote</a>in telegrams.</p>
<p>Protection of children means that they should not die under the wreckage of rockets and rubble homes. Should not lose health, arms and legs.</p>
<p>The abduction should not be victims - and Russia has exported more than 19,000 our children.</p>
<p>Protection of children means protection against orphanage - that is why, in the most difficult times, Ukraine is moving to family forms of education to get rid of orphanages.</p>
<p>Protection of children means that they should not become forced displaced persons - in their own or in another country. Should not miss the home and loved ones.</p>
<p>Protection of children involves the protection of their right to study and development - they are innocent to study in bomb shelters and to distinguish missiles and drones by sound. And the cesame is what Ukrainian children do.</p>
<p>But this is a danger not only to our children. When a childhood in one country as a rise, it is at risk. It is a challenge to all parents and adults. You can only respond to it together.</p>
<p>-participated in an online mode at the Child Protection Conference(EUsupport for Reconstruction and Reform of Ukraine’s Child Protection System), which takes place in Sweden. According to a memorandum between these instances, Sweden will be a partner of Ukraine in protecting children. I am grateful for this cooperation. We will be able to help not only Ukrainian children, but also childhood in general. In order for a baby in any city in the world she cried at night to the sounds of sirens, ”said Elena Zelenskaya.</p>

<p>The spokesman of the Eastern Urell of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces Colonel Sergey Cherevaty reported this on the air of the Tele scale "Unified News".</p>
<ul>
<li>The enemy lost ten months in time and at various estimates of up to 100 millennium killed and wounded, so that, I emphasize, do not fully seize the Bakhmut district center. They understand that in the case of our lightning operations can get rid of their achievements. And it can become a destabilizing moral and psychological element. Therefore, the Russians do everything to replace the "Wagner" in the Bakhmut area airborne units, which are traditionally seen as an "ambulance" in them in Soviet. And on the events and population of the Belgorod region they are killed. The remnants of military image are more important to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the officer, the Russian Federation conducts rotational events in the Bakhmut direction, which strongly covers artillery fire. During this day, the enemy performed 400 ties and four aircraft.</p>
<ul>
<li>We, for our part, strike the enemy with all possible means, to abuse these rotational measures. So to speak, some are on the road, and other we are wearing, - said Sergey Cherevaty.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/01_veteran.jpg" />The Discussion "Veterans-the Basis of Human Capital of Ukraine" worked in the <a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/2023/05/31/nyni-tryvaye-zakladannya-systemy-upravlinnya-vidnovlennya-ukrayiny-odnogo-z-najbilshyh-modernizaczijnyh-proyektiv-majbutnogo/">Forum of Civil Society "Outline of the Future: Victory, Recovery and Modernization of Ukraine"</a>, which took place in the Art Arsenal. The participants discussed topical issues of Ukraine's development of tomorrow, deveterans are the basis of human capital, since Ukrainian society will already be further or widened by a society with a high specific share of young veterans.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/02-1-1.jpg" />Experts, representatives of state power bodies of Tagnian society took part in the work of the section.</p>
<h3><strong> Case Managers-an effective tool to meet the needs of veterans </strong></h3>
<p>The meeting of the coalition coalition was opened, by the Minister of Vetrans in 2019-2020, Oksana Kolyada, who identified the keywares of discussion. Today, according to her, one of the main problems is the correspondence of legislation with modern realities. The Law of Ukraine "On War Status, Guarantees of their Social Protection" in 1993 is not corresponding to novoy challenges and is unable to meet the current needs. In view of the tight task, the development and adoption of a new legislation, which has read new challenges and met the needs of veterans.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/03-1.jpg" />Oksanakolya</p>
<p>Particular attention was paid to the concept of veterans support system on a par other, emphasizing the need to enlighten all who work with veterans of departments - educators, psychologists, doctors, social workers, police, etc. They should have the skills of working with people who have undergone a war. Kolyada's separateoxana presented the Institute of Case Managers-specialists who will work with veterans and will help to meet their needs at the group level. The task of the case managers will take care of all the needs of the veteran level of the community, developing typical mechanisms for solving their problems-registration of documents, recovery of health, rehabilitation, employment.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Read also:**</p>
<p>-A case manager is one who advises, informs and organizes services. He is in contact with all institutions on the ground with both state and state -owned, local self -government bodies. He leads a profilering and his family. This will protect us from the fact that we will lose information about the need for a particular person, - the expert emphasized.</p>
<h3><strong> Case Managers have to work in every community </strong></h3>
<p>The topic of providing services to veterans from the sector of non -governmental organizations opened the ministerial social policy Ulyana Tokareva.</p>
<ul>
<li>The advantage and problem of social work is that it is allegedly about everything. It is a little about employment and rehabilitation, it is about psychological support, it is about education - absolutely about everything. At the same time, it is a completely specific task - to help a person to get out of a difficult life circumstance, to get out of the one that interferes with him. We, as a central executive body, which responds to the formation of state policy in the field of social services, we form a frame in which everyone who provides social services can work, who is engaged in social work, - she said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veterans need that a professional person, a specialist evaluated their needs, helped them to make a plan of getting out of the situation and accompanied it in the processing of the problem. Such a professional should be the case manager who works in every community, with support from the state, organizational sector, business representatives and more.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/04-1-1.jpg" />Ulyana Tokareva emphasized that in no case can it be postponed and satisfying the needs of veterans at the time after victory, as people are working out to solve their problems now, in real time. Therefore, in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense, the Social Policy Ministry realizes the projects for the preparation of case managers as social workers who are able to meet the needs of veterans and take care of their families.</p>
<p>The expert also drew attention to the prospect of diversification of the social services market, which should become more intense. In its formation, both public authorities and local self -government should participate, public organizations, business. The Ministry of Social Policy is interested in fatigue so that as many communities as possible can provide the necessary services to veterans.</p>
<h3><strong> three variants of grant programs for veterans </strong>Tatiana Berezhna said about what he does the Ministry of Economy to include veterans in business. Since last year, the grant program "Own business", which has become extremely popular - has already published - already published four thousand grants for 250 thousand UAH. Based on this successful attitude, the idea was to launch a similar program for veterans.</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/05-1-1.jpg" />- The veterans program has the following three components. <strong> The first </strong> is a veteran or veterans grant worth UAH 250,000 with the obligation to create one workplace. The essence of this irreversible support from the state is that the veteran of the chevetan receives this grant - 250 thousand UAH, and has to return it for the three years as taxes and fees, - she said.</p>
<p><strong> The second type of grant support </strong> is a grant for the second person from the spouse of the diesel, which can take a grant of UAH 500,000 and has the obligation to operate at least two people. The return of the grant will take place in three years in the form of taxes and fees. The peculiarity of the second grant is that it is provided on co -financing conditions - 30 % invests the recipient himself, 70 %(at least - 500 thousand UAH)The state compensates.</p>
<p><strong> The third kind of grants </strong> for veterans is a grant worth 1 million UAH for a veteran or veterans who have experience in business. He provides employment of at least four, two of whom should be veterans or people with disabilities. The return of this grant is Taxama for three years in the form of taxes and fees.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/06-2.jpg" />The peculiarity of this grant program is that all documents are submitted by <a href="https://diia.gov.ua/services/grant-dlya-veteraniv-ta-chleniv-yihnih-simej">the portal "Action"</a>, where they receive them Savings Bank, where the business provider's business preparation is checked. If the business reputation is perfect, then the Guide must be interviewed at the employment center, which, incidentally, can happen in the way, and remotely - through video binding.</p>
<p>Another feature of the grant is that the funds are not issued in cash. They are accumulated in the special bank account of the Savings Bank only for a certain type of expenses provided by the grant program.</p>
<h3><strong> Entrepreneurs must be facilitated by both the state and society </strong>-Earlier, I believed that veterans-entrepreneurs themselves are a proactive part of social, they are not guilty of anything, they have to do everything alone,-he became. - However, experience shows that veterans need specialization from both the state and society. They have special needs of Iroblems, due to special experience.</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/07-2.jpg" />Sergei</p>
<p>The entrepreneur emphasized the need for special educational courses for veterans who want to engage in entrepreneurship, the need for financing Veteran businesses, talking about positive examples of the activities of the Veterans Association in this field.</p>
<p>Serhiy Poznyak emphasized both the need to interact with the state and to depart from purely paternalistic approaches in the work of the Zetrans. The non -governmental sector that will work for a drink of veteran entrepreneurship should also be active.</p>
<h3><strong> You need to satisfy the veterans' request for reintegration and socialization right now </strong></h3>
<p>The system of support from the war was told by a veterans, the head of NGO "Protection" Kateryna Lutsyk, who advocates the creation of a structure in Khmelnytskyi, to take care of the needs of veterans and should be an example of the interactions of the ocular and non -state sectors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Khmelnytsky region is the second largest number of mobilized, and all active servicemen are our potential audience - these are future veterans of the Jetrans who will return home to their communities after demobilization. It is necessary to be prepared for this, because they will return with the basic request of the nationality and socialization, - she emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T74-00-00-04-00/08-2-1.jpg" />Katerynalitsyk</p>
<p>Kateryna Lutsyk noted the need to clearly understand the real needs of detectives, on the basis of which it will be possible to generate the appropriate mechanisms for these needs. This determines the task of the case managers to establish steady contact with a veteran or veteran and their families and comprehensively study their requests.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the veteran returns home, it is the family that is the first entrance point to the veteran. She should know the intricacies of working with combat trauma, so there will be different aspects and consequences of traumatic experience, - said Lajaekpertka, emphasizing the need to work with members of families of veterans of Uzhezaraz, before the return of Ukrainian defenders home.</li>
</ul>
<p>**</p>
<p>Read also:**</p>
<p>At the end of the work "Veterans - the basis of human capital of Ukraine" Konstantin Tatarkin, veteran and representative of the NGO "Space of Opportunities", touched the then honoring and heroization. He emphasized that honoring a veteran -needed society is much more than the military itself. Ukrainian defenders are the basis of self -identity and model for imitation, so the attention of the Doni determines the future of the Ukrainian nation.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T76-00-00-04-00/muzej-golovna.jpg" />The National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War took place a memorial medal created by art youth from Bucha. During the occupation, the young Ukrainians joined the team, stood, and subsequently founded a DFNRS Brand. Now they seek to show the world the consequences of war, casting a coin medal from the debris of Russian technology.</p>
<p>"The more tragedy, as a child's death, cannot be in life," - the General Director of the Museum of War, Yuriy Savchuk, opened a memorable event dedicated to the youngest victims of the war.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/muzej-01.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T76-00-00-04-00/muzej-01-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

The obverse depicts the sky and the track that the innocent souls go to the other world. The coin also depicts the upper gate's outline, where a multimedia project "[Martyrologist.Children ...] was presented a year ago.(https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/06/04/vidkryto-martyrolog-ditej-zagyblyh-u-period-povnomasshtabnoyi-rosijsko-ukrayinskoyi-vijny/)”.</p>
<p>The reverse of the medal depicts a woman with a closed face and a thorn wreath of Uzlossi, who is the embodiment of mothers who lost children during the war. It will have a darkened silhouette of the child in his hands, because only the memory remained. Nearby-a solid sword as a symbol of revenge of Ukraine-mother for all the dead.</p>
<p>The medal seized a fragment that resembles a fragment. According to the authors, after victory on the wreckage will be the date of end of the war and the number of children. Subsequently, this fragment will complement and complete the medal.</p>
<p>“There should be no this event at all. Children should live, play, learn, bangs, be fun for parents, not die in their beds from night-Russian shelling,-Irina Kotsyabiuk shared in her opinion. “Children should be only for successful schools or high -speed sports.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/muzej-03.jpg"><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T76-00-00-04-00/muzej-03-150x150.jpg" /></a></p>

The event of honoring the memory of the children was joined by Olesivoloshin, the Deputy Head of the Department of Protection of Children and Protity of Domestic Violence of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine. She has been the highest priority now is the memory: not to forget any children and any crime. Unfortunately, the war is ongoing, some territories of Ukraine are dodged, and we can only guess the exposure of which the horrible truth is waiting.</p>
<p>It is difficult to even imagine that at the time of the presentation of the martyrologist on the symbolic altar were presented the names and portraits of 261 children who were killed at the hands of the Russian aggressor. And now this mournful list has grown to 484. For each new figure - the fallen life, stolen dreams, broken fates.</p>
<p>The presented medal is framed by the words from the work of the young poetess Katerynitovstone: "They had how much time, and now - nothingness."</p>
<p>In the future, the commemorative medal will be exhibited at the upper gate.</p>

However, he fails to reside because of the strong resistance of our defense forces. The situation is insignificant, but it changes.</p>
<p>About this Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar <a href="https://t.me/annamaliar/809">wrote</a>In Telegram.</p>
<p>“For several months in a row, the enemy came in the east in four directions - Avdiivsky, Marinsky, Lymansky and Bakhmutsky. Later, he was periodically actually in two directions - Shakhtarsky and Kupyansky. It was not possible to get out at the borders of the Donetsk Luhansk regions of the enemy.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that in all directions the aggressor does not stop firing of air strikes, the geography of offensive actions is somewhat different.</p>

For us, the priority of armored vehicles, the accumulation of personal composition and warehouses with ammunition. We work closely with a respects, because they give us a goal. After working out, we immediately return to the prepared shelter.</p>
<p>Today, as the paratroopers themselves say, they say "fun". Scheobide did not come, as the artillery calculation managed to release more than 15 shells by the enemy and to hit the enemy tank, BMP and the accumulation of living power of the invaders, which were assault on the positions of Ukrainian defenders.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T91-00-00-04-00/foto-5.jpg" />- Our main task here is to support infantry, which I personally consider heroic people. The closer we are to zero, the larger calibers we have alert, but we still hold the system and send our enemy "Clicking", - says battery commander Fedir, and continues: - To say that the sky is clear and clean today, so the occupants Multiple is launched. They tried to storm, but my boys repelled their attempt, protecting our infantry.</p>
<p>The carrier mechanic Anatoly says that his team is the most positive Urobot. Clearly coordinated actions, the full trust of members of the calculation of one and the only dream of all - these aspects give strength and motivation to the paratroopers constantly reflect and restrain the occupiers.</p>
<p><a href="https://armyinform.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/foto-6-1.jpg">!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T91-00-00-04-00/foto-6-1-150x150.jpg)</a></p>

<p>While we expected combat work on hostile positions, Alexander's gunman told about Saush from the inside.</p>

I am sight, level and angular meter. Then I return the vision to the main point of science, after which I exhibit the panorama itself at all levels. When everything is ready, I report to the commander that the car is ready. As soon as the Fire team comes, the charger sends a projectile and we are shot, - said the gunner.</p>
<p>Due to the constant enemy shelling and the high activity of the enemy UAV in the sky, we had to leave the point and descend the vulkey.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our team is one big and friendly family. In addition, we shoot the Ukrainian shells and shoot Polish and Bulgarian shells. I can say that these are quite apt shells. But it all depends primarily on the skill of calculation. The guys are good, accuracy at a high level, beating "excellent", I am proud of them. Each defender is maximally reasoned and realizes that every shot expels the enemy from his native land, - the battery commander Fedir supplemented.</li>
