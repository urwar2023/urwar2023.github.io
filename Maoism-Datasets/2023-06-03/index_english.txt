 Oleksandrhachenko and Vladimir Radchenko in the next "musical history" are amazed by new foods and paradoxes
Europe, as we know, is one, and at the same time - varied. But how diverse, sometimes we even forget. We just don't imagine.
So here you can choose to listen to our story on Spotify or other subconscious platforms:
Or in the video format on the Ukrinform YouTube channel.
We will listen to musicians from different European countries. Known and not very. One thing is one thing - a complete indulgence in a stereotypical idea of a musical scene. For example, France is Chanson, Britain-Rock and Roll, Germany-Ramstein, and Italy is a solid San Remo ... We promise surprises for this drug menu.

Якщо не всім, то більшості. І запити на дзвінки, на розмови,на діалог - тому що все це дає можливість знати правду. Ось і все, для чогомені потрібні ці контакти - саме для цього. Тому що про бізнес ми будемо точноговорити між державами, але після війни. А в час війни - знати правду іпідтримати нас політично, і щодо підтримки, щодо справедливості. Так ось зЧилі у нас все гаразд. Я дуже вдячний”, - сказав Зеленський , спілкуючись із журналісткою зЧилі.

This opinion was expressed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in interview Latin American media, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
“Depends on Russia - military(by - ed.)We de -navigate the territory or not, and only from Russia. And today our partners see, and already those countries that were skeptical. For example, Germany. Chancellor Scholtz openly says: “I believe that Russia is… there is no to talk about it until it leaves the territories(Ukraine - ed.)”. Draw the attention - not until Ukraine is dealing with their military, and until Russia works. Therefore, there is a logic for me. If you want to talk to me and talk to a curved world, you should not wait for you to be over. They will be they, ”Zelensky said.
At the same time, he noted that by dealing of the Russian -owned territory of the Russian Federation in the Ukrainian way, we lose our people.
“The question is not in time. We do not get tired for the sake of victory. The question is not in time, the question in people. And if we knock out the force(Russians from Ukraine - ed.), then, believe me, when we will squeeze them out of our territory, what do we talk about with them? What is the point to speak? I think that then Russia will look for themselves other leaders who will be able to find an approach to the whole civilized world, to find the opportunity for people to sit with them at least something to say something, because after they did, no one is ready for dialogue with them. . This is if we knock out the force, so such a big difference, ”said Zelensky .

Zelensky expressed his belief that Ukraine has been depriving its territories to Tann on the importance of what way it would be.
“It is very important to lose people or not to reduce losses. It is very important to me. And then it depends on, again, whether we are ready for any communion, ”the head of the Ukrainian state added.
In his opinion, "any other leadership of the Russian Federation will be looking for a output from this situation."He stressed that the war is taking place in Ukraine, not Russia.
“The war is here. Them(Russians - ed.)I would like to talk that something is reflected in Russia. Nothing is happening there. I will tell you, u have some weapons that we do not use in Russia, because we have stolen us, for example, "Himars", which we have no right to use the gerrulates of other states, Russia. We are talking about Russia today. That is, we use in the territories of our temporarily occupied, so, the impressive goals and affecting some warehouses with ammunition, etc. You already know Russia. If we have a powerfully impressed targets in the Russian Federation, believe me, there would be a lot of casualties. Truth? We see what 50, 100 rockets are, widening for us. We see what sacrifices are visible. And we know what the Russian Federation is. If they had any casualties, believe me, the whole information space would be in this. And this is a fact. They can make a whole information bubble, ”the head of the Ukrainian state said.

 Children's crying to the sounds of sirens ... Everyone knows that it is very difficult when you cannot protect the baby from the threat. Therefore, when we talk about the defense today, it is first and foremost about literal protection. From death, injuries, suffering, from death.
About this the first lady of Ukraine Elena Zelenskaya wrote in telegrams.
Protection of children means that they should not die under the wreckage of rockets and rubble homes. Should not lose health, arms and legs.
The abduction should not be victims - and Russia has exported more than 19,000 our children.
Protection of children means protection against orphanage - that is why, in the most difficult times, Ukraine is moving to family forms of education to get rid of orphanages.
Protection of children means that they should not become forced displaced persons - in their own or in another country. Should not miss the home and loved ones.
Protection of children involves the protection of their right to study and development - they are innocent to study in bomb shelters and to distinguish missiles and drones by sound. And the cesame is what Ukrainian children do.
But this is a danger not only to our children. When a childhood in one country as a rise, it is at risk. It is a challenge to all parents and adults. You can only respond to it together.
-participated in an online mode at the Child Protection Conference(EUsupport for Reconstruction and Reform of Ukraine’s Child Protection System), which takes place in Sweden. According to a memorandum between these instances, Sweden will be a partner of Ukraine in protecting children. I am grateful for this cooperation. We will be able to help not only Ukrainian children, but also childhood in general. In order for a baby in any city in the world she cried at night to the sounds of sirens, ”said Elena Zelenskaya.

 Experts, representatives of state power bodies of Tagnian society took part in the work of the section.
Case Managers-an effective tool to meet the needs of veterans 
The meeting of the coalition coalition was opened, by the Minister of Vetrans in 2019-2020, Oksana Kolyada, who identified the keywares of discussion. Today, according to her, one of the main problems is the correspondence of legislation with modern realities. The Law of Ukraine "On War Status, Guarantees of their Social Protection" in 1993 is not corresponding to novoy challenges and is unable to meet the current needs. In view of the tight task, the development and adoption of a new legislation, which has read new challenges and met the needs of veterans.
 Oksanakolya
Particular attention was paid to the concept of veterans support system on a par other, emphasizing the need to enlighten all who work with veterans of departments - educators, psychologists, doctors, social workers, police, etc. They should have the skills of working with people who have undergone a war. Kolyada's separateoxana presented the Institute of Case Managers-specialists who will work with veterans and will help to meet their needs at the group level. The task of the case managers will take care of all the needs of the veteran level of the community, developing typical mechanisms for solving their problems-registration of documents, recovery of health, rehabilitation, employment.

-A case manager is one who advises, informs and organizes services. He is in contact with all institutions on the ground with both state and state -owned, local self -government bodies. He leads a profilering and his family. This will protect us from the fact that we will lose information about the need for a particular person, - the expert emphasized.
Case Managers have to work in every community 
The topic of providing services to veterans from the sector of non -governmental organizations opened the ministerial social policy Ulyana Tokareva.
Veterans need that a professional person, a specialist evaluated their needs, helped them to make a plan of getting out of the situation and accompanied it in the processing of the problem. Such a professional should be the case manager who works in every community, with support from the state, organizational sector, business representatives and more.
 Ulyana Tokareva emphasized that in no case can it be postponed and satisfying the needs of veterans at the time after victory, as people are working out to solve their problems now, in real time. Therefore, in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense, the Social Policy Ministry realizes the projects for the preparation of case managers as social workers who are able to meet the needs of veterans and take care of their families.
The expert also drew attention to the prospect of diversification of the social services market, which should become more intense. In its formation, both public authorities and local self -government should participate, public organizations, business. The Ministry of Social Policy is interested in fatigue so that as many communities as possible can provide the necessary services to veterans.
three variants of grant programs for veterans Tatiana Berezhna said about what he does the Ministry of Economy to include veterans in business. Since last year, the grant program "Own business", which has become extremely popular - has already published - already published four thousand grants for 250 thousand UAH. Based on this successful attitude, the idea was to launch a similar program for veterans. 
 - The veterans program has the following three components. The first is a veteran or veterans grant worth UAH 250,000 with the obligation to create one workplace. The essence of this irreversible support from the state is that the veteran of the chevetan receives this grant - 250 thousand UAH, and has to return it for the three years as taxes and fees, - she said.
The second type of grant support is a grant for the second person from the spouse of the diesel, which can take a grant of UAH 500,000 and has the obligation to operate at least two people. The return of the grant will take place in three years in the form of taxes and fees. The peculiarity of the second grant is that it is provided on co -financing conditions - 30 % invests the recipient himself, 70 %(at least - 500 thousand UAH)The state compensates.
The third kind of grants for veterans is a grant worth 1 million UAH for a veteran or veterans who have experience in business. He provides employment of at least four, two of whom should be veterans or people with disabilities. The return of this grant is Taxama for three years in the form of taxes and fees.
 The peculiarity of this grant program is that all documents are submitted by the portal "Action" , where they receive them Savings Bank, where the business provider's business preparation is checked. If the business reputation is perfect, then the Guide must be interviewed at the employment center, which, incidentally, can happen in the way, and remotely - through video binding.
Another feature of the grant is that the funds are not issued in cash. They are accumulated in the special bank account of the Savings Bank only for a certain type of expenses provided by the grant program.
Entrepreneurs must be facilitated by both the state and society -Earlier, I believed that veterans-entrepreneurs themselves are a proactive part of social, they are not guilty of anything, they have to do everything alone,-he became. - However, experience shows that veterans need specialization from both the state and society. They have special needs of Iroblems, due to special experience. 
 Sergei
The entrepreneur emphasized the need for special educational courses for veterans who want to engage in entrepreneurship, the need for financing Veteran businesses, talking about positive examples of the activities of the Veterans Association in this field.
Serhiy Poznyak emphasized both the need to interact with the state and to depart from purely paternalistic approaches in the work of the Zetrans. The non -governmental sector that will work for a drink of veteran entrepreneurship should also be active.
You need to satisfy the veterans' request for reintegration and socialization right now 
The system of support from the war was told by a veterans, the head of NGO "Protection" Kateryna Lutsyk, who advocates the creation of a structure in Khmelnytskyi, to take care of the needs of veterans and should be an example of the interactions of the ocular and non -state sectors.
 Katerynalitsyk
Kateryna Lutsyk noted the need to clearly understand the real needs of detectives, on the basis of which it will be possible to generate the appropriate mechanisms for these needs. This determines the task of the case managers to establish steady contact with a veteran or veteran and their families and comprehensively study their requests.

 The National Museum of History of Ukraine in the Second World War took place a memorial medal created by art youth from Bucha. During the occupation, the young Ukrainians joined the team, stood, and subsequently founded a DFNRS Brand. Now they seek to show the world the consequences of war, casting a coin medal from the debris of Russian technology.
"The more tragedy, as a child's death, cannot be in life," - the General Director of the Museum of War, Yuriy Savchuk, opened a memorable event dedicated to the youngest victims of the war.
!(Images/AРМІЯINFORM/2023-06-03T76-00-00-04-00/muzej-01-150x150.jpg) 
 The commemorative medal presented at the War Museum was created from a fragment of an armored soldier, destroyed between Bucha and Irpin on March 4, 20122. The obverse depicts the sky and the track that the innocent souls go to the other world. The coin also depicts the upper gate's outline, where a multimedia project "[Martyrologist.Children ...] was presented a year ago.(https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/06/04/vidkryto-martyrolog-ditej-zagyblyh-u-period-povnomasshtabnoyi-rosijsko-ukrayinskoyi-vijny/)”.
The reverse of the medal depicts a woman with a closed face and a thorn wreath of Uzlossi, who is the embodiment of mothers who lost children during the war. It will have a darkened silhouette of the child in his hands, because only the memory remained. Nearby-a solid sword as a symbol of revenge of Ukraine-mother for all the dead.
The medal seized a fragment that resembles a fragment. According to the authors, after victory on the wreckage will be the date of end of the war and the number of children. Subsequently, this fragment will complement and complete the medal.
“There should be no this event at all. Children should live, play, learn, bangs, be fun for parents, not die in their beds from night-Russian shelling,-Irina Kotsyabiuk shared in her opinion. “Children should be only for successful schools or high -speed sports.
 
 The project was brought to life with the assistance of the team of the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, which became a reliable partner of the museum in coverage of heavy and tragic aspects of war. The event of honoring the memory of the children was joined by Olesivoloshin, the Deputy Head of the Department of Protection of Children and Protity of Domestic Violence of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine. She has been the highest priority now is the memory: not to forget any children and any crime. Unfortunately, the war is ongoing, some territories of Ukraine are dodged, and we can only guess the exposure of which the horrible truth is waiting.
It is difficult to even imagine that at the time of the presentation of the martyrologist on the symbolic altar were presented the names and portraits of 261 children who were killed at the hands of the Russian aggressor. And now this mournful list has grown to 484. For each new figure - the fallen life, stolen dreams, broken fates.
The presented medal is framed by the words from the work of the young poetess Katerynitovstone: "They had how much time, and now - nothingness."
In the future, the commemorative medal will be exhibited at the upper gate.
